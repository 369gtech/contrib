description: 'Recent work in the area of computational modeling for neuroimaging has brought about a potential revolution in understanding brain function. Using both machine learning and Neural Network methodology, both valid localization and brain interactivity are now becoming commonplace in the analysis and intepretation of brain maps. I will provide a short motivation and tutorial for brain imaging methods (in particular, fMRI) and then discuss several applications including FACE recognition in the brain showing a more combinatorial feature basis for object representations. Finally I will explore recent brain connectivity analysis of subjects watching movies ("The good, the bad and the ugly") and novel...'
