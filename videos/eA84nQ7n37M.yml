description: "Today's developer needs to rapidly build and deploy code in a consistent, predictable, and declarative manner. This session will illustrate how companies can leverage PKS, Kubernetes, Harbor, Clair, and Concourse to achieve these goals. The session will provide a solution overview for developing, building, and deploying applications using Container technologies from VMware and Pivotal. A brief review of each of the technologies being discussed will be provided. The session will include a proposed end to end solution leveraging all of these technologies to provide a better developer experience.
