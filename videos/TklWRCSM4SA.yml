The key problem here is obvious; Even if your application is executable, it might not be readable or understandable for other Developers. Luckily Laravel is great in helping you keep your code organized, separate functionality and handle peak workloads, even if you might not be able to avoid refactoring at some point, it’s way less painful. With Vapor on the horizon and most concerns about infrastructure scalability out of the way, in this talk, we will focus on Laravel's: Service Containers, Events and Queues. Showing how they help you keep your application organized and modularize even on the go."
