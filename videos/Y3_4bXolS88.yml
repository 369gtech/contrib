description: "Enterprise DevOps and Unicorns\n\nMark Imbriaco, Director, Platform Architecture, Pivotal \n\nMy DOES 16 keynote last year discussed lessons learned running operations at places like Basecamp, Heroku, GitHub, and DigitalOcean. This year I've spent a lot of time working with Fortune 100 organizations to adapt those lessons to the realities of a large enterprise. We'll revisit some of the lessons I presented last year along with other experiences from previous roles and explore how they apply in practice to the enterprises I work with today.\n\nDevOps Enterprise Summit San Francisco 2017\nevents.itrevolution.com/US\nIT Revolution\nitrevolution.com"
