description: "The functional programming community has a number of patterns with strange names such as monads, monoids, functors, and catamorphisms.\n\nIn this beginner-friendly talk, we'll demystify these techniques and see how they all fit together into a small but versatile \"tool kit\". \n\nWe'll then see how the tools in this tool kit can be applied to a wide variety of programming problems, such as handling missing data, working with lists, and implementing the functional equivalent of dependency injection.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
