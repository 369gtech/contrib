description: "DevOpsDays Baltimore 2019 - Observability Observed by Aaron Aldrich\n\nIn DevOps, especially on the Ops side of the house, it seems you can’t outrun this Observability term, but what is it? Monitoring with a new name? A marketing gimmick for new infrastructure tools? Something about dynamic linear systems? And why should I care? And if I do care, how do I get started?\n\nIn 5 minutes or less we'll introduce what Observability is, convince you to care, and give you some starting points and guidelines to think about as you get started with a slide reserved for “where to go from here”. Or for further discussion: let’s Open Space about that.\n\n#confreaks #devopsdaysbmore"
