description: "So you're logging in to your favorite crypto currency exchange over https using a username and password, executing some transactions, and you're not at all surprised that, security wise, everything's hunky dory...\n\nIn order to appreciate and understand what goes on under the hood, as a developer, it's really important to dive into the key concepts of cryptography .\n\nIn this session, we'll go back to JCA (Java Cryptography API) en JCE (Java Cryptography Extensions) basics, like message digests, symmetric and asymmetric encryption, and digital signatures, and see how they're used in a variety of examples like https and certificates, salted password checking, and block chain technology.\n\nAfter this session, you'll have a better understanding of Java Cryptography APIs and their applications."
