title: 'Paweł Limanówka "Comet, Ajax, web browsers limitations and web apps performance factors"'
recordingDate: 1358526323
description: "In projects from my past, one specific requirement was surfacing surprisingly often -- to efficiently provide large number of simultaneous users with frequent and timely updates of data in a web app. This is fairly common requirement, especially in apps for financial or gaming sector. As you can imagine, there are few common, well known solutions to that problem -- most of them grouped under umbrella-term „Comet\".\n\nBasic ideas behind those are deceptively simple; it's relatively easy to build PoC level Comet solution, but often proves to be both tricky and tedious task to make it fly under real world conditions. As „getting it right\" few first times took some investigation and led to interesting, yet hard-to-google findings, I think that you may find short summary of my experiences with Comet interesting and worth your time."
