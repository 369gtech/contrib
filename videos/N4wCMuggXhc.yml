With the growing community the development velocity of the Prometheus increased, allowing us to improve things further. While the number of external integrations grows, Prometheus still pushes the boundaries of what is achievable with vanilla capabilities of out-of-box solution. During this talk Goutham and Bartek, Prometheus Maintainers, will walk through those advanced usage patterns of the Prometheus and new, useful features available in newest versions. \n\nhttps://sched.co/cpB8"
