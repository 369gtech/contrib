description: "Alex Badyan: Orchestrating Serverless Flows\n\nAlex Badyan, Tech Lead @ Vonage\n\nSoftware enthusiast, focused mostly on backend. Love architecture and design. Dealing a lot with AWS cloud in recent years and the serverless challenges it brings.\n\nUsing AWS Step Functions to orchestrate your serverless components\nServerless is a a very convenient way to quickly write and deploy code, but keeping state and orchestrating flows is harder to achieve. This session will demonstrate one way to solve this issue using AWSâ€™s Step Functions. We will see how state, scaling, error handling and parallelization can be achieved via configuration by looking at a service implemented @ Vonage using this technology. We will also discuss drawbacks and which use cases are a good fit for Step Functions."
