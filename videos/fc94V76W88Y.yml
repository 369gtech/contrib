It provides an ecosystem for the development of client-side web applications. The ecosystem for development may include external tools or libraries as well. The ecosystem process includes project bootstrapping, development operations/tools, testing, and build support.\nOne of the best features of Angular framework is that it is quite flexible when it comes to the usage of external libraries apart from the scalability it provides.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGot a question on the topic?\nPlease share it in the comment section below and our experts will answer it for you.\n\nPlease write back to us at sales@edureka.in or call us at IND: 9606058406 / US: 18338555775 (toll-free) for more information."
