title: 'Rik Arends: Multi-threaded JavaScript inside Makepad'
language: English
recordingDate: 1476283044
description: "As a web developer since the early 2000s, Rik has lived through the ups and downs of browsers all the way from IE3 to Chrome 52. From doing interactive web projects for big brands to working on Cloud9 IDE, the limitations of HTML have always been there. After leaving Cloud9 four years ago to explore the new possibilities that WebGL offers for UI, a continuous stream of WebGL-related projects have appeared, including a JavaScript trace debugger, a compile-to-JavaScript language and a live coding prototyping framework. Makepad is the latest from-scratch iteration of this WebGL direction, and it is exciting to share the progress and lessons learned.\n\nhttps://www.meetup.com/AmsterdamJS/events/233107619/"
