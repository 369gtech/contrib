description: "Nowadays it’s difficult to find any hardware vendor who develops all the components present in their platform. The big piece of it outsourced to OEM’s includes firmware too. That creates additional complexity and limits hardware vendor control under the platform. That creates not only supply chain security risks but also produce security gaps in the threat modeling process by design.\n\n\n\nIn most cases hardware vendor separate threat model and security boundaries for each hardware component present on the platform but in reality, it misses a lot of details which is directly reflected on platform security. This talk will look through the prism security problems and vulnerabilities created over those architecture design mistakes.\n\n\n=== \n\n\nAlex Matrosov is a chief offensive security researcher at NVIDIA. He has more than two decades of experience with reverse engineering,advanced malware analysis, firmware security, and exploitationtechniques. Before joining NVIDIA, Alex served as Principal SecurityResearcher at Intel Security Center of Excellence (SeCoE), spent morethan six years in the Intel Advanced Threat Research team, and wasSenior Security Researcher at ESET. Alex has authored and co-authorednumerous research papers and is a frequent speaker at securityconferences, including REcon, ZeroNights, Black Hat, DEFCON, andothers."
