recordingDate: 1602542279
description: "In 1985, the time machine was invented by Dr. Emmett Brown.\nThose who copied his invention and set their destination dates to January 2038 and onwards, however, most likely never made it.\nThis talk explains the Year 2038 Problem, an integer overflow issue similar to the well-known Y2K bug, which will hit 32-bit systems, applications and databases in the year 2038."
