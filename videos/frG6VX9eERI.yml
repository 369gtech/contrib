description: "Developing blockchain applications can require specialized resources and take time. Oracle’s new Blockchain App Builder for Oracle Blockchain Platform can eliminate or reduce coding, and make the development and testing more efficient. Oracle has released the Blockchain App Builder component in the Oracle Blockchain Platform, which includes an integrated development environment with GUI and command line interfaces to accelerate development of new applications built on blockchain technology.\n\nThe Oracle Blockchain Platform’s App Builder now provides tooling to develop, test, debug and deploy chaincodes together with code generation capabilities to turn a declarative specification of the assets and their behaviors into a functioning smart contract with CRUD methods and interfaces. This includes:\n\n• IDE with a GUI and command line interfaces\n• Code generation of basic asset CRUD functions in TypeScript and Golang from the declarative specification of the assets\n• Support for full Hyperledger Fabric chaincode lifecycle operations, such as package, install, instantiate, and upgrade\n• Immediate deployment and testing on a locally installed blockchain network\n• Deployment to and testing with remote Oracle blockchain networks\n• Effective debugging support and stateDB queries for unit testing\n\nThe new Blockchain App Builder can help developers:\n\n• Expedite chaincode development and experimentation cycles\n• Support chaincode generation and maintainability for complex apps\n\nIt can also help users with no coding background:\n• Create chaincode projects for smart contracts\n• Specify assets to be tracked on-chain and related validation rules\n• Generate and deploy the chaincode for testing\n• Update specification and automatically re-generate and re-deploy the chaincode\nhttps://developer.oracle.com/"
