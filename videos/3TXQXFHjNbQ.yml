description: "DOES18 Las Vegas â€” Growth by acquisition has long been a strategy for AGCO. While successful for the business as a whole, that growth created challenges for their digital transformation. A dozen globally-dispersed groups were used to doing things their own way and were resistant to change. They lacked a common language and process for doing software releases, starting at the build stage. This talk will illustrate how AGCO: Used communication and visibility to break down silos and share best practices and how to get disparate groups to want to come on board to the common processes.\n\nHow Common Processes and Communication Helped AGCO Grow\n\nErik Maziarz, IT Systems Administrator II, AGCO\n\nErik Maziarz is an IT System Administrator and Technical Lead at the AGCO Corporation.
