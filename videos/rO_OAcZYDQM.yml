language: English
recordingDate: 1632350796
description: 'This presentation focuses on the use of barcodes on ballots, specifically barcodes on ballots that store vote selections. Skoglund teaches us how voting systems store votes and barcodes, explains how to decode them, and explores their attack surface from a security perspective. Through close examination of three examples (ES&S ExpressVote, Dominion ImageCast X, Unisyn Freedom Vote Tablet), the presentation explains potential attacks, and highlights detection and mitigation strategies.'
