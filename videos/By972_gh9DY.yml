description: "If an action speaks in the forest and no one hears it, did it make a sound? The focus for this talk is discovery -- we want users to be able to find the awesome Actions on Google experiences you've built. We’ll talk about triggering, directory listings, submissions, and overall best practices for getting your experience discovered by Google Assistant users.\n\nSee all the talks from Google I/O '17 here: https://goo.gl/D0D4VE\nWatch more Android talks at I/O '17 here: https://goo.gl/c0LWYl\nWatch more Chrome talks at I/O '17 here: https://goo.gl/Q1bFGY\nWatch more Firebase talks at I/O '17 here: https://goo.gl/pmO4Dr\n\nSubscribe to the Google Developers channel: http://goo.gl/mQyv5L\n\n#io17 #GoogleIO #GoogleIO2017"
