description: '#Codemotion Rome 2018 - The major contribution of the Blockchain technology, is providing a solution to the problem of consensus in distributed systems. But not every distributed consensus platform is a blockchain! I will introduce the problem of consensus, its various forms, the concept of proof of work and alternative mechanisms like proof of stake. There will be also a live game where participants will play the miners and have fun validating transactions!'
