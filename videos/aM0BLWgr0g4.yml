description: "Arjan Scherpenisse - Chatbot programmer, Elixir evangelist\nThe Elixir parser under the microscope\n\nTalk in three words: parsers, AST, manipulations\n\nAbstract\nThe Elixir parser can be used for purposes other than compiling code. For example, to transform the AST into SQL fragments. Even a basic, interpreted \"Elixir-ish\" programming language is easy to build, in a few hundred lines of code. However, using the built in parser also has its drawbacks: it creates atoms, and the AST is non-reversible. In this talk, Arjan will zoom in on the inner workings of the Elixir parser and his efforts to create a non-destructive, \"atom-safe\" Elixir parser.\n\nThe speaker \nArjan Scherpenisse is an experienced Elixir and Erlang developer. After freelancing as a backend developer for several years, he founded his startup Botsquad, an Elixir-powered chatbot platform, on which he now works full-time. Besides coding, he really enjoys teaching and transferring his knowledge to the next generation of software developers.\nGithub: arjan\nTwitter: @acscherp\n\nElixirConf EU\nWebsite: www.elixirconf.eu\nTwitter: www.twitter.com/elixirconfeu\nMail: info at elixirconfeu"
