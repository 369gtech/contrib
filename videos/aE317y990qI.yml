description: 'Frank is a strategic marketing consultant with a strong focus on user experience and a proven adeptness in forecasting market trends. Frank works with established artists and brands to develop unique business opportunities into customer-centric branded experiences. He is focused on building lasting resonance between consumers and businesses worldwide. The opportunity for full legalization in the United States looms over the horizon. The impact however, reaches far beyond the cursory recreational, medicinal, and social benefits. This talk reveals how the mass social engineering effort behind cannabis legalization could be a strategic play to protect against the decoupling of the petrodollar system. We touch upon players & history behind regulation, extrapolate how legalizing today enables the U.S. to reopen and control the renegotiation of major trade treaties such as the WTO, then finally elucidate the knock-on effects with respect to individual security and self sovereignty. By legalizing cannabis, the U.S. is paving the way to control a multi-trillion dollar constellation of industries spanning petrochemical, pharmaceutical, and forestry industries via the industrial hemp market. Through simple examples, this talk reveals how all the pieces glue together and lays out a framework of what their respective impacts might be.'
