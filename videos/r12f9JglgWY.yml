description: 'It''s a talk about the new serverless architecture movement that is happening using new technologies like AWS Lambda, API Gateway and DynamoDB. This new way of building architectures opens up a whole new dimension of scalability and cost effectiveness. By using microservices that run in AWS Lambda functions, you literrally pay 0 euro when your code doesn''t execute. As an added benefit you won''t have to deal with devops, so no server configuration or security updates.'
