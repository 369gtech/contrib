title: 'The Future of Rails 6: Scalable by Default'
language: English
recordingDate: 1527184800
description: "We've all heard the phrase \"Rails doesn't scale\". Long running test suites and no standard for implementing multiple databases makes it hard scale monolithic Rails applications. Rails 6 will start making Rails scalable by default with parallel testing and improved support for using multiple databases. You'll no longer be forced to reinvent the wheel and create your own solution to these problems. In this talk we'll take a look why these improvements are important, how they work, and ways in which small ideas can quickly snowball into major changes. This is just the beginning of Rails 6.\n\nEVENT:\n\nRailsConf 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nEileen Uchitelle\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8evXWvM4oXM"
