title: 'DOES15 - Mirco Hering - Adopting DevOps Practices for Systems of Record – An Experience Report'
recordingDate: 1446772662
description: "Mirco Hering, Agile & DevOps Lead, Accenture\n\nSystems of record are often seen as especially difficult to deal with in regards to Agile adoption and DevOps practices. But is that a reason to avoid them? Unfortunately often people don’t talk about the messy work that is required to make these systems work in an Agile environment, it looks so much cleaner with web applications or your custom Java application. Let’s get our hands dirty together in this talk.\n\nI will show you that once you drill open the COTS and Enterprise systems you will be surprised to find common ground, that allows you to deal with these systems in a very similar way to your custom development applications. I work with enterprise grade applications (for example Siebel, Mainframe) all the time and I want to share with you what you can do to make your COTS and Enterprise systems work better in an Agile environment. I provide tangible examples from Siebel and Mainframe to illustrate how you can solve some of the problems and will also share some of the areas that I have failed in so far."
