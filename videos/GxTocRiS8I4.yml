Cluster API provides clusterctl, which can be configured with environment variables and allows the generation of Kubernetes manifests that describe your workload clusters. While this provides a great on-boarding experience, managing and wrangling more YAML isn't something we're all yearning to do. Fortunately, there's a better way. Introducing Cluster API bindings for TypeScript, Go, and Python. In this talk, I'll introduce you to managing Cluster API through your favourite programming languages."
