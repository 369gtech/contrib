description: "Till Krempel\nTechnical Consultant / Sr. Android Developer, Cologne Intelligence - Mobile Minds\n\nAUGMENTED REALITY FOR EVERYONE, EVERYWHERE WITH ARCORE\nAndroid Game Development & Virtual Reality\nTalk\nIntermediate\n\n\nAugmented Reality for everyone, everywhere with ARCore\n\nOver the last years, a variety of solutions for creating augmented reality user interfaces on mobile devices have evolved. Now, with the release of ARCore, publishing AR applications to one billion Android users has become possible, no extra SDKs or hardware needed.\n\nEnvironment understanding makes the physical surroundings of the device quantifiable with centimeter grade precision, therefore augmentations can be anchored to real locations in reality’s three-dimensional space. ARCore’s motion tracking offers an innovative alternative to existing indoor positioning solutions, improves their precision and framerate by magnitudes and makes their infrastructural preconditions (iBeacon grids, Wi-Fi) obsolete. \n\nBy using the frameworks lighting estimation, the rendered objects truly embed into their real environment.\n\nThe session demonstrates ARCore’s features, and discovers specific challenges encountered while developing for AR. Also, a quick overview on the evolution of augmented reality devices is given and implications for the future of mobile computing (ARCloud) and positioning technology (VPS) on a global scale will be discussed."
