description: "In this two hour hands-on workshop you will play the role of both the red team and the blue team. We have set up an isolated environment for each attendee to go through a Purple Team Exercise. Attendees will be able to create adversary emulation campaigns with SCYTHE and run them in a small environment consisting of a domain controller, member server, and a Linux system. While the attendee is the red team operator, they will also play the role of the blue team looking for Indicators of Compromise and adversary behavior mapped to MITRE ATT&CK Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures. Attendees will learn the basics of adversary emulation (powered by SCYTHE) and blue team tools such as Sysmon, WireShark, and others. It will be a fun two hours of hands-on learning!\n\n\n\nA purple team is a virtual, functional team where teams work together to measure and improve defensive security posture (people, process, and technology):\n\n\n    CTI provides threat actor with capability, intent, and opportunity to attack\n    Red Team creates adversary emulation plan\n    Tabletop discussion with defenders about the attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and expected defenses\n    Emulation of each adversary behavior (TTPs)\n    Blue Team looks for indicators of behavior and/or improvement opportunities\n    Red and Blue work together to create remediation action plan\n    Repeat for next set of TTPs\n\n\n--- \n\n\nThis workshop will cover a hands-on walkthrough of the free Purple Team Exercise Framework: https://github.com/scythe-io/purple-team-exercise-framework/blob/master/PurpleTeamExerciseFramework.pdf While we have held non-hands-on workshops, this one is full hands on. As a pre-req we would prefer attendees watch the non-hands-on walkthrough or at least review the PTEF document. The non-hands-on is here: https://vimeo.com/446501220\n\n\n=== \n\n\nJorge Orchilles is the Chief Technology Officer of SCYTHE and co-creator of the C2 Matrix project.
