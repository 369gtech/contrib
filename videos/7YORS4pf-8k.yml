title: 'PyData Hamburg July ''20 meetup (feat. moinworld): Wound Documentation & Big Data in Climate Science'
language: English
recordingDate: 1595832505
description: "# (Talk 1) Sivan Biham: Wound documentation and measurement using a single smartphone camera\n\nTraditional wound management relies on subjective visual assessment. It lacks standardization and comprehensive documentation, making evidence-based care decisions difficult. In this talk Sivan will describe how Healthy. io uses computer vision and machine learning algorithms to turn a single smartphone camera into a tool for standardizing wound measurements in a clinical setting.\n\nSivan is a Computer Vision and Machine Learning Algorithm Developer at Healthy. io. She holds a B.Sc in computer science and neuroscience and a M.Sc in computer science from the Weizmann Institute of Science.\n\n---------\n# (Talk 2) Aaron Spring: Python for Big Data in Climate Science\n\nClimate scientists analyze massive amounts of data to understand the earth system - around 30PB for the upcoming IPCC report. Frameworks such as xarray and dask extend numpy to handle these larger-than-memory data challenges. Aaron demonstrates a workflow from the viewpoint of a climate scientist and invites you to play around with publicly available climate data.\n\nAaron is a PhD candidate in the ocean biogeochemistry research group at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology.\n\nFollow us on Twitter for the latest updates: https://twitter.com/PyDataHamburg\n\nJoin our LinkedIn group here: https://www.linkedin.com/groups/8932262/\n\n---------\nPyData is a community for developers and users of open source data tools. PyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. The PyData Code of Conduct governs this meetup.\n\nThe goal of moinworld is to create a developer community where women and girls have the same opportunities to shape our digital future as men have. We do this by empowering women. By teaching them the necessary skills and letting them thrive in a supportive community."
