description: "Enabling Cloud Foundry to Run on Bare Metal - Brian Roche, EMC\n\nFor years, Cloud Foundry users have been asking for the functionality to deploy Cloud Foundry on bare metal machines. With the new RackHD CPI, Bosh is now empowered to provision bare-metal machines, deploy software on them, and monitor the health of deployments.  In this talk we will describe the work we have done over the past 12 months to enable Cloud Foundry to run on bare metal machines."
