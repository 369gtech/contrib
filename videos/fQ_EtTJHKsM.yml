Besides the examples above, this session addresses numerous other topics, including\n \n&bull; What is floating-point arithmetic, and what rules does it follow?\n\n&bull; How does floating-point arithmetic work in Java?\n\n&bull; What are the most common floating-point mistakes in Java, and how can they be avoided?\n\n\nAuthor:\n Joseph Darcy\nJoe Darcy is a Consulting Member of Technical Staff in the Java Platform Group.\nView more trainings by  Joseph Darcy at https://www.parleys.com/author/joseph-darcy-4\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
