title: 'Serverless? Not so FaaS! by Matt Stine'

description: "There are multiple incarnations of what we’re calling serverless, including the category of services formerly known as “(mobile) backend as a service” or MBaaS, as well as the more recent “functions as a service” or FaaS. While these two categories are quite distinct, they both revolve around the next evolutionary step from microservices, abstracting away nearly all of the mortar necessary to compose your bricks into solutions. First movers in these spaces include providers such as Auth0 and Amazon Lambda. Nearly all of these solutions are immature, but also show great promise. The learner should leave this session with a solid understanding of the serverless landscape and be able to confront the hype in an effective manner.\n\nMatt Stine is a 17 year veteran of the enterprise IT industry, with eight of those years spent as a consulting solutions architect for multiple Fortune 500 companies. He is the author of Migrating to Cloud-Native Application Architectures from O’Reilly, and the host of the Software Architecture Radio podcast. He is currently the product owner for Spring at Pivotal, and spends much of his time driving an active feedback loop between the Spring R&D organization and customers developing cloud-native application architectures."
