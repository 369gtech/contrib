description: "Eric Bidelman \n\nhttp://moreawesomeweb.com\n\nThe web continues to evolve at an accelerated rate. It's hard to keep up! This session will cover the bleeding-edge features of HTML5 that you may have missed, focusing on features that make developers' lives easier and apps more powerful. A heavy focus will be on freshly landed CSS/JS/HTML primitives which address layout, performance, and specific use cases...especially on mobile: @viewport, @supports, intrinsic/viewport units, resolution & pointer media queries, User/Resource Timing APIs, JS i18n API, iframe goodies, and more.\n\nFor all I/O 2013 sessions, go to https://developers.google.com/live"
