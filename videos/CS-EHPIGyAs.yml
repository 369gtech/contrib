description: "A great product idea is the start of a challenging journey. There are several critical steps start-ups have to go to successfully establishing an IoT solution in the market. What are the dos and donts of creating a functional prototype, finding the right technology partners, and making the solution ready for mass production. With existing development tools like Arduino or Java prototypes can be built very quickly. However, creating an IoT solution which could be sold thousands of times is different and time-consuming. You have to set-up a robust solution with suitable hardware components, meet certification and mass requirements - huge barriers to overcome for start-ups.\n\nMarkus will give a deep expert insight into the technology side of creating a successful IoT solution ready for mass production.\n\nThe speech was given on 2017-05-18 at infoShare 2017 (Startup Stage) in Gda≈Ñsk.\nhttp://infoshare.pl\n\nFollow infoShare:\nhttps://facebook.com/infosharepl\nhttps://twitter.com/infosharepl\nhttps://instagram.com/infoshare/\nhttps://linkedin.com/company-beta/1272775/\nhttps://plus.google.com/+infoshare/"
