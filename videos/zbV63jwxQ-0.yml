description: "Erlang User Conference 2012 \n\nwww.erlang-solutions.com\nwww.erlang-factory.com\n\n\"This talk is about the idea of OpenFlow and how we brought it to life using Erlang. I'm going to speak about the design decisions we made and the problems we encountered when implementing an OpenFlow 1.2 software switch in Erlang. I will also describe the process of integrating it with the existing OpenFlow tools that all speak OpenFlow version 1.0 and how we used QuickCheck to test everything.\"\n\nFollow us on Twitter @Erlangfactory  https://twitter.com/#!/erlangfactory \nJoin our group on Linkedin Erlang Factory  http://www.linkedin.com/groups/Erlang-Factory-2003110?trk=myg_ugrp_ovr"
