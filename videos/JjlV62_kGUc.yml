title: 'Defense Against Adversarial Attacks'
language: English
recordingDate: 1569954975
description: "Machine Learning technology isn't perfect, it's vulnerable to many different types of attacks! In this episode, I'll explain 2 common types of attacks and 2 common types of defenses using various code demos from across the Web. There's some really dope mathematics involved with adversarial attacks, and it was a lot of fun reading about the 'cat and mouse' game between new attack techniques, followed by new defense techniques. I encourage anyone new to the field who finds this stuff interesting to learn more about it. I definitely plan to. Let's look into some math, code, and examples.
