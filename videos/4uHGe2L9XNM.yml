description: "Every millisecond counts: Techniques, strategies, and tools for a Web Performance Jedi Wannabe\n\nDevelopers, Designers, and Project Managers love to promise high performance for their web apps. But they know they're lying. In fact most of the websites fail from a performance point of view. In this talk I focus on every aspect and strategy that you have to consider to to fulfill the promise: performance metrics, measurements and monitoring strategy, optimization best practices, the paradox of third-party content, image rendering, browser performance tools. With one goal in mind: finding small changes that led to some of the biggest performance gains."
