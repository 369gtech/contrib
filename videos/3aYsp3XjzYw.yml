description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\n利用智能运维 (AIOps) 对云基础设施进行智能分析 | Intelligent Analysis on Cloud Infrastructure With AIOps - Ethan Gao, Intel & Pang Liye, Inspur\n\n对云本地基础设施和工作负载进行监视和观测的遥测技术是云服务的必要基础，而收集到的遥测数据大多是时间序列公式。由于海量历史/实时遥测数据的高维度和高容量，以及大规模云基础设施和分布式微服务需要通过传统方法处理，因此其效率通常较低。本课程将回顾管理/操作云基础设施和微服务的传统方式的现状和挑战，并将人工智能与转换和机器学习算法相比较，在这些遥测数据上引入人工智能，以实现云基础设施/工作负载管理和操作的更多智能，如异常检测，资源预测、故障检测、根本原因分析等。具体来说，使用 Chronos 为智能运维接入云基础设施/服务铺平道路。\n\nTelemetry with monitoring and observability to cloud native infrastructure and workloads is the essential foundation for cloud services, and those telemetry data collected is mostly in time series formulation. It's often low efficient due to high dimension and high volume of tremendous historical/real-time telemetry data with large-scale cloud infrastructure and distributed microservices to be processed by traditional methods.This session will review the current status and challenges of traditional ways to manage/operate the cloud infrastructure and microservices, and comparingly introducing AI on those telemetry data with transformation and ML algorithms to enable more intelligence on cloud infrastructure/workloads management and operation, such as anomaly detection, resource forecasting, failure detection, root-cause analysis and so on. Specifically, using the Chronos to pave the way to land the AIOps to cloud infrastructure/services."
