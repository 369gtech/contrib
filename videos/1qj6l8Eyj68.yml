description: ".NET Summit 2020 Online Edition https://dotnetsummit.by - the 4th community driven .NET conference dedicated to practical experience of solving business challenges with .NET and technical challenges in .NET application.\n\nAlexey Golub, Fallacies of Unit Testing [EN]\n\nAs we've learned software development, we were taught about the principles of maintainable code and how automated testing is inherent to consistent deliverability. We all know about the design patterns that allows us to split our applications into logical modules that can be tested independently. But is that what we really want? \nIn modern world of software development, the terms \"automated testing\" and \"unit testing\" are practically synonymous to the point where people often use them interchangeably. Acronym-riddled mantras like TDD and the clean code best practices really pushed the ideas of software design to the extreme. In this talk, we will challenge those ideas one more time and re-evaluate them in terms of value and efficiency in the context of modern tools and technologies.\n\nGeneral Partner - ISsoft - https://issoft.by"
