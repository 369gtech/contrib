Sometimes they have databases with little or no DBA support. Learn some basic skills for maintaining MySQL databases. The same skills will help balance roles between sysadmin and DBA.\r\n\r\nMySQL is ubiquitous and will be for many years. A little knowledge will go a long way to having a good MySQL setup. Sysadmins can leverage their command line skills when interacting with MySQL.\r\n\r\nThe presentation will cover *NIX and MySQL changes for good practices. Those skills will help sysadmins use and administer MySQL without needing to become a DBA.\r\n\r\nTopics:\r\n  \r\n* leveraging shell skills for MySQL\r\n* shell environment for MySQL\r\n* authentication\r\n* custom MySQL prompts\r\n* MySQL backups and restorals\r\n* choosing a database engine\r\n* MySQL logs\r\n* monitoring\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it.
