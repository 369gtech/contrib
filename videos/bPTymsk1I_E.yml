description: "What do a flock of starlings, a colony of warrior ants, and a hundred-person flash mob all have in common with the red team? Swarm intelligence, the collective behavior of individuals acting autonomously, is a concept that we can apply to human systems to unlock their potential. Swarming methodologies teach a group of individuals what to do, where to go, and how to operate as a team.\n\nNancy Eckert (Pongolyn) explores swarm intelligence through augmented reality gaming, where\nshe leads teams of agents in capture-the-flag style competitions across the world. She shows how to apply social engineering strategies to groups of individuals, with the goal of achieving a collective intelligence that is greater than the sum of its parts."
