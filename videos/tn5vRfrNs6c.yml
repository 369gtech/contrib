An amazing weekend on APRIL 29-30, 2017 – MALLORCA, SPAIN will take you out of the office into a seaside event full of professional lectures, technical sessions, beach games, umbrella drinks, and wonderful sunset. #buildstuffes #beachconference #code www.buildstuff.es\n\nIn her role as CIO at the well-known Dutch insurance company Klaverblad Verzekeringen, Kim van Wilgen is responsible for all software development and operations. Although a nerd at heart, she also has over a decade of experience in product development and comparable managerial roles on the other side: the business. She can still speak just enough of the language of the product owners and the users to understand the gap we quite frequently need to bridge. Kim van Wilgen is passionate about topics such as agile, Kanban, DevOps and continuous delivery. and the management of the cultural, organizational, team and technological changes associated with these approaches."
