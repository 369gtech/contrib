description: "Abstract:\nIn this talk, we'll go through the creation of gatsby-plugin-react-native-web, to more advanced cross-platform experiments I run on my static blog and my personal mobile app.\n\nWe'll use technologies like Gatsby, MDX, React-Native-Web, Expo, React-Navigation, Netlify, and see how all these tools can enable CI automated cross-platform content authoring solutions."
