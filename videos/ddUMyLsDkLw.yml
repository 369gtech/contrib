description: "Microservices are a popular architectural pattern in the Java world. So developers have to learn to deal with this architecture and the accompanying benefits and pitfalls. Take testing microservices. One of the main benefits of a microservice is that it has its own isolated responsibility. You can develop, upgrade, scale and test them independently. But microservices often depend on other services.\n\nSo when you want to test the application, the question arises: which services you should start.\n\nHow do you stabilise tests for a single service without bothering about its dependencies?\n\nWiremock can help you with that. WireMock is a simulator for HTTP-based APIs. In this session the use of Wiremock in a real-life application is discussed and demonstrated.\n\nRosanne is a Software Engineer at OpenValue. She came the long way around in the IT field with her bachelors degree in Psychology. She works for top companies in the Netherlands always questioning the way things are done. Rosanne codes in the language that is required, which she is glad to learn when necessary. She also likes puzzles, meditating and yoga."
