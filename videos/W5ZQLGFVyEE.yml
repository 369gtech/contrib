description: "co-log: Composable Contravariant Comonadic Logging Component\n\nIn this talk I'm going to share key design decisions behind Haskell logging library called co-log.\n\nThis library combines multiple algebraic concepts in order to provide convenient and composable solution for the logging problem:\n\nSemigroup and Monoid\nContravariant/Divisible/Decidable\nComonads\nI'm also going to show how we use this library in commercial Haskell projects.\n\nHaskell Adept, Functional Programming enthusiast. I like to discover elegant solutions for sophisticated software problems by squeezing maximum from the Haskell programming language. I enjoy discussions about programming languages design. I have experience in full-stack web-applications development with Haskell, Elm and PostgreSQL. Also, I was teaching Haskell to the students at the ITMO University.\n\nI'm a co-founder of the Kowainik organisation where I do my open-source work and mentor people.\n\nFor more on YOW!
