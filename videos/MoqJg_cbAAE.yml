title: 'Beyond the Java ecosystem â€“ integrating platforms and languages (Tamas Rozman, Hungary)'
recordingDate: 1528193080
description: 'Our core infrastructure is based on Java for scale, speed & robustness, yet other languages are better fit for specific business purposes. We use Python for data science, JavaScript for web and services. In this talk we will go through the building of a Java framework that allows management and execution of Python scripts (and plans are to include other languages in the future). The goal of this setup is to enable data and machine learning researchers to scale and to reduce the time needed for researcher models to reach the production environment, while keeping the robustness, supportability and monitorability of our infrastructure.'
