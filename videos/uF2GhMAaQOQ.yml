description: "\"Getting Your Data Joie De Vivre Back!\n[EuroPython 2019 - Keynote - 2019-07-10 - MongoDB  [PyData track]\n[Basel, CH]\n\nBy Lynn Cherny\n\nMost of us work too much and play too little.\_ When was the last time you smiled at something you made?\_ Playing with fun datasets, especially big data sets, opens up weird new forms of technical recreation.\_ Why not train an amusing model in a browser tab while you're waiting for that day-job Spark query to finish?\_ I'll show you some data toys I've built using AI and interesting data sets: Most of them involve both backend data science and front-end visualization tricks.\_ They range from poetry-composition helpers to game log analysis to image deconstruction and reconstruction. All of them taught me something, often about myself and what I like artistically, and sometimes about what \"\"big data\"\" actually means.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2019.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/"
