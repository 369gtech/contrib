title: 'Groovy integration testing with Spock and Docker'
recordingDate: 1501170305
description: 'The rise of container technologies allows us to fundamentally change the way we develop, test and deploy software. Thanks to tools like Docker, spinning up a full-fledged relational database isn’t more difficult or time consuming than using an in-memory database anymore. So why not run your integration tests on your local machine, inside an environment which resembles production as close as possible?This talk demonstrates how to use Docker in conjunction with Spock by providing live demos and best-practices for joyful integration testing. You will see how to spin-up and tear-down databases (relational and NoSQL), web-servers and even external applications on a test-class and test-method basis. In the end we’ll even have an outlook on functional testing using GEB and docker-compose with Spock.Attendees should have basic knowledge about Spock and Docker'
