description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nDiscussion & Comments: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2019\n—\nWhat do robot motion planning, hardware design and verification, software\nverification, model checking, cryptanalysis and bioinformatics have\nin common? All of them often rely on SAT solvers to do the heavy lifting.\nThis talk will show you how to solve your own problems with SAT solvers\nand leverage the decades of research that has gone into making modern SAT\nsolvers fast.\n\nWe will take a look at what the boolean satisfiability (SAT) problem means,\nand what kind of problems can be converted into SAT. We will then go over\nexamples to show how real-world problems are expressed as SAT, starting\nwith simple examples and ending with a real world problem my employer has\nbeen working on the last few years.\n\nWe will also cover why SAT solvers should be especially interesting to C++\ndevelopers, how to effectively drive a SAT solver using C++, how we can\ntransfer domain-specific knowledge to the solver and which factors\ncorrelate with being able to solve problems quickly.\n— \nMartin Hořeňovský\nLocksley.CZ\nResearcher\n\nMartin Hořeňovský is currently a researcher at Locksley.CZ, where he\nworks on converting large master-key systems to SAT. He has taught\nmodern C++ at Czech Technical University in Prague, and maintains Catch2,\na popular C++ unit testing framework, in the little free time he has left.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
