When it comes to API mocking, we tend to either stub a request client or replace it with a mocked counterpart entirely. What we’re doing is altering the tested system so it makes requests to a different source, or doesn’t make them at all. That’s mainly because there was no better option. Until now.\nIn this talk, we’ll go through how to efficiently use API mocking that retains the integrity of your JavaScript application and results in more confident tests. On top of that, I’ll illustrate how to reuse the same mocks on different testing levels, as well as during development and debugging. All that with a single tool in your arsenal.\n\n\nThis event would not take place without the support of sponsors:\n\nPlatinum Sponsors\nSauce Labs → https://saucelabs.com/\n\nGold Sponsors\nStackHawk → https://www.stackhawk.com/\nNeuralegion → https://www.neuralegion.com/\n\nSilver Sponsor\nTestim → https://www.testim.io/\n\nProduction Partner\nFocus Reactive → https://focusreactive.com/"
