description: "At this workshop/talk we will start from the basics and come shortly to DynamicProxies, DynamicObjectAdapter and DynamicStaticProxies at runtime, ProxyComposite and more. How we could combine this with invoke dynamic or maybe with an other language like kotlin? We will have a deep dive to this pattern group , and I am sure you will like it ;-) \nThis workshop is based on the german book \"Dynamic Proxies\" written from Dr. Heinz Kabutz and me."
