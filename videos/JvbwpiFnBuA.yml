description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nBuilding a Portable Kubernetes Deployment Pipeline with Argo Workflows and Events - Thomas Meadows, Jetstack & Ollie Young, Improbable\n\nIn this session, Jetstack and Improbable will uncover the key learnings from building a Kubernetes based platform, driven by Argo workflows and events. Featuring discussion on the platform's strong data aggregation and the ability to deploy on any estate (including air-gapped facilities), this session will investigate the problems and benefits of using Argo and Kubernetes as the key ingredients towards the goal of a holistic approach to portable platforms. The technical content of the presentation will cover: - A general overview of why Argo Workflows and Events were selected - Best practice when building a cloud native platform to work across multi-cloud environments - Rationale for rejecting the typical CI/CD model in favour of a custom solution - Techniques for isolating workflows in multi-tenanted environments - Running Terraform in Argo - Ephemeral environments and managing highly scalable cluster configurations - Platform portability and being infrastructure agnostic"
