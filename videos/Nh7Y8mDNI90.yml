description: "Discover Financial Services is on a journey to cloud-native architecture to reap the benefits of speed, flexibility, and scale that it promises. However, transforming a massive 30 year old financial institution to a modern software development company is no easy feat.\n\nDean Parke, Director of Digital Engineering at Discover and Mike Koleno, CTO at Solstice, will discuss this journey. Dean will share how the Discover team reached internal consensus to commit to a microservices architecture using Spring Boot; why they are moving to agile XP; and how they are tactically executing a multi-year plan of replatforming and modernization.\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/discovers-journey-to-cloud-native\n\nDean Parke, Director of Digital Engineering, Discover Financial Services\nMike Koleno, VP, Technology, Solstice\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2017"
