title: 'Whats new with Data Storage? by Richard Bogdan, Bitrise EN'
language: English
recordingDate: 1592403178
description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2020 by Richard Bogdan, Bitrise.\n\nMore info: https://android-makers-2020.firebaseapp.com/schedule/?sessionId=186387\n\nGoogle introduced the idea of Scoped Storage to further increase the security of application storage usage. Scoped Storage was planned to be implemented in Android 10, but it caused great noise in the developer community, so it has been postponed. Now with Android 11 on the sight, it looks like Scoped Storage is happening for real. Within my talk I will briefly introduce Scoped Storage to the audience, describe some challenges with the migration to it, and share my thoughts how could we do it in a pain free way."
