Smart phones and tablets not only contain more computing power and better browsers than the computers that started the Internet economy, they have better displays. In this webcast session presented by Christopher Schmitt, we will work through tips and tricks to develop future friendly images in our sites and apps.\n\nAbout Christopher Schmitt\n\nChristopher Schmitt is the founder of Heat Vision, a small new media publishing and design firm, based in Cincinnati, OH.
