recordingDate: 1586030688
description: "Connections are a part of us, of the world. From the connections between people, between cultures, within language, and more. In these days when more data is collected daily than we could ever hope to explore, the variety in connections being gathered is opening up the possibility to visualize these (often complex) networks.\n\n\nDuring this talk, Nadieh will take you through the design process of several of her (interactive) data visualization works, from personal projects to client work. The common thread they all share; they all reveal connections, but all differently. From a family tree of 3000 people connected to the European Royal houses, to those existing between our Intangible Cultural Heritage created for UNESCO, to connections we have drawn in the night skies and more.\n\n\nEVENT:\nfircevents 2019\n\n\nSPEAKER:\nNadieh Bremer\n\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nConference Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\n\nSave 10% off any FITC event with discount code 'youtube'.\nSee our upcoming events at: https://fitc.ca/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=video-description"
