description: "Elliotte Harold, SWE, Google\n\nYou’ve been bitten by the testing bug and are thoroughly test-infected. Excellent! You’re undoubtedly producing more-robust, less-buggy software faster and at lower cost. Now it’s time to think about what makes unit tests even better. This session discusses flakiness, debuggability, reproducibility, speed, specificity, and other characteristics of effective unit tests. Examples are in Java and JUnit, but the principles apply generally to all languages and test frameworks."
