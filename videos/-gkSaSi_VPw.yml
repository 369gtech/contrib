description: "Times Square is (at least before the Coronavirus...) the most visited place globally with about 380,000 pedestrian visitors a day - roughly the same amount of people which go to Wix’s dashboard.\n\nBuilding a page which receives such high traffic requires having great performance and intelligent architecture.\n\nIn this talk, Eyal goes over the challenges of rebuilding Wix’s dashboard, the architecture and how we got it to load under 1 second."
