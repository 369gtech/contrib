title: 'Polyglot Actor Model on Flink Stateful Functions'
recordingDate: 1635787803
description: 'Brief intro to flink stateful functions and the actor model and how they compare in terms of what guarantees they provide, development experience, and operation complexity. We will go over a few examples of the actor model, why it is useful, when to use it, and how it''s used in the industry. Afterwards we''ll go over how to use stateful functions to solve the same problem and compare pros and cons of each approach and when to use each. Lastly, we''ll go over the usecase for stateful functions at Bluechip and how we benefit from it.'
