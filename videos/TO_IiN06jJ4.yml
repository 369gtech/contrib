title: 'Netflix Data Mesh: Composable Data Processing - Justin Cunningham'
recordingDate: 1588067279
description: 'Netflix processes trillions of events and petabytes of data a day in the Keystone data pipeline, which is built on top of Apache Flink. As Netflix has scaled up original productions annually enjoyed by more than 150 million global members, data integration across the streaming service and the studio has become a priority. Scalably integrating data across hundreds of different data stores in a way that enables us to holistically optimize cost, performance and operational concerns presented a significant challenge. Learn how we expanded the scope of the Keystone pipeline into the Netflix Data Mesh, our real-time, general-purpose, data transportation platform for moving data between Netflix systems. The Keystone Platformâ€™s unique approach to declarative configuration and schema evolution, as well as our approach to unifying batch and streaming data and processing will be covered in depth.'
