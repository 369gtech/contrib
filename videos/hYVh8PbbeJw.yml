description: "SOD Microservices - Daniel Jones, EngineerBetter\n\nIn the clamour to deploy all the things as microservices, the development community seems to have forgotten about Service-Oriented Design - an architectural code style that allows systems to start as monoliths, and be easily broken into microservices only when required. We’ll look at what exactly Service-Oriented Design is, how to apply Service-Oriented Design in Java Spring apps, and discuss how a forward-looking monolith-first approach can save engineering time and effort.\n\nAbout Daniel Jones\nDaniel Jones is CTO of UK Cloud Foundry consultancy EngineerBetter, who have been improving value-delivery at the world’s largest banks, global wealth management firms, FTSE 100 retailers, governments and non-profit organizations. Previously Daniel was a member of the Pivotal CF London Services team, and also worked with Europe's leading CF consultancy CloudCredo. Daniel has delivered keynotes and talks at three Cloud Foundry Summits, the London PaaS User Group, as well as numerous video games industry conferences. He once even stormed the stage at a music festival to interrupt the performing act and challenge their alleged bribe-taking!"
