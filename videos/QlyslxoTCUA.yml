description: "Manage Distributed Secrets in Applications on Cloud Foundry With Spring Cloud Vault - Andreas Falk, NovaTec Consulting GmbH\n\nRunning multiple instances of spring boot based microservices on CloudFoundry is widely adopted these days. But what about your secrets? Do you spread all values using application local property files? Do you still store secrets in clear text? In case you are encrypting passwords where do you store the key to decrypt these? Do you already rotate database credentials regularly? In this session you will learn how to externalize your configuration and store your secrets safely using the recently released Spring Cloud Vault project. After a general introduction into Vault, Andreas will show how spring cloud vault facilitates the integration of vault into your application running on CloudFoundry platform. After this session you will be well prepared using externalized configuration and storing any secrets in a secure way.\n\nAbout Andreas Falk\nAndreas Falk (@andifalk) has been working in enterprise application development projects for more than twenty years.
