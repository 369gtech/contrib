Hard to understand what gets installed based on Operators etc. - Ability for operations automation at an application level in a reusable form - Dependency management for both multiple applications and components within one application  Plus, we will explore the community within scope of sig-app-delivery and share the existing efforts and trends in the community. \n\nhttps://sched.co/cpGG"
