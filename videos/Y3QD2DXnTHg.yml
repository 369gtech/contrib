title: 'SREcon19 Asia/Pacific - NetRadar: Monitoring the Datacenter Network'
language: English
recordingDate: 1563562531
description: "Yun Chen, Baidu\n\nThe quality of a datacenter network directly affects the stability and performance of production systems. A network outage can happen on various devices and influence different scope. The SRE needs to quickly identify the scope of the outage to determine the remediation actions.\n\nAt Baidu, we built NetRadar, a datacenter monitoring system, for this purpose. NetRadar applies multi-dimensional analysis algorithm on various kinds of network quality data to identify the scope of the network outages. In this talk, we will introduce our consideration in designing the monitoring system, as well as the analysis algorithm.\n\nView the full SREcon19 Asia/Pacific program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon19asia/program.\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
