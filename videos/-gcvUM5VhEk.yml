description: "Making Tax Digital: Transforming the Culture and Code of HMRC’s Tax Services\n\nAntony Collard, Deputy Director, Digital Delivery, HM Revenue and Customs\nLyndsay Prewer, Delivery Lead, Equal Experts\n\nThis is the story of HMRC’s digital transformation. Our starting point was a fifteen year legacy of outsourced IT, dominated by costly contracts, project plans and long release cycles. Three years into our transformation, HMRC is delivering digital tax services that cater for the UK’s largest tax events, serving up to five million business users and up to forty million personal users. \n\nFrom the outset we’ve applied Continuous Delivery and DevOps principles that enable our teams to perform multiple releases per day. This is hand-in-hand with a you build it, you run it ethos to ensure that each team maintains responsibility for live service performance. \n\nIn this session, you’ll hear our story so far and learn about the approaches we took to making this transformation a success.\n\nDOES16 London\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/eur/"
