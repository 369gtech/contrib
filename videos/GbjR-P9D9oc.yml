description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nSponsored Session: Dynatrace - Batteries included: Shipping OpenTelemetry with your Open Source Project \n\nEveryone agrees that for today’s highly dynamic and complex systems, observability is key.  Building observability into your work - especially if it is a library or framework to be used by many - should be on your to-do list for 2020. OpenTelemetry, a CNCF project that aims to create a vendor agnostic telemetry platform, is just the perfect fit for such use-cases and at Dynatrace we built in OpenTelemetry into one of our OpenSource projects: Keptn.sh.  In this session, we will show you how he used OpenTelemetry to make Keptn observable while staying completely agnostic to which monitoring backend might later be used. \n\nhttps://sched.co/fezu"
