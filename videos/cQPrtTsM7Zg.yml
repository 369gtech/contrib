title: 'IncludeOS - running C++ applications without an operating system - Per Buer'
recordingDate: 1539090263
description: "IncludeOS is a library operating system. The functionality you'd expect from an operating system is available as library calls. When your application builds the operating system functionality is linked into your application and a boot loader is added - giving you a standalone binary that can run on a hypervisor or on bare metal.\nThe upshot is increased performance, security and a much smaller footprint. Configuration and updates are handled differently compared to a traditional operating system.\n\nThe presentation will include a demonstration where we go through a minimal operating system and show how a running application can be updated without downtime.\n\nIncludeOS is written in modern C++ and has production deployments.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences \nhttps://ndctechtown.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
