description: "Wasn’t Java 8 a fantastic update to the language? Lambdas and streams were a huge change and have helped to improve Java developers’ productivity and introduce some functional ideas to the language.\n\nThen came Java 9… and although the module system is really interesting for certain types of applications, the lack of exciting language features and uncertainty around how painful it might be to migrate to Java 9 left many applications taking a wait-and-see approach, happy with Java 8.\n\nBut now Java has a new version every six months, and suddenly Java 12 is here. We’re all still on Java 8, wondering whether we should move to a later version, which one to choose, and how painful it might be to upgrade.\n\nIn this session we’ll look at:\n\nWhy upgrade from Java 8, including language features from Java 9, 10, 11 and 12\nWhat sorts of issues might we run into if we do choose to upgrade\nHow the support and license changes that came in with Java 11 might impact us."
