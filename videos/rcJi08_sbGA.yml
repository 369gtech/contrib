Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nTo Infinite Scale and Beyond: Operating Kubernetes Past the Steady State - Austin Lamon, Spotify & Jago Macleod, Google \n\nOperating large distributed systems at significant scale is challenging. Most discussions focus on scalability either at a single point in time under sustained load, or explore challenges related to changes in incoming traffic.   But running distributed systems at scale is about more than steady states and transitions between them. What is equally challenging and tends to get overlooked are the operational challenges of running at scale: upgrading many and/or large clusters; deploying applications to and across multiple clusters in a reasonable way; balancing freedom and consistency across multiple teams. In this case study, Google and Spotify share some of the challenges of running Kubernetes at Scale, together with concrete solutions, patterns, and common pitfalls we have found together. Intended for cluster operators and developers from organizations of any size and on any provider. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UaYk"
