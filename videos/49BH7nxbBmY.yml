We are excited to bring the power and productivity of the Dart platform to the server. In this session you will see how to build a Dart application that spans the server and the browser, debug the application on mobile, and deploy to the recently announced Managed VMs on Google Cloud. You will learn how to structure an application for maximum code reuse, easy maintenance, and fast turn-around.\n\nWatch all Google I/O 2014 videos at: g.co/io14videos"
