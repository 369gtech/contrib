description: "In a startup, the growing pains that you go through seem like they are unique to your situation. But, they are not. Every startup goes through the same growing pains, and the key is to understand in the moment you are there, and how to deal with each situation. I have started over 15 companies in the past 10 years and sold my last one. This talk goes through some of the common startup pains so you know you are not alone, and how to think about some of the issues you may be experiencing.\n\nEVENT:\n\nJazoon TechDays 2017\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nTracy Lee\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nJazoon TechDays Conference Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permissions to republish this talk."
