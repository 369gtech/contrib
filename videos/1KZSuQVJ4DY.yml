description: "In this talk I dig into the Elixir language—a functional language, inspired in part by the philosophy of Ruby, that runs on the Erlang VM. This isn’t a sales pitch for Elixir—there are dozens of great languages out there. Instead, I want to talk about how learning Elixir has changed the way I think about programming. And I want to encourage you to invest in your futures by developing new vocabularies and new reflexes.\n\nMy goal? To save your career and make your life interesting. :)\n\nDave Thomas is a cornerstone of the Ruby community, and is personally responsible for many of its innovative directions and initiatives. Dave is a programmer, and now he is an accidental publisher. He wrote The Pragmatic Programmer with Andy Hunt at the end of the ’90s, and that experience opened a new world for them. They discovered a love of writing that complemented their love of learning new things. Dave is one of the authors of the Agile Manifesto, and he is probably responsible for bringing Ruby to attention of Western developers with the book Programming Ruby. He was one of the first adopters of Rails, and helped spread the word with the book Agile Web Development with Rails. He enjoys speaking at conferences, running public and private training. But most of all, he loves coding.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
