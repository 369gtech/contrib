description: "Performance of a VM vs. Containerized Cloud Foundry - Vlad Iovanov & Jeff Hobbs, SUSE\n\nOne of the most asked questions about the new containerized Cloud Foundry is how it compares to a VM-based installation in terms of performance.\n\nIn this talk we will discuss the architecture design for containerization of CF, going beyond making containers to make it Kubernetes aware. We will compare a \"Kubernetes-native\" Cloud Foundry against a \"traditional\" BOSH OpenStack VM-based installation. We’ll present numbers to compare how these perform in operation.\n\nThe presenter will show the techniques used in these experiments and discuss the comparison between the two styles of deploying Cloud Foundry.\n\nWe'll explain our testing methodology and go through the results.\n\nThis will include installation/upgrade duration, application start-up and scaling duration, application latency and routing performance.\n\nhttps://cfseu18.sched.com/event/FRyi/performance-of-a-vm-vs-containerized-cloud-foundry-vlad-iovanov-jeff-hobbs-suse"
