description: "It wouldn’t be an official programming video series if we didn’t do “Hello, world!” We won’t go against tradition, and walkthrough the classic demo, World. We will also see how the different files interact, and how to create our first route in Django to route user requests to our code.\n\nUseful Links:\nhttps://aka.ms/CreateWebsitesWithDjango\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/beginners-django"
