description: "This course will teach you how to use Keras, a neural network API written in Python and integrated with TensorFlow. We will learn how to prepare and process data for artificial neural networks, build and train artificial neural networks from scratch, build and train convolutional neural networks (CNNs), implement fine-tuning and transfer learning, and more!\n\n⭐️🦎 COURSE CONTENTS 🦎⭐️\n⌨️ (00:00:00) Welcome to this course\n⌨️ (00:00:16) Keras Course Introduction\n⌨️ (00:00:50) Course Prerequisites\n⌨️ (00:01:33) DEEPLIZARD Deep Learning Path\n⌨️ (00:01:45) Course Resources\n⌨️ (00:02:30) About Keras\n⌨️ (00:06:41) Keras with TensorFlow - Data Processing for Neural Network Training\n⌨️ (00:18:39) Create an Artificial Neural Network with TensorFlow's Keras API\n⌨️ (00:24:36) Train an Artificial Neural Network with TensorFlow's Keras API\n⌨️ (00:30:07) Build a Validation Set With TensorFlow's Keras API\n⌨️ (00:39:28) Neural Network Predictions with TensorFlow's Keras API\n⌨️ (00:47:48) Create a Confusion Matrix for Neural Network Predictions\n⌨️ (00:52:29) Save and Load a Model with TensorFlow's Keras API\n⌨️ (01:01:25) Image Preparation for CNNs with TensorFlow's Keras API\n⌨️ (01:19:22) Build and Train a CNN with TensorFlow's Keras API\n⌨️ (01:28:42) CNN Predictions with TensorFlow's Keras API\n⌨️ (01:37:05) Build a Fine-Tuned Neural Network with TensorFlow's Keras API\n⌨️ (01:48:19) Train a Fine-Tuned Neural Network with TensorFlow's Keras API\n⌨️ (01:52:39) Predict with a Fine-Tuned Neural Network with TensorFlow's Keras API\n⌨️ (01:57:50) MobileNet Image Classification with TensorFlow's Keras API\n⌨️ (02:11:18) Process Images for Fine-Tuned MobileNet with TensorFlow's Keras API\n⌨️ (02:24:24) Fine-Tuning MobileNet on Custom Data Set with TensorFlow's Keras API\n⌨️ (02:38:59) Data Augmentation with TensorFlow' Keras API\n⌨️ (02:47:24) Collective Intelligence and the DEEPLIZARD HIVEMIND\n\n⭐️🦎 DEEPLIZARD COMMUNITY RESOURCES 🦎⭐️\n   \n👉 Check out the blog post and other resources for this course:\n🔗 https://deeplizard.com/learn/video/RznKVRTFkBY\n\n💻 DOWNLOAD ACCESS TO CODE FILES\n🤖 Available for members of the deeplizard hivemind:\n🔗 https://deeplizard.com/resources\n\n🧠 Support collective intelligence, join the deeplizard hivemind:\n🔗 https://deeplizard.com/hivemind\n\n👋 Hey, we're Chris and Mandy, the creators of deeplizard!\n👀 CHECK OUT OUR VLOG:\n🔗 https://youtube.com/deeplizardvlog\n\n👀 Follow deeplizard:\nYouTube: https://youtube.com/deeplizard\nOur vlog: https://youtube.com/deeplizardvlog\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/deeplizard\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/deeplizard\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/deeplizard\nPatreon: https://patreon.com/deeplizard\n\n🎵 deeplizard uses music by Kevin MacLeod\n🔗 https://youtube.com/channel/UCSZXFhRIx6b0dFX3xS8L1yQ\n🔗 http://incompetech.com/\n\n❤️ Please use the knowledge gained from deeplizard content for good, not evil.\n\n--\n\nLearn to code for free and get a developer job: https://www.freecodecamp.org\n\nRead hundreds of articles on programming: https://freecodecamp.org/news\n\nAnd subscribe for new videos on technology every day: https://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=freecodecamp"
