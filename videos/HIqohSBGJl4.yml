title: 'YOW! 2013 David Evans - Setting a Good Example â€“ How to improve your SbE, BDD and ATDD artefacts'
recordingDate: 1514386397
description: "To get the most out of Behaviour Driven Development (BDD), Specification by Example (SBE) or Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD), you need much more than a tool. You need high value specifications. How do we get the most out of our specification and test writing effort? How do we write testable scenarios that business people will actually care about? These and other questions will be addressed in this talk in which we take a practical approach using real-world examples.\n\nIf you work with Cucumber, Concordion, Fitnesse or similar tools to support BDD and ATDD, you will learn how to avoid common mistakes that teams make when writing test scenarios. You will also learn to recognise the characteristics that take good scenario descriptions beyond the role of acceptance tests and into living documentation for long-term value.\n\nDavid Evans, together with Gojko Adzic have educated hundreds of analysts, developers and testers in the best practices of Specification by Example (SBE).\n\nDavid Evans is an experienced agile consultant, coach and trainer with over 25 years of IT experience. A thought-leader in the field of agile testing, he has provided training and consultancy for clients in the UK, USA, Ireland, Sweden, Germany, France, Australia, Israel, South Africa and Singapore. A regular speaker at events and conferences across Europe, David has also had several papers published in international IT journals. He currently lives and works in the UK, where he is a partner along with Gojko Adzic in Neuri Consulting LLP. He can be reached at david.evans@neuri.co.uk on email and @DavidEvans66 on Twitter.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
