recordingDate: 1603796404
description: 'Real-time streaming applications in financial systems typically demand low-latency guarantee at very high throughput i.e. of the order of million transactions per second. If the business use case requires stateful processing, enrichment and accuracy then scaling out becomes an interesting challenge. At this scale how to manage state efficiently, how to make enrichments faster, find bottlenecks and scale out? We will share the design choices considered, trade-offs applied and bottlenecks faced along the journey of scaling. Contents of the talk are applicable across wider business domains and use-cases beyond financial services.'
