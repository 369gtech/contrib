description: "Debugging Applications on Kubernetes - Michelle Noorali & Radu Matei, Microsoft \n\nOnce upon a time, using a debugger was a normal part of development. Then along came the cloud, and suddenly, a tool developers took for granted completely disappeared. We used to have a single place like an IDE of choice to add some breakpoints, step through the code, and hopefully solve the issue.  In a distributed world where there are many moving parts that can’t always be run on a single machine, debugging an application consisting of multiple services has become significantly harder with microservices written in a variety of languages that come with their own toolchain spread across multiple teams and repositories.   In this demo-led session, we’ll discuss the current state of debugging applications in Kubernetes and provide multiple methods and solutions for debugging so that we can leverage all of the goodness of microservices and the ease of use of existing debugging workflows. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/GrRd"
