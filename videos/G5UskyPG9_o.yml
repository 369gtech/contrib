title: 'Understanding Latency and Response Time: Pitfalls and Key Lessons'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433236884
description: "Time is money. Understanding application responsiveness and latency is critical not only for delivering good application behavior but also for maintaining profitability and containing risk. But good characterization of bad data is useless. When measurements of response time present false or misleading latency information, even the best analysis can lead to wrong operational decisions and poor application experience. This session demonstrates common pitfalls encountered in measuring, describing, and reporting latency and response time behavior. It then demonstrates the use of recently open-sourced tools to improve and gain higher confidence in both latency measurement and reporting.\n\n\nAuthor:\nGil Tene\nGil Tene is CTO and co-founder of Azul Systems.
