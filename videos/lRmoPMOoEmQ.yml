description: "Kubernetes has emerged as the de-facto standard for orchestrating containerized applications. While it abstracts away many complexities, it also introduces new operational and monitoring challenges. In fact, the latest CNCF survey cites monitoring as one of the biggest challenges in Kubernetes adoption.\n\nIn this webinar, Arijit Mukherji and Maxime Petazzoni will walk through the changes in requirements for monitoring Kubernetes and service mesh environments, typical challenges that enterprises face on their journey to cloud-native and how to navigate around those challenges leveraging CNCF projects such as Prometheus, OpenTracing, and Envoy.\n\nYou will also see a demo showing the best practices in monitoring Kubernetes environments using metrics, events, and traces."
