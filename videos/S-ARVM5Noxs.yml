description: "One of my talks is a low-level talk about real-time technologies in ASP.NET Core. This is not that talk, it's rather its continuation. This talk focuses on patterns, architecture, and solving scalability problems when building real-time web applications based on ASP.NET Core stack. It aims at showing you how to design great real-time applications for both on-premise and cloud.\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
