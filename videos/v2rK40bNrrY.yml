description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Chicago 2019. #GOTOcon #GOTOchgo\nhttp://gotochgo.com\n\nDoug Lenat - Award-winning AI pioneer who created the landmark Machine Learning program, AM, in 1976 and CEO of Cycorp\n\nABSTRACT\nAlmost everyone who talks about Artificial Intelligence, nowadays, means training multi-level neural nets on big data. Developing and using those patterns is a lot like what our right brain hemispheres do; it enables AI's to react quickly and – very often – adequately. But we human beings also make good use of our left brain hemisphere, which reasons more slowly, logically, and causally.\nI will discuss this \"other type of AI\" – i.e., left brain AI, which comprises a formal representation language, a \"seed\" knowledge base with hand-engineered default rules of common sense and good domain-specific expert judgement written in that language, and an inference engine capable of producing hundreds-deep chains of deduction, induction, and abduction on that large knowledge base. I will describe the largest such platform, Cyc, and will demo a few commercial applications that were produced just by educating it as one might teach a new human employee.\nBut it is important to remember that human beings' \"super-power\" is our ability to harness both types of reasoning, and I believe that the most powerful AI solutions in the coming decade will likewise be hybrids of right-brain-like \"thinking fast\" and left-brain-like \"thinking slow\". That is the only path I see by which we will overcome the current dangerous inability of deep-learning AI's to rationalize and explain their decisions, and will make AI's far more trusted and – more importantly – far more trustworthy.\nAnyone who understood this abstract and found it interesting should find [...]\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotochgo.com/2019/sessions/724/the-promise-and-limitations-of-ai\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOchgo\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#AI #ML #NeuralNetworks #DataScience #MachineLearning #ArtificialIntelligence\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO Conference near you!
