recordingDate: 1528198538
description: "Docker was once only for the Unix ecosystem, but now the containerised goodness is also native to Windows — well, its getting there!\n\nIn this talk, we'll take a hands-on approach to getting started with Docker running on Windows 10, including both Windows- and Linux-based containers, in order to package up your .Net Core application or service.\n\nWe'll also look at how you can expose your local development environment to the web for testing using a service called 'Argo Tunnel', by Cloudflare.\n\nAfter this talk, you'll hopefully understand the core Docker concepts and know enough to go away and start exploring Docker on Windows by yourself."
