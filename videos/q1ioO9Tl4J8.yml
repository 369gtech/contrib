description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nSimplify Your Cloud Native Application Packaging and Deployments - Chris Crone, Docker \n\nWith so many tools for declaring and deploying applications, developing cloud native apps can get complicated quickly. Single container images can be built and shared with a registry, but what about multi container or other more complex applications? Using the CNAB (Cloud Native Application Bundle) specification, open source projects like Docker App or Porter allow you to package apps that would normally require multiple tools like Terraform, Helm, and shell to deploy - into a single tooling agnostic packaging format. These packages can then be shared using existing container registries and used with other CNAB compliant tools.  In this talk, Chris Crone, co-executive director of the CNAB project, will share how to simplify cloud native development workflows using your favorite tools like Terraform, Helm and others, without requiring every developer to learn them.\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zet9"
