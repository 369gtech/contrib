description: "Do it Live: Measuring your Applications in Production - Jason Keene, Pivotal \n\nEver had a bug that only shows its head in production? Ever wanted to ask arbitrary questions about your software while it is running with minimal impact on performance? In this talk, we go beyond pre-defined instrumentation and look at various techniques of gathering information about your application to help you solve your production woes. Topics include:  - How to ask good questions, and get good answers. - Securely running a container in your cluster for probing your application. - How to use eBPF/BCC tools to gather data without impacting performance. - Techniques for using ptrace/debuggers when all else fails. - Knowing when to *not* use these tools and how to better instrument your code in advance of a production issue.  With these tools and techniques you will be better equipped to understand your software and solve the problems you'll face in production. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/GrXR"
