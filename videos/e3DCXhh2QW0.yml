recordingDate: 1549600778
description: "Dave Thomas is a programmer, and now an accidental publisher. Dave Thomas wrote The Pragmatic Programmer with Andy Hunt at the end of the '90s, and that experience opened a new world for them. They discovered a love of writing that complemented their love of learning new things.\n\nDave Thomas is one of the authors of the Agile Manifesto, and probably responsible for bringing Ruby to attention of Western developers with the book Programming Ruby. He was one of the first adopters of Rails, and helped spread the word with the book Agile Web Development with Rails.\n\nDave Thomas enjoys speaking at conferences, running public and private training. But most of all, Dave Thomas loves coding.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
