description: "When deciding how to integrate graphical effects in your web design, it's easy to see CSS and SVG as competing options. But these two tools are better together. Static SVG images created by graphics software rarely use CSS, but a little CSS code can transform those SVG files into dynamic, interactive, and responsive graphics.\n\nThis session will introduce many of the ways CSS can be used to enhance SVG. It will start by outlining how CSS for SVG is similar and different from CSS for HTML, with some practical tips to avoid common difficulties. Then we will start having some fun:\n\n- applying CSS animations and transitions to SVG properties, what works now and what should be possible soon;\n- using CSS inheritance and re-usable SVG icons to create variations on a theme, with additional potential from CSS variables;\n- designing CSS media queries for SVG to consider how they interact with SVG view-box scaling in responsive designs;\n- defining filters, masks, and clip-paths in SVG code to apply as CSS effects to HTML.\n\nIt will be a rapid overview of the (many) possibilities, not a detailed tutorial. The discussion should be accessible to SVG beginners — assuming you know a thing or two about CSS! However, it will not be a general introduction to SVG, instead focusing on how you can adapt and enhance existing SVG code.\n\nSlides: https://ameliabr.github.io/css-svg-dynamic-duo/\nAbout Amelia: https://twitter.com/ameliasbrain\n\nMore about CSS Day: http://cssday.nl or https://twitter.com/cssdayconf\nReceive conference announcements in your inbox: http://cssday.nl/subscribe"
