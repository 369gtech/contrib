description: "Robert van Molken, Blockchain Architect, AMIS\n\nBlockchain is something that’s here to stay, not just hype. How do we get started on building our own decentralized applications? This session explores how to develop decentralized apps (DApps) that can interact with smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. To achieve this, this session’s speaker combines the Ethereum platform with the Truffle framework for smart contracts. Using AMIS’ Truffle Box for Oracle JET, he shows you how to write and deploy smart contracts and use the Truffle framework to interact with these smart contracts from a DApp build in Oracle JET. The session includes a live demo and useful code snippets and very lightly touches on the general aspects of blockchain to focus on the practical knowledge needed to develop applications."
