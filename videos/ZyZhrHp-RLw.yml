title: 'microXchg 2016 - Peter Rossbach : Docker Ecosystem for Microservices'
recordingDate: 1454623540
description: 'This presentation gives an overview of the technical solutions for the orchestration of Docker based services and why it is so important for you to rethink your Microservice systems. To create, maintain and modify many machines and containers on your developer notebook, in the data center or the cloud is a challenge. Our applications are constantly being expanded and adapted to different use cases. The Docker ecosystem offers promising tools for service discovery, automatic scaling, failover and deployment. The talk presents the benefits of the tools and shows a practical Microservices system environment.'
