language: English
recordingDate: 1637444907
description: "LISA16 - Using Open Source Telemetry to Drive Change in Management Environments\n\nSusan Young, Office of the CTO, Dell EMC\n\nThis talk will discuss the different dimensions of telemetry as a means of gathering system intelligence and driving operator and automated changes in a modern data center. As part of the presentation, we will look at the role of different open source telemetry frameworks in the context of telemetry collection, processing, and publishing. The talk also looks at examples of the use of system telemetry as a data source through the lens of different problem spaces such as system automation, the Internet of Things (IoT), and machine learning.\n\nAttendees will take back knowledge of how to use open source telemetry frameworks, as well as applicable patterns, algorithms and protocols to create telemetry-based solutions that solve specific business problems. Specifically they will acquire knowledge of how to incorporate telemetry into solutions that increase the value of their infrastructure through greater automation and the creation of data streams that can be used to drive data insights.\n\nView the full LISA16 Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa16/conference-program"
