description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2018\n—\nYour actively growing library or component is inadequately tested! Good enough maintenance is nearly impossible, because you cannot run all of your clients' software for regressions. \n\nEnter Playback-Based Testing (PBT)!!\n\nRecord artifact during client live session, playback in your lab with just your library. Curate \"recordings\" from clients for automated integration testing.The benefit/cost ratio can be spectacular, as library scales. (A cost is adapting or doubling the API layer). \n\nConsider leveraging these artifacts to improve author-client collaboration.\n\nThe talk: General architecture and strategy of PBT tools described. Impactful PBT is arguably most attainable through a Grow-Your-Own effort. Since it works by exploiting data otherwise thrown away,  PBT is like a second cousin of Time Travel Debugging (TTD).\n\nSpecific experience: Having been immersed in PBT mindset (a cornerstone of Autodesk Revit's success), William's team attacked flakiness in a Revit integration of provider's cloud data storage framework -- by cobbling together a PBT tool.\n\nIntroduce C++ headers-only library (\"CppPlayer\") intended as a PBT jump-start. It is available as open source at https://github.com/WilliamClements/CppPlayer ...\n— \nWilliam Clements, Sr. Principal Engineer\nAutodesk\n\nCoding design software for almost 40 years on East coast. Accomplishments include feats of \"infrastructure\" -- graphics, data archiving, multi-threading. Principle author of a UI-based test recorder that has produced over 15,000 tests for a premier CAD application.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
