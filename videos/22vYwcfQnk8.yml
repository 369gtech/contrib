title: 'YOW! 2012 Jim Weirich - Connascence Examined'
language: English
recordingDate: 1513433971
description: "Connascence (noun) is defined as (1) the common birth of two or more at the same time; production of two or more together, (2) That which is born or produced with another, or (3) the act of growing together.\n\nIn software, we are told we should reduce the coupling between our modules so that our software is easier to maintain.  But what is coupling? Myers (in \"Composite/Structured Design\") suggests that there are seven levels of coupling, but his nomenclature is developed during the days of Structured programming and does not deal well with objects and classes.\n\nBy identifying and classifying how changes in one portion of a software program can effect other places in the program, connascence attempts to define coupling in terms of ways software can changes.  In this talk we will examine the different types of connascence and come to understand how coupling effects software development.\n\nJim Weirich first learned about computers when his college adviser suggested he take a computer science course: \"It will be useful, and you might enjoy it.\" With those prophetic words, Jim has been developing now for over 25 years, working with everything from crunching rocket launch data on supercomputers to wiring up servos and LEDs on micro-controllers. Currently he loves working in Ruby and Rails as the Chief Scientist at EdgeCase, but you can also find him strumming on his ukulele as time permits. Software Passion: Writing awesome code.
