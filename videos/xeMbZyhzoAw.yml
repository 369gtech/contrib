Dino Esposito, JetBrains — The Courage of Knowing Things (and not being a geek)\nDotext 2015 Piter: Main Russian .NET Conference\nSaint-Petersburg, 05 Jun 2015\n\nWhen a software product is no longer updated is it old? Or is it just right? Is the number of Github commits enough to measure the business relevance of a software product? In the real world, old-fashioned technologies run line-of-business applications and move the money—literally as so many banking apps are still RPG/AS400. My grandma used to say \"learn a trade and all of its tricks\". Similarly today I'd say \"learn a way to do things you need to do and do it\". Whether it's WebForms, MVC, Silverlight or even VB6, I suggest we all look for alternatives only when we're in trouble. Possibly not deadly lost in trouble, but not even at first itch. Feeling a geek gives only positive sensations; behaving like a geek, instead, only leads to troubles that only the next version can fix once the first RC of the next CTP is released to a restricted group of selected fanboys. (And yes, we'll talk ASP.NET5 and .NET Core as well...)"
