description: "The old notion of a software architect being a non-coding, post-useful deep thinker is giving way to something far more interesting, says Neal Ford. “Architecture has become much more interesting now because it’s become more encompassing … it’s trying to solve real problems rather than play with abstractions.”\n\nWatch more from the O'Reilly Software Architecture Conference: http://goo.gl/lXpXnG\n\nThe old notion of a software architect being a non-coding, post-useful deep thinker is giving way to something far more interesting, says Neal Ford. \"Architecture has become much more interesting now because it's become more encompassing ... it's trying to solve real problems rather than play with abstractions.\"\n\nFor more information, visit: http://oreil.ly/1Cyt9nt\nSoftware architecture is a massive multidisciplinary subject, covering many roles and responsibilities, which makes it challenging to teach because so much context is required for every subject. It's also a fast-moving discipline, where entire suites of best practices become obsolete overnight.\n\nThe O'Reilly Software Architecture Conference is a new event designed to provide the necessary professional training that software architects and aspiring software architects need to succeed. A unique event, it covers the full scope of a software architect's job, from IT to leadership and business skills. It also provides a forum for networking and hearing what other professionals have learned in real-world experiences.\n\nStay Connected to O'Reilly Media by Email - http://goo.gl/YZSWbO\nFollow O'Reilly Media:\nhttp://plus.google.com/+oreillymedia\nhttps://www.facebook.com/OReilly\nhttps://twitter.com/OReillyMedia"
