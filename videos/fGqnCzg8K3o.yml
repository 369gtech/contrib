description: "( Microservices Architecture Training: https://www.edureka.co/microservices-architecture-training )\nThis Edureka's video will help you understand what are microservices and their practical implementation using Spring Boot. In this video, you will learn the following:\n\n1. Monolithic Architecture\n2. Challenges Of Monolithic Architecture\n3. What are Microservices\n4. Microservice Architecture Components\n5. Hands-On Using Spring Boot\n\n#Microservices #MicroserviceArchitectureTutorial #MicroservicesForBeginners #MicroservicesOnlineTraining #MicroservicesUsingSpringBoot\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbout Microservices Architecture Training\n\nEdureka’s Microservices Architecture training introduces you to the concept of Microservices that are small, lightweight, process-driven components. So, Microservices are the next important thing in designing scalable, easy-to-maintain applications. This not only makes application development easier but also offers great flexibility and lets you utilize various resources optimally. If you want to build an enterprise-ready implementation of the \n\nMicroservices architecture, then this course is the first step for you. In this Microservices Architecture training, we will start by giving you a deep understanding of the core Microservices concepts and principle with insight in how they have evolved. We will walk you through the complete life cycle - from design to development to testing; including cross-layer concepts such as how to secure Microservices.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat are the Objectives of our Microservices Architecture Training?\n\nAfter completing, Edureka's Microservice training, you will be able to:\n\n1.Understand and differentiate between various Microservices Architectural styles\n2.Apply Microservices Architecture principles\n3.Know how to make the appropriate Microservice Architecture decision\n4.Develop and test a Microservice\n5.Know what technologies can be used to enable Microservices with an example\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhy should you go for Microservices Architecture Training?\n\nMicroservices Architecture, or simply Microservices, is a unique method of developing software systems as a suite \n\nof independently deployable, small, modular services in which each service runs a unique process and communicates \n\nthrough a well-defined, lightweight mechanism to serve a business goal. Thanks to its scalability, this \n\narchitectural method is considered ideal when you have to enable support for a range of platforms and devices \n\nspanning across the web, mobile, Internet of Things, and so on. Because of its flexibility, you can also use this \n\nmethod when you’re not sure what kind of devices you’ll need to support in an increasingly Cloud-based future.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat are the Pre-Requisites for Microservices Architecture Training ?\n\nThere are no prerequisites for attending this Microservice course. Understanding of programming languages such as \n\nJava, basic understanding and familiarity with Spring Boot framework and building  Java applications would be \n\nuseful to execute Case Study and Project.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWho should go for this Microservices Architecture Training?\n\n1.Application Architects\n2.Software Architects\n3.Application Developers\n4.Developer working on Web, Cloud, Mobile, and other social technologies\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/edurekaIN/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/edurekain\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/edureka \n\nFor more information, please write back to us at sales@edureka.co\nCall us at US: 1844 230 6361 (Toll Free) or India: +91 98702 76458"
