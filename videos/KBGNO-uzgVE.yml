description: "Philip James\n\nhttps://2018.pycon-au.org/talks/45261-all-in-the-timing-sidechannel-attacks/\n\nHere, you’ll learn about a category of security issue known as side channel attacks. You’ll be amused to see how features like automatic data compression, short-circuit execution, and deterministic hashing can be abused to bypass security systems. No security background knowledge is required.\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, australia, programming, sydney\n\nThis video is licensed under CC BY 3.0 AU ‹https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/au/›.\r\n\r\nPyCon Australia (“PyCon AU”) is the national conference for the Python Programming Community, bringing together professional, student and enthusiast developers with a love for developing with Python.\n\nPyCon AU, the national Python Language conference, is on again this August in Sydney, at the International Convention Centre, Sydney, August 24 - 28 2018.\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU"
