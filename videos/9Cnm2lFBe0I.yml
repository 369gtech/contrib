Heap dumps from production systems are often gigantic (4+ gigs) with millions of objects in memory. Simple spot checking with traditional tools is woefully inadequate in these situations, especially with real data. Leaks can be entire object graphs with enormous amounts of noise. This session will show you how to build custom tools using the Apache NetBeans Profiler/Heapwalker APIs. Using these APIs, you can read and analyze Java heaps programmatically to ask really hard questions. This gives you the power to analyze complex object graphs with tens of thousands of objects in seconds.\n\nRyan Cuprak \nFrom Dassault Systemes\nRyan Cuprak is an CPG & Retail, Formulation R&D Development Senior Manager at Dassault Systemes, co-author EJB in Action 2nd Edition from Manning and the NetBeans Certification Guide from McGrall-Hill.
