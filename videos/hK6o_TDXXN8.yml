description: "PyData London Meetup #47\nTuesday, August 14, 2018\n\nIt's been 10 years since pandas development started. In this time, pandas growth in popularity has been incredible, becoming the de-facto standard for data analysis, to the point of being responsible for 1% of StackOverflow traffic. And the development of pandas continues strong, with new features and many fixes coming at every release.\n\nIn this talk we'll start with the motivation for the project. Covering its past, the current development and latest features, and what can we expect from the project in the future.\n\nMarc (https://twitter.com/datapythonista) is a pandas core developer and Python fellow. His academic background is in AI and finance. Having worked with Python for the last 12 years, and in the data field for the last 5. He's the organiser of the London Python sprints group, and a regular speaker at PyData and PyCon conferences.\n\nSponsored & Hosted by Man AHL\n\n****\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
