description: "Rob Dolin - SENIOR PROGRAM MANAGER, Interop US RD, Microsoft\nAleksa Sarai - Senior Software Engineer, SUSE\nChris Aniszczyk - COO, CNCF\nMichael Crosby - Engineer, Docker\n\nWith the proliferation and rapid growth of container-based solutions over the past few years-- including container-based solutions from almost all major IT vendors, cloud providers and emerging start-ups-- the industry needed a standard on which to support container formats and runtime. Enter the Open Container Initiative (OCI), established to help promote a set of common, minimal open standards and specifications around container formats and runtime. OCI is working towards v1.0 of its runtime and image format specifications, to be followed by the launch of a certification program. Hear from OCI technical experts on how these new specs can be implemented in various container environments, the importance of industry standards and how the OCI is addressing those needs, and how integration and open development of these specifications furthers innovation and benefits the industry as a whole."
