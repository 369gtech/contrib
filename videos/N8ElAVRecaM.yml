description: "How do you improve efficiency, reduce latency and memory footprint of your data access? Reactive Streams on top of a functional-reactive programming model are key. Both are two predominant concepts in reactive systems, that completely change how we approach data access in applications today. Reactive data access improves resource usage efficiency and eliminates several constraints of today’s imperative approaches.\n\nThis talk covers non-blocking data access using Spring Data for NoSQl data stores and Project Reactor. You will learn how to integrate Spring Data repositories in an end-to-end reactive web application. If you are a developer looking to consume data in a functional reactive style, this is your chance to gain the experience how your application can benefit from streaming data access.\n\n\nChristoph Strobl, Software Engineer, Pivotal\nMark Paluch, Spring Data Engineer, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2017"
