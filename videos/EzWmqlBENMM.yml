title: 'YOW! 2015 - Dan North - Delivery Mapping: Turning the Lights On'
recordingDate: 1451993771
description: "It seems the hot topic of the moment is how to “solve” agile delivery at scale. Whether it be the heavyweights of SAFe, DAD and LeSS, or upstarts like Reliable Scrum, the pitch is the same: Our solution, along with its associated consulting and certification, is the Ultimate Answer.\n\nAs Deep Thought explains in The Hitchhikers’ Guide to the Galaxy: “I think the problem, to be quite honest with you, is that you’ve never actually known what the question is.”\n\nDifferent organisations have different needs, challenges and expectations, so Dan thinks the first step on any scaling journey is to get a sense of where you really are. He proposes a three stage approach which starts with turning on the lights to see what’s hiding in the dark. This is often trickier than it looks, and involves tigers, dragons and wild-assed guesses.\n\nCome along and learn new buzzwords like Demand Mapping and Skills Liquidity, and maybe learn why it is dangerous to start with the solution already in mind.\n\nDan North uses his deep technical and organisational knowledge to help CIOs, business and software teams to deliver quickly and successfully. He puts people first and finds simple, pragmatic solutions to business and technical problems, often using lean and agile techniques. With over twenty years of experience in IT, Dan is a frequent speaker at technology conferences worldwide. The originator of Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD) and Deliberate Discovery, Dan has published feature articles in numerous software and business publications, and contributed to The RSpec Book: Behaviour Driven Development with RSpec, Cucumber, and Friends and 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know: Collective Wisdom from the Experts. He occasionally blogs at http://dannorth.net/blog.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
