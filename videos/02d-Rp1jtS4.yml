description: "Speaker: Christina Teo\n\nChristina is the founder of Startup Asia Women. Returning to Singapore last year, she transitioned from a high profile corporate career to working with startups, building a community. She had held many pioneering roles in large corporates, almost like a startup in an enterprise with the same challenges of any self-starter. Every role she held at Acer, IBM, DEC, 3Com, O2, CSL are roles she had no prior experience for. Always a self starter, she prides having rode on multiple technology breakthroughs from PC to broadband to dotcom to mobile data. She has worked and lived in Europe, Asia, New York and is global market and cultural savvy.\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/christinateo/\n\nEvent Page: https://facebook.com/startupasiawomen\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/bA1H/"
