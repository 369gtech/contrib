title: 'GeeCON 2019: Bartłomiej Kuczyński - Monolith? Microservices? Who cares?'
recordingDate: 1564046030
description: 'Conversations about architecture can now be summarized in simple words - you start a project, do microservices. The question is, is this a good approach? Is each problem to be solved using the ''cloud application in microservice architecture''? Of course not! So why are we doing this? Is there a different approach to the problem? Do classic monoliths make sense? During the lecture, we will discuss this topic. We will dismantle the first few classic applications and problems in monolithic systems. We will look at how to create programs and, at the same time, not drown in service bills.'
