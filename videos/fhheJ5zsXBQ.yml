description: "This video was recorded at the virtual Code BEAM V Europe conference, which took place on 19-21st May 2021 - https://codesync.global/conferences/code-beam-sto-2021/\n\nMore great virtual tech conferences - https://codesync.globalâ€‹ \n\n---\n\nAtlas  Flexible Software Composition using Protocols \nby Quinn Wilton\n\n\nABSTRACT\nLast year, my team delivered an application that aggregated data from multiple remote services, and we produced it in a third of the time allocated.\n\nTo facilitate this pace of development, I modeled our services using Norm, composed those models using protocols, and then used property testing to verify them against the real services: enabling us to concurrently develop the frontend, backend, and upstream services.\n\nI'll explore these patterns through an example application that demonstrates them in action.\n\n---\n\nSPEAKER - Quinn Wilton\nQuinn is a senior architect at Synopsys, where her team uses Elixir to build automated security scanning solutions for web applications and APIs.\n\nShe is a frequent contributor to open-source Elixir libraries, enjoys hacking away on programming languages in her free time, and watches far too many old movies for someone her age. Originally from Canada, she's spent most of her adult life in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\n---\n\nCode BEAM V Europe\nWebsite: https://codesync.global/conferences/code-beam-sto-2021/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/CodeBEAMio"
