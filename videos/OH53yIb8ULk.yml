In our approach, the final goal of grammar development is\nthe construction of a treebank (parsed corpus) that conforms to a\ngrammar theory.  Given an existing corpus (e.g. Penn Treebank) and a\ngrammar theory, we can construct a treebank at low cost.  Since a\nlarge-scale lexicon can be extracted automatically from the treebank,\na large-scale grammar can be developed in a short period.  In this\ntalk, I overview our method of corpus-based grammar development, in\ncomparison with manual grammar development and grammar learning.\n\nJapanese title : ?????????????????\n\nJapanese abstract :\n???????????????????????????????????\n???????????????????????????????????\n???????????????????????????????????\n??????????????(Penn Treebank ??)????????????\n???????????????????????????????????\n???????????????????????????????????\n???????????????????????????????????\n????????????????????????"
