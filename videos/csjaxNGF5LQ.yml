description: "Domain-Driven Design Europe 2020\nhttp://dddeurope.com - https://twitter.com/ddd_eu\n\nThe journey to Microservices can be very challenging. Identifying proper boundaries, integrating services, and handling infrastructure and operational complexities that Microservices come with can be very overwhelming.\n\nHow not to loose sight and to cope with those challenges and still delivering user and business value? One approach could be to focus on that part of your business that gives most competitive advantage - your core domain - and outsource undifferentiating commodities to utility suppliers.\n\nDomain Driven Design combined with Wardley Maps can help us to understand the problem domain and to focus on the core domain.\n\nIn this talk Susanne will show how Domain Driven Design and Wardley Maps can be used together to visualise how a value chain can evolve during a Microservices journey and keeping focus on your core domain.\n\nSusanne Kaiser works as an independent Tech Consultant and was previously working as a startup CTO transforming their SaaS solution from monolith to microservices.\n\nShe has a background in computer sciences and experience in software development & architecture for more than 15 years and regularly presents at international tech conferences."
