description: "Deep Dive: Self-driving Pipelines: Building the Unbreakable Continuous Delivery Pipeline with Cloud Foundry, Concourse and Dynatrace - Michael Villiger, Dynatrace\n\nShift-Left, Shift-Right, *-As-Code, and Self-Healing are some of the latest buzzwords when it comes to building and deploying cloud-native architectures. In this session Mike Villiger will bring these buzzwords to life. \n\nMike will cover how the Shifting-Right of build, deployment, and environment metadata and the Shifting-Left of deep performance information enables faster release cycles. Attendees will also learn how a common source of metrics across the tool chain can enable actionable feedback loops across all team members regardless of the hat they may be wearing on any given day. Mike will live-demo an End-to-End Continuous Delivery Pipeline with automated metrics-based quality gates between pre-production stages, an automatic post production deployment approval step as well as how self-healing (auto-remediation) can really work, with specifications all defined in source control. \n\nWhile this example unbreakable pipeline was built using Concourse, Cloud Foundry, and Dynatrace, the concepts behind this implementation apply to all other CI/CD Tool Chains (Jenkins, XL Release, etc.)\n\nAbout Michael Villiger\nMike has spent the last 20 years occupying various engineering positions surrounding web-scale performance, architecture, and operations before joining Dynatrace in 2014. At Dynatrace Mike has specialized in assisting customers implementing Application Performance Management technologies and processes in the worlds of Public/Private Cloud, DevOps, SRE, and Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS). Mike has constructed many of the technical integrations customers and partners utilize to deploy and utilize Dynatrace on their platforms.\n\nhttps://www.cloudfoundry.org/"
