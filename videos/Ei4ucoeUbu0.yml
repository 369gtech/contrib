title: '"How Flutter Can Change the Future of Urban Communities" by Edward Thornton'
language: English
recordingDate: 1634170076
description: "Flutter has the ability to become a major part in urban development. Cross Platform Programing has become a hot topic in developer communities. Cross-platform app development helps developers to roll out new applications simultaneously easily: imagine one team of native developers for one platform being behind another team of native developers - a nightmare. With the right set of cross-platform tools in hand, they can have one team developing applications for all platforms. But the real payoff for serverless is greater code simplicity and developer efficiency. Each unique offering approaches functions differently, with varying methods for triggering, scaling, and event formatting. How is that efficient?\n\nEdward Thornton\nStreet Genius Innovations\n@Streetgenius_\n\nStreet Genius is a Software & Innovations firm founded in Missouri.
