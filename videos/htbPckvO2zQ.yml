title: 'Atomics, CAS, and Nonblocking Algorithms (Alexey Fyodorov, Russia)'
language: Russian
recordingDate: 1437556204
description: 'This talk will introduce you in disadvantages of locking, CAS operations, Java atomic variable classes and a couple of nonblocking algoritms: nonblocking stack and nonblocking queue. If we have time, we will also talk about ABA problem. The talk is based on JCIP (§15) and TAoMP (§§ 5, 7, 10, 11). It will be interesting for Java programmers who have heard about CAS and lock-free, but who have no experience in writing non-blocking code.'
