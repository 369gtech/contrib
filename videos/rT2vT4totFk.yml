In this talk, Kenji will explain the similarity and difference between IPv4 and IPv6, and how the two protocols are handled in Erlang/OTP library modules. Kenji will also describe common pitfalls and lessons learned from reviewing various software packages to make them IPv6-compatible.\"\n\nFollow us on Twitter @Erlangfactory  https://twitter.com/#!/erlangfactory \nJoin our group on Linkedin Erlang Factory  http://www.linkedin.com/groups/Erlang-Factory-2003110?trk=myg_ugrp_ovr"
