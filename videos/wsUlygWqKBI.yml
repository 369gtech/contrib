title: 'Build a Reactive app in Apache Cassandra with Spring'
language: English
recordingDate: 1617307295
description: "Itâ€™s now possible to develop fully reactive Java applications with frameworks like Spring WebFlux and Reactor. In this interactive workshop we'll explore the power of these frameworks and get hands on with a reactive implementation of the popular Spring Pet Clinic reference application.\n\nWe'll do all of our work in the cloud with Gitpodâ€™s open source, zero-install and collaborative development environment . We'll use Apache Cassandraâ„¢ as the database to fit the highly concurrent, non-blocking nature of our reactive application and get familiar with the fully-managed database as-a-service called DataStax Astra.\n\nAre you ready to spring into reactive? See you there!\n\nðŸ“¥ Workshop resources:\nGitHub - https://github.com/DataStax-Academy/workshop-spring-reactive\nGitlab - https://gitlab.com/datastax-academy/workshop-spring-reactive\nGithub Official: https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-reactive\nLearn more about Cassandra at Apache and DataStax documentation websites.\n\nðŸš¨ Register for Astra now (http://dtsx.io/2OfuFfJ) - No credit card required, $25.00 USD credit every month, roughly 5M writes, 30M reads, 40GB storage monthly - sufficient to run small production workloads.\n\nðŸ”” Sign up to our event alert:\nhttps://bit.ly/subscribe-datastaxdevsâ€‹\n\nAbout DataStax: DataStax is the company behind the massively scalable, highly available, cloud-native NoSQL data platform built on Apache Cassandraâ„¢.
