description: "So your community has grown. It’s come from having only 10 people to more than 500. That’s great news! But what to do, right? You can keep adding new sessions and new meetings, and that’s always good, but what else can you be doing? Are there other things you can do with your user group? How about contributing back to the community? This session covers what the CJUG is doing to move from being just a  presentation on Java  to actually doing something more with the JCP and the community. If your JUG has survived the first hurdle (getting members, sponsorship, and venues), then come and find out about the cooler things you can do with your members that will benefit not just them but also everyone else who uses Java.\n\n\nAuthors:\nFreddy Guime\nFreddy is the Community Leader at the Chicago Java Users Group, his focus has been promoting and enhancing the adoption of Java across the Chicagoland Area (http://www.meetup.com/ChicagoJUG/) .He has created a secondary presentation tracks for CJUG members that focuses on fundamental Java Concepts while enhancing the primary track with recorded webcasts (www.youtube.com/cjugvideos).
