description: "Google Tech Talk\r\nFebruary 23, 2011\r\n\r\nPresented by Robert Gottlieb\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nIn today's food system, farm workers face hazardous conditions, low-income neighborhoods lack supermarkets but abound in fast food franchises, and food products sometimes resemble more of a high calorie chemical mash than a wholesome and healthy product. Opposing these unjust conditions, a movement for food justice has emerged, which seeks to transform our food system from field to table. Robert Gottlieb, co-author of the new book, Food Justice, will talk about the dynamic food justice groups and organizing efforts, the emerging new politics around food, and the efforts to transform the very language and understanding about food, from how food is grown to why eating has become a political act."
