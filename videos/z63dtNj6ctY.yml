description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nVitess: Stateless Storage in the Cloud - Sugu Sougoumarane, PlanetScale \n\nWhen Vitess was migrated to run from bare-metal into Google's cloud, it was deployed as a regular stateless application. This meant that a process reschedule resulted in all the local data being wiped.  The property of Vitess to survive in such an unforgiving environment made it naturally suited to run on Kubernetes.  How did Vitess manage to run on such an environment without losing data, and providing High Availability, Scale and Performance? How are other organizations running Vitess?  This session will answer these questions, as well as go into the design principles that prepared Vitess to be cloud-native. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UaeD"
