There’s a library for that!\r\n\r\nYou declare a strategy for inputs - from ‘an integer’ to ‘matching this regex’ to ‘Django model’; Hypothesis finds bugs and reports minimal failing examples. Too good to be true? Come see for yourself!\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, australia, programming, sydney\n\nThis video is licensed under CC BY 3.0 AU - https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/au/\r\n\r\nPyCon Australia (“PyCon AU”) is the national conference for the Python Programming Community, bringing together professional, student and enthusiast developers with a love for developing with Python.\n\nPyCon AU, the national Python Language conference, is on again this August in Sydney, at the International Convention Centre, Sydney, August 24 - 28 2018.\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU"
