description: "Never been to an FITC event? We'd like to change that. Just email us at neverbeen@fitc.ca for a VERY special offer!\n\nInspired by the classic paradox “What happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object?” Jeremy will explore what happens when two key aspects of every creative endeavour collide: curiosity & limitations. Using examples of his work spanning the last 10 years at Imaginary Forces, he will reveal how this collision can keep your work fresh, and lead to unexpected inspiration.\n\nJeremy Cox\nCreative Director, Imaginary Forces\n\nhttps://twitter.com/jereremy\nhttps://www.instagram.com/jeremycox/\nhttps://vimeo.com/jeremycox\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
