title: 'Smaller PNG Files (100 Days of Google Dev)'

description: "PNG files represent the bulk of android image content, especially if you’ve got a lot of UI elements in your application (rather than photo data). But PNG files also represent a huge problem in terms of file size; They are easy to bloat, and too often, we don’t give them enough attention to make them smaller. \n\nAs Colt McAnlis, explains, shrinking PNG files is a problem that’s been solved for a long time now. There’s a federation of tools out there which only focus on improving & compressing PNG files even further than you get out of your photo editing tools.\n\nDevelopers who can harness the raw power of these savings can find themselves with smaller images that are cheaper to transfer, and faster to download.\n\nWatch more Android Performance Patterns here: http://goo.gl/4ZJkY1\n\nJoin the G+ Community here: http://goo.gl/g7mxmI\n\n100 Days of Google Dev / 100 developer videos over 100 days / #GoogleDev100 \n\nSubscribe to the Google Developers channel here: http://goo.gl/mQyv5L"
