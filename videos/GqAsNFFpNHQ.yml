description: "At Carbon Five, we think reactive programming is a great way to build frontend GUI applications. We use ReactiveX, which has amazingly robust libraries across a variety of languages. We've found the concepts translate well across of a variety of client projects, platforms, and frameworks, so much so that it's almost our de facto standard way to build frontends.\n\nWe also work on React projects that use Redux. Often the Redux code becomes a pain point that slows down the rest of the project. We've begun exploring using ReactiveX's javascript library, RxJS, as an alternative to Redux, and we'd like to share what we've learned.\n\nThis talk will provide:\n\n1. A general introduction to functional reactive programming.\n2. An introduction to ReactiveX libraries\n3. A broad comparison between ReactiveX and Redux\n\nwww.twitter.com/techgirlwonder\nwww.github.com/hannahhoward"
