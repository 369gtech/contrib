description: "Get the Code Here: http://goo.gl/rjkFK\n\nWelcome to the 3rd part of my Java Hash Tables Tutorial. If you missed the previous parts you should watch them first.\n\nI will review linked lists because I've received many requests on them. I'll also show you how to hash strings, so that we can make a tool that can be used as a dictionary, spell checker, or something like Google Instant.\_I also show how to use lists in hash tables to demonstrate something called Separate Chaining."
