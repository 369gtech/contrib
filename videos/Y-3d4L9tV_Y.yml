recordingDate: 1602054338
description: "by Christoph Zimmermann\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/K.3.401/rust_redisjson.webm\n\nOver the last decade, Redis has become one of the most popular NoSQL DBs delivering on the promise of high throughput and low latency. What started as a pure C code base is gradually being augmented with Rust due to the trifecta of safety, concurrency, and speed. A primary example is thre RedisJSON module which turns Redis into a document DB.\n\n\nThe talk outlines the principal architecture of the re-implementation of RedisJSON, the challenges encountered and the solutions for these. The focus is on the practical aspects rather than conveying theoretical knowledge. A comparison with other open source document DB concludes this presentation, concentrating on latency and throughput aspects.\n\nRoom: K.3.401\nScheduled start: 2020-02-02 12:00:00"
