description: "Code Here: http://goo.gl/THKae\n\nBest Java Book : http://goo.gl/FtKp0m\n\nI introduce you to Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) in this part of my Java Video Tutorial. I focus specifically on Java Swing and its components.\n\nWe figure out how to display frames, panels, labels, buttons, text areas and more. I also go over the Dimension object and the Java Toolkit, which allows you to ask questions of the operating system."
