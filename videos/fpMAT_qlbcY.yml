Castro\n\n\nABSTRACT\nWe all have heard that functional programming requires a change of mind. But... do we really know what does mean? How does it go beyond learning about pattern-matching, tail recursion, gen_server and supervisors? How does it reflect in the way we approach problems and design solutions? We will address these and other questions, and discuss to which extent our BEAM hammer can turn everything into a lightweight, concurrent nail.\n\nSlides & full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/laura-m-castro/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - LAURA M. CASTRO\nAssociate professor and lead researcher spreading BEAM love from a little corner in Spain (University of A Coru√±a).\n\nLaura became fascinated with Erlang during her studies in Software Engineering and has been an advocate of our beloved technology ever since. Nowadays, this means she introduces the BEAM to the next generations of CS graduates, preaches it to local developer groups and FP-related events, introduces it in new projects with local companies, and exploits it as a research tool in collaboration with colleagues all around the world.\n\nMore on Laura M.
