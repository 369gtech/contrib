description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nBuilding the Cloud Native Kernel: Kubernetes Release Engineering - Tim Pepper & Stephen Augustus, VMware \n\nIs Kubernetes a kernel or distribution? Yes! It is necessarily both!     CRD’s, out-of-tree cloud providers, and CNI/CSI/CRI abstractions evolve Kubernetes’ core toward an extensible kernel.    At 2017, KubeCon NA Tim Hockin and Michael Rubin started a conversation on formalizing “Kubernetes upstream as a distro”, proposing we clean up thinking/processes, define tools/standards, incentivize distros to stay close. They argued for a Kubernetes reference distribution focused on correctness and stability.    So where is it?    After a slow start, we have momentum in 2019 to improve conformance, API stability, and better documented support stances. However to understand why we don’t (yet) have an upstream reference distro, we need to dive deep on build/release/test tooling.    This talk will summarize Kubernetes distro issues/advances and potential contribution areas for individuals and companies. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UaWx"
