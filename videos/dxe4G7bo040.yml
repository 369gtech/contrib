description: "Learn and ask questions about: \nAzure Machine Learning, IoT Edge, Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio\n\nGuest Speakers: \nMark Mydland and Pamela Cortez from the Microsoft Azure IoT team\n \nLive Event! \nOur team will be live on chat and actively answering your questions! \n\nDescription: \nFrequently, IoT applications want to take advantage of the intelligent cloud and the intelligent edge. In this Deep Dive, we walk you a predictive maintenance example\_that goes\_through training a machine learning model with data collected from IoT devices in the cloud, deploying that model to IoT Edge, and maintaining and refining the model periodically. Learn tips and resources you can use when building your own model and IoT Edge solution. The\_ML on the Edge\_Walk-through Example can be found here."
