title: 'The Prototype Mindset by Marty Haught'

description: "From the world of Lean Startups, the notion of building a minimum viable product, MVP, seems straightforward as a developer. Yet, so many development teams struggle to quickly build these prototypes. A growing list of features cause scope creep, temptations to future-proof lead to over-engineering and your project's launch dates keep slipping. We won't even mention the budget. What can a development team do?\n\nWhat if we could adopt a prototyping mindset where, as developers, we could distill a product's purpose to its essential features, identify the ideal customer and build a lightweight application to verify it meets their needs, all within a short timeframe?\n\nAfter years of building product prototypes with this mindset, we've noticed several ways our conventional developer thinking gets in the way. Join us as we examine each one and contrast it against a prototyping mindset. Not only will you be able to guide your team on how to build efficient, high-value prototypes, but you may find this approach benefits other types of projects.\n\nSoftware architect/entrepreneur passionate about building great software and teams. Marty is actively involved in the software community, most notably as an organizer of RailsConf and RubyConf. Beyond his love for the outdoors, food and music, Marty is busy raising his two children with his lovely wife and enjoying life."
