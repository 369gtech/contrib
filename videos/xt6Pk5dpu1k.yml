description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nSIG-CLI - Open Doors - Maciej Szulik, Red Hat \n\nThis session is intended for all interested in what SIG-CLI is and what it does. Whether you're fresh to Kubernetes or an old-timer you are more than welcome. This session will be fully interactive, and its contents will entirely rely on the expectations of the attendees. Topics will include, but are not limitted to: - Kubectl code tour which will provide basic knowledge for working on kubectl itself, as well as how to write kubectl plugins. - The main initiatives SIG-CLI is undertaking (splitting kubectl out of main Kubernetes repository, plugins - its development and management, resource configuration with kustomize, dynamic commands, etc.) - Gathering feedback and discussing problems people struggle the most with kubectl.\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zeu4"
