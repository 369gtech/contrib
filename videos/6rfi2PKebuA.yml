recordingDate: 1601276679
description: "by Pierre Ficheux\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/UD2.218A/ema_yocto_extra_tools.webm\n\nYocto is the most famous \"build system\" for embedded Linux. During this conference we'll study how to use some Yocto  features to help the development of a free industrial project. We will study the eSDK (extended cross-toolchain), Ptest and Testimage (CI), Devtool and Devshell (recipe modification). We will also learn how to be in compliance with the GPLv3 / LGPLv3 licenses thanks to the \"archiver\" class (and more).\n\nRoom: UD2.218A\nScheduled start: 2020-02-01 15:30:00"
