description: "We will discuss approaches to design hybrid data structures, mixing carefully chosen amounts of strictness and laziness for the desired result. Our main examples are infinite semilazy lists with constant-time access (thus combining properties of usual lists and vectors) and infinite lazy sets.\n\nThe applications vary from caching to number theory and from business calendars to recursive functions.\n\nSlides: https://github.com/Bodigrim/my-talks/raw/master/fby2019/slides.pdf"
