description: "Automatic suggestion functionality on most websites are simply standard Solr fuzzy wildcard queries on a concatenated index. For the Dutch public transportation website 9292.nl we created a more contextual autocompletion function, that uses the different address fields of the source database to its advantage, which allows it to better understand what address a user means in this highly ambiguous data environment. We will show the methods used and explain how this may help bring autocompletion functionality to the next level for faceted indexes.\n\nMore info: https://2012.berlinbuzzwords.de/sessions/smart-autocompl"
