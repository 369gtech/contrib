description: "Avi Borthakur, Oracle\n\nParvez Syed Mohamed, Director of Product Management, MCS, Oracle\n\nWith the rapid evolution of mobile app development tools, creating a great mobile UI has become easier than ever before. However, a pretty UI is just a small part of overall user experience. A truly engaging mobile application has to perform regardless of networking conditions, leverage full device capabilities, and actively notify users of critical events. In this session learn about a platform approach to shape APIs for mobile consumption, deliver data synchronization services, leverage device features, and seamlessly integrate with notificationsâ€”everything that will help you build more engaging mobile apps faster."
