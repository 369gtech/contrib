title: 'Integrating JavaFX with Native Technologies'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433784668
description: "JavaFX is a powerful, efficient, scene graphâ€“based graphics technology that runs on a variety of platforms. Depending on the application, it might be necessary to augment JavaFX to access the underlying native platform. It could be that a platform-specific feature is critical to an application. The application may need to make use of pre-existing native code, or an area of the application might have strict performance requirements that only native code can provide. This session examines ways that applications can extend JavaFX to use native technologies, with a focus on OpenGL.\n\n\nAuthors:\nFelipe Heidrich\nFelipe is an engineer on the JavaFX team at Oracle.
