description: "by Andreia Gaita\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/K.3.201/typescript_il_game_modding.webm\n\n\nIn the game development world, games are built in layers, and it's common to have different languages for the different layers. C/C++ is a common choice for the engine layer, while C# is a popular choice for the scripting layer - the one that gameplay is implemented with, and the one available for users to mod their games with. There's multiple engines built on C# (Unity and Monogame come to mind). \n\nWhen I started implementing my own runtime-moddable game with Unity, I realized how awkward C# is for scripting, and how there just might be a better language for this. In this talk we'll look at what a game scripting language ideally needs and does, why C# is not quite the best of fits, and why Typescript is - when it targets the .NET runtime! \n\nAt the end, you'll hopefully have a better understanding of how languages fit in game development and what (great!) tooling Typescript has for introspection and compiling. \n\nRoom: K.3.201\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 11:30:00+01"
