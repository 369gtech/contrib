description: "Get the Code: http://goo.gl/md0pw\n\nOne of you guys sent me a request to explain the chapter in Refactoring to Patterns titled Encapsulate Composite with Builder. We will build a table structure (composite) using the Builder design pattern.\n\nI'll expand the capabilities of the code from this great book to allow us to more easily traverse the tree structure. This will allow us to add children, siblings and item information using a HashMap. This is a beautiful refactoring. All of the code can be found above to help you learn it."
