description: 'Whilst 802.15.4 technologies such as Zigbee have been around for some time, our understanding of threats and risks associated with it have been lacking. As new use cases evolve, so have the opportunities for attack and exploitation. The purpose of this talk is to provide a real world exploration of where I''ve been finding zigbee devices with a purpose built war driving kit, some of the live collection I''ve done as well as an exploration of risks and what can be done. By the end of this talk, audience members will have an appreciation for cool technologies floating around their environments, an appreciation the issues associated with the 802.15.4 protocol, and how to plan and prepare from a security standpoint.'
