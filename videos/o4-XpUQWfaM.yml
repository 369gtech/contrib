description: "This month we focused Oracle Label Security (OLS). Label Security is one of our oldest security features, originally introduced with Oracle 9.0. OLS is widely deployed in cases where fine-grained control of data access is required. Over the past few years, regulations like GDPR have driven increased interest in Label Security.\n\nWe covered the basics components of OLS, and then walk through a typical use case.
