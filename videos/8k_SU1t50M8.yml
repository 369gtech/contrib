recordingDate: 1357342224
description: "Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) provide us with a means of creating more succinct languages for expressing certain kinds of code, while still maintaining a tight integration with the host language. Haskell provides many features which make it a great language for implementing DSLs, such as the ability to create arbitrary operators, lightweight function application syntax, and quasi-quotation. In this webcast presented by Michael Snoyman, author of Developing Web Applications with Haskell and Yesod, he will cover some of the different DSL implementation strategies, their relative strengths and weaknesses, and general design guidelines, all inspired from real life examples.\n\nAbout Michael Snoyman\n\nMichael Snoyman, creator of Yesod, has been programming for about 15 years, using Haskell for the past five. 5. He brings ten years of web development experience in a wide variety of environments as well as time spent creating documentation.\n\nProduced by: Yasmina Greco"
