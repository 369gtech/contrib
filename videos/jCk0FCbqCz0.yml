description: "HighLoad++ 2015, 2 ноября\n\nПрезентация и тезисы:\nhttp://www.highload.ru/2015/abstracts/1873.html\n\nВидео с русским переводом: https://youtu.be/ReY7e_IO368\n\nMongoDB exhibits a fairly classic leader-based replication architecture, with builtin automatic provisioning and failovers. Since it was developed, an academic paper from Stanford has introduced a distributed consensus algorithm called Raft - which happens to be rather similar to the home grown algorithm of MongoDB. This talk will give a brief overview of Raft and how we are retrofitting some of it into MongoDB 3.2 to make our replication even more robust."
