description: "Brendan Tierney\nOralytics\n\nMachine learning is one of the hottest technologies around the world. But what are real companies doing with machine learning? We keep on hearing what Google, Facebook, Amazon, and other big companies are doing with machine learning. But not every one is like or of the size of these companies. This presentation will look at 10 case studies of machine learning projects that I have worked on, including churn, supply chain optimisation, predictive maintenance, social interaction, fraud detection, driver alertness app, etc. For each case study we will discuss how defining the right question focuses the machine learning work in a very efficient way, allowing the company to focus on generate results within a few days or weeks."
