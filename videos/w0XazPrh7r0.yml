description: "The Physical Web is an approach to unleash the core superpower of the web: interaction on demand. People should be able to walk up to any smart device - a vending machine, a poster, a toy, a bus stop, a rental car - and not have to download an app first. This talk is led by Scott Jenson, leader of the Physical Web at Google, who discusses how to enable the 'walk up and use' functionality of any device or object.\n\nWatch more talks from Ubiquity Dev Summit here: https://goo.gl/FS9v3U\n\nSubscribe to the Google Developers channel at http://goo.gl/mQyv5L\n\nMusic by Terra Monk: http://www.terramonk.com"
