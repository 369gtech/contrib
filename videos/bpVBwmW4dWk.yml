description: "Storytelling appears to be a magic word when it comes to creating user experience—we use it to evoke design ideals, to summon the creative spirit, or to cry out for a narrative link across the complex world of brand identity, multiple devices and short attention spans. In the context of design, we often talk about using the three-act structure, characters, and how conflict is a key essential ingredient. But is it all there is?\n\nSteph spent a few years learning from the art of making documentaries, crime fiction, novels and the shortest of stories. In this session, Steph will show how understanding the essence and practice of story opens a world of possibilities and adds another dimension to your UX toolset. Better still, it’s less of a mystery than what you might think.\n\nAbout Steph: https://about.me/stephtroeth\nFollow Steph: https://twitter.com/sniffles\n\nMore about CSS Day: https://cssday.nl or https://twitter.com/cssdayconf\nReceive conference announcements in your inbox: https://cssday.nl/subscribe"
