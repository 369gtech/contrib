description: "Business Agility Australia is a conference aimed at executives, thought leaders and practitioners who wish to build customer and purpose-driven organisations that will thrive in volatile and unpredictable markets.\n\nWe’re looking for great stories in business agility; anything from organisational design, market disruption and product innovation, agile outside IT and next-gen leadership. We have a preference for unusual or unique stories outside IT. However, they must be authentic experiences. No ideas, models or frameworks that have only been tried once or commercial pitches.\n\nThe conference has a unique format. There is a single session for everyone. Each day has three (2.5 hour) panels; the Executive Panel (for senior leaders to share their stories about organisation transformation), Thought Leader Panel (for thought leaders to share the latest stories from the industry) and the Practitioner Panel (for practitioners to share their stories from the trenches). Each session will consist of 3, 20-minute, “art of the possible” stories, a short Q/A with all the speakers and a “deep dive” into the domain. What is your “art of the possible” story?"
