description: "Wait...CSS algorithms? Can one really write algorithms in CSS? Absolutely.\n\nThis talk is all about CSS algorithms: what they are, how to write them, and the potential impacts of a word like \"algorithm\" when it comes to both the CSS in your code-bases and CSS in the larger context of web development.\n\nLara Schenck\nPenske Media Corporation\n@laras126\n\nLara Schenck is fascinated by the profound, yet subtle, overlap between programming, computer science fundamentals, and CSS. She spreads her enthusiasm for this topic at her day job as a Design Ops Engineer for Penske Media Corporation, where she leads the design systems effort for big media publications powered by WordPress, and through speaking and community involvement. Lara writes about her work and life [on her blog](https://notlaura.com/blog/), illustrates [friendly monsters](https://notlaura.com/monsters), and inspires all of us who work with the web to seek a deeper understanding of the code we write and the tools we use."
