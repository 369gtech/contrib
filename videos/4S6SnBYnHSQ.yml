Ближайшая конференция — DotNext\_2020 Piter\n15-18 июня, Online\nПодробности и билеты: https://bit.ly/dotnext2020piter\n\n. It has never been more important to create apps that also work offline. Mobile app users can flick that \"airplane mode\" switch any given time and the cellular connection isn't as stable as it is at home. To ensure great user experience you, as a developer, need to account for these scenarios. And honestly: that can be a pain in the butt.\n\nIn this session Gerald will show you how to use awesome libraries like Akavache and Polly to create connected apps in a very easy way. Step-by-step he will guide you through a sample application, so after his talk you can go home and implement it in your every app. Have a good flight!"
