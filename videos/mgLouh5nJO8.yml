description: "This video was recorded at Code Mesh LDN 18 http://bit.ly/2P7SPII\n\nGet involved in Code Sync's next conference http://bit.ly/2Mcm4aS\n\n---\n\nABSTRACT NONSENSE\nby Ju Gonçalves\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nMonoids\nEffects\nArt\n\nTALK LEVEL: Intermediate / Advanced\n\nABSTRACT\nGenerative art programming requires many effectful computations, such as random number generation and image output. What if we applied category theory to model a declarative, purely functional way of programming artworks? In other words, what if we could generate abstract nonsense with abstract nonsense?\n\nRead the full abstract: http://codesync.global/speaker/ju-goncalves192/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - JU GONÇALVES\nPhd Student in Computer Science\n\nJu Gonçalves is a young computer scientist based in Copenhagen. They can usually be seen working on their Ph.D. on Type Theory at Roskilde University or playing with Nintendo games on the streets of Copenhagen. They are a member of Programming, Logic and Intelligent Systems research group, and many interesting forums. For them, pokémons and bugs in programming language development have something in common, they gotta catch 'em all!\n\nMore on Ju Gonçalves: http://codesync.global/speaker/ju-goncalves192/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE MESH LDN 18\nCode Mesh LDN is powered by Code Sync.
