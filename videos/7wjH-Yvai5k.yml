description: "Dan Macpherson\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/159/\n\nAutomation is here! Robots will soon be doing all our jobs, right? The only option technical writers have left is to panic and run for hills before our robot masters enslave us all, right?\r\n\r\nRelax. There is no cause for alarm. This presentation will look at automation for technical writers and why technical writers should embrace the wonderful world of automation. This presentation will discuss:\r\n\r\n- The role of a technical writer in the world of automation and why the role is essentially safe (though might change in some respects)\r\n- Advice on how technical writers can embrace automation when developing documentation\r\n\r\nYou'll walk away from this presentation with a new-found respect for automation and a desire to fist-bump the nearest robot!\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
