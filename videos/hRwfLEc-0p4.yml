description: "Chaos engineering is intentionally injecting failure into a system to proactively identify and fix problems before they cause outages. Itâ€™s an emerging discipline, but its roots are decades old. So why is it now becoming the go-to approach for building resilient systems? Why does the current state of distributed architectures require chaos as the best solution for system failure?\n\nKolton Andrus explores how chaos engineering has evolved into the discipline now practiced at leading cloud companies, how to begin your journey toward resilient systems, and how to make those pagers quit buzzing at 3:00am.\n\nSubscribe to O'Reilly on YouTube: http://goo.gl/n3QSYi\n\nFollow O'Reilly on: \nTwitter: http://twitter.com/oreillymedia\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/OReilly\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/oreillymedia\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/8459/"
