description: "Scott Wierschem, Founder, Keep Calm and Refactor\n\nAdding tests to legacy code is hard, if not sometimes impossible. The code is often difficult to understand and usually written without testing in mind. Changing such code is a fearful task! With Approval Tests, adding tests to untestable and unintelligible code is not only possible but even simple and (believe it or not) fun. Imagine being able to confidently refactor code you donâ€™t understand. That is the power of Approval Tests. Even more, BDD and TDD are also easier with Approval Tests. Come to this session to learn a new way to add tests to old code."
