Fortunately, many of these are easily preventable by paying more attention to the warnings from our apps. However, it's often so easy to put them under the rug and never come back until we find a bug in production, which leads to hundreds if now thousands of warnings appearing in our test output. This talk is about how to prevent this situation and how to get out of it.\n\n\nThis event would not take place without the support of sponsors:\n\nPlatinum Sponsors\nSauce Labs → https://saucelabs.com/\n\nGold Sponsors\nStackHawk → https://www.stackhawk.com/\nNeuralegion → https://www.neuralegion.com/\n\nSilver Sponsor\nTestim → https://www.testim.io/\n\nProduction Partner\nFocus Reactive → https://focusreactive.com/"
