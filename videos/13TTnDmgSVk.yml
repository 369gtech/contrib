description: "Haim Yadid: The Taste of AWS Lambda in Production\n\nHaim Yadid, Head of Backend Engineering at Next Insurance\nA software engineer with over 25 years of experience in various technology fields: software development, team management, software architecture, HPC and algorithmic research. Currently leading the backend engineering group in Next Insurance. On my spare time I am also one of the organizers of Java.IL, the Israeli Java user group.\n\nHow we integrated AWS Lambda into our technology stack\nIn Next insurance we use micro service architecture over AWS. A year ago we have introduced AWS lambda into our stack. The majority of our code still deployed as services, however, we already have production functionality deployed as functions. In this talk I will describe the way we do it. I will cover topics such as deployment, logging, configuration,DB access, etc."
