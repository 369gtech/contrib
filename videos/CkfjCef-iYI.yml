description: "Ten years ago, I wrote the first edition of The Passionate Programmer: Creating a Remarkable Career in Software Development. At the time, it represented my best understanding of how a normal person could move from a typical career path to a remarkable one. You learn a lot in 10 years. Old patterns to out to have not been patterns after all. New patterns emerge. And the clich√© fits: less is more.\n\nIn this talk, I'll tell you what the 40+ year old me would advise the 30 year old who wrote that book. How does one create a remarkable career? What is the least I have to know and do?"
