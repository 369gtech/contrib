description: "Burr Sutter, Global Director of Developer Experience, Red Hat\nRafael Benevides, Director of Developer Experience, Red Hat\n\nThe first generation of microservices was shaped primarily by Netflix OSS and leveraged by numerous Spring Cloud annotations all throughout your business logic. The next generation of microservices will leverage sidecars and a service mesh. This session gives you a taste of Envoy and Istio, two open source projects that will change the way you write distributed Java applications on Kubernetes. Check out how the speakers use Envoy and Istio to deal with traffic shaping, network fault injection, A/B testing, dark launches, mirroring, and much more."
