description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2016\n—\nThere has been an overwhelming amount of tension in the programming world over the last year due to something that has become an expletive, a cursed and despised term, both obscene and profane: **undefined behavior**. All too often, this issue and the discussions surrounding it descend into unproductive territory without actually resolving anything. \n\nIn this talk, I'm going to try something very bold. I will try to utterly and completely do away with the use of the term \"undefined behavior\" in these discussions. And I will unquestionably fail. But in the process of failing, I will outline a framework for understanding the actual root issues that the software industry faces here, and try to give constructive and clear paths forward, both for programmers and the programming language. \n\nAnd, with luck, I will avoid being joined on stage by any unruly nasal demons.\n— \nChandler Carruth\nGoogle\nC++ Lead\nSan Francisco Bay Area\nChandler Carruth leads the Clang team at Google, building better diagnostics, tools, and more. Previously, he worked on several pieces of Google’s distributed build system. He makes guest appearances helping to maintain a few core C++ libraries across Google’s codebase, and is active in the LLVM and Clang open source communities. He received his M.S. and B.S. in Computer Science from Wake Forest University, but disavows all knowledge of the contents of his Master’s thesis. He is regularly found drinking Cherry Coke Zero in the daytime and pontificating over a single malt scotch in the evening.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
