Without it, a complex software system is a complicated software system. In this talk, an important abstraction tool is considered: function totality. It covers termination and productivity. If a supposedly terminating program is not total, it can lead to a program crash or an infinite loop. Furthermore, a non-total program that needs to run forever can end up in a deadlock. This talk covers techniques for achieving function totality.\n\nRead the full abstract: http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2019/marko-dimjasevic\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - MARKO DIMJAŠEVIĆ\nComputer scientist interested in correct software\n\nMarko Dimjašević is a computer scientist with research interests in type theory and formal methods. He is an engineer at Input Output Hong Kong where he works on formally specifying a blockchain. Marko holds a doctoral degree in computer science from the University of Utah, USA. His dissertation was on automatic software testing. At NASA he performed research and development on software testing and runtime verification techniques for an aircraft collision avoidance system.\ndimjasevic.net/marko\n\nMore on Marko Dimjašević: http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2019/marko-dimjasevic\n\n---\n\nLAMBDA DAYS & ERLANG SOLUTIONS\nLambda Days is powered by Erlang Solutions.
