description: "Native apps are the best. They are the most performant and integrate well into the OS. They just feel right. It's just that implementing complex business logic for every platform separately is not fun at all. You keep reinventing the wheel and will end up fixing the same errors over and over again.\n\nDjinni is here to help! Djinni is a tool for generating cross-language type declarations and interface bindings. It enables writing C++ code that can easily be used from Java, Objective-C and Python. Djinni takes care of all the nasty and repetitive glue code to translate from one world to the other. That even includes passing exceptions from Java to C++ and back to Java!\n\nIn this presentation I'll show you how you only need to define your shared types and interfaces once, write their implementations in C++ and then use it like any other API native to iOS or Android.\n\nLet Djinni work its magic for you too!\n\nStephan Jaetzold is a geek for native applications. He was mostly doing desktop apps with Java when the App Store came out. Writing native applications for a device that you always have with you and that's connected to the internet? Hell yeah! Originally from Germany, his work on the photo app Loom (Webby award winner 2014) got him a job in Silicon Valley where he worked at Dropbox on their mobile apps. He's now back in Europe making native iOS Apps as a freelancer.\n\n[XOE-6216]"
