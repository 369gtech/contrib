Youâ€™re in a meeting and the presenter is sharing data-driven insights. But it makes no sense! Itâ€™s not the data thatâ€™s the problem: itâ€™s the way they are presented. The Last Mile of Data Analytics is how to present your data. Your investment in people and technology means nothing if you do not effectively share the insight with others, to drive better decisions. Designing charts for meetings, presentations or even keynotes is a learnable skill. Andy Cotgreave, author of the Big Book of Dashboards, and Computingâ€™s Analytics Professional of the Year, has sat through thousands of meetings, and seen many crimes committed against data. Heâ€™s even committed many himself. Heâ€™s also seen how effectively it can be done, with a little bit of effort. In this entertaining keynote, youâ€™re going to learn how to make your data look amazing."
