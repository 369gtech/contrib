title: 'Spring: Your Next Java Micro-Framework'
language: English
recordingDate: 1601027837
description: "Quite often, Spring is opposed to so-called “micro” frameworks in the Java world. “Micro” means different things to different people, but it usually implies reduced runtime footprint and increased code simplicity. In this talk, I’ll show that you don’t have to abandon your favorite Spring Boot to a new and shiny thing to achieve the same result. Also, I’ll show how to find the balance between simplicity and productivity and improve runtime efficiency (such as image size, memory footprint, and startup time) when using Spring Boot.\n\nAlexey Nesterov, Software Engineer at VMware\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/spring-your-next-java-microframework"
