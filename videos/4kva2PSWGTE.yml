description: "Far from HAL or Her, the current generation of voice interfaces represents an incredibly important step forward - but the journey to the next generation of experiences is far from over. In this talk, Cheryl draws from her extensive NUI experience to highlight several key shortcomings of today’s voice interfaces. As we examine those shortcomings, we will discover important opportunities for today’s product teams that apply to both dedicated voice systems and multimodal interfaces. Together, we'll discover the path towards a future that includes more adaptive, inclusive, humane voice interfaces for all. - Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/amuse\n\nSave the date!
