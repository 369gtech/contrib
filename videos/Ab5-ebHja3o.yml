description: "Video with transcript included: http://bit.ly/2nK3xbJ\n\nIndu Alagarsamy talks about the intersection of DDD as a software discipline with Messaging as a technology counterpart. DDD allows us to move faster and write high-quality code. When we start to use the technology of messaging to communicate between clean and well-defined bounded contexts we get to remove temporal coupling. We now have microservices that are built for autonomy from the ground up.\n\nThis presentation was recorded at QCon New York 2019: http://bit.ly/2KFk7SO\n\nThe next QCon is Qcon San Francisco 2019 – Nov 11-13, 2019: http://bit.ly/2ZFJW9S \n\nFor more awesome presentations on innovator and early adopter topics check InfoQ’s selection of talks from conferences worldwide https://bit.ly/2tm9loz\n\n#DomainDrivenDesign #Microservices #SoftwareArchitecture"
