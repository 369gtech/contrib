description: "BOSH: The Road Ahead - Morgan Fine & Danny Berger, Pivotal\n\nIf you are a Cloud Foundry Application Runtime or Container Runtime user, you probably use BOSH as well. Many of the best features of those platforms leverage improvements in BOSH.\n\nIn this session, Morgan Fine and Danny Berger will tell you all about the past, present, and future of BOSH. Learn what the team delivered in the last few months, what it is working on right now, and have a privileged look at the project's roadmap.\n\nAbout Danny Berger\nDanny is a software engineer at heart who has worn many hats across several different industries with the goal of making sure businesses can succeed technically. He first discovered BOSH when researching open source infrastructure management tools, and soon he was creating BOSH releases and managing production environments with it. Eventually he found his way to Pivotal where he is a Software Engineer on the BOSH Core team who enjoys demystifying BOSH and its eccentricities.\n\nAbout Morgan Fine\nMorgan Fine is a Product Manager at Pivotal, currently working on BOSH. Heâ€™s previously worked as a software engineer and product manager of cf-mysql-release as well as helped on a variety of other Cloud Foundry related projects within Pivotal R&D.\n\nhttps://www.cloudfoundry.org/"
