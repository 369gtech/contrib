description: "Slides and more info: http://www.codemesh.io/codemesh2015/jon-pretty\n\nScala's type system allows us to enforce compile-time constraints on our programs, and to take advantage of these constraints to help reason about our code. Yet we still frequently encounter situations where extracting a value from a map is not guaranteed to succeed, or mapping across a set of cases is not guaranteed to be exhaustive. With dependent types we can make operations like these completely safe by construction, in the process eliminating entire classes of errors, and furthermore we can do this without complicating user code. The talk will cover several simple and intermediate examples using dependent types, and will give a brief outline of some of the the challenges involved in implementing typesafe libraries with dependent types in Scala.\n\nTalk objectives:\n\nDemonstrating how dependent types can help users write safer, more reliable software.\n\nTarget audience:\n\nThe talk will be accessible to all programmers, though a basic understanding of Scala syntax and type systems will be useful.\n\nAbout Jon\n\nJon has been having fun riding the bleeding edge of Scala for over a decade, and he's not done yet. While he's not travelling the world attending Scala conferences, or organizing his own (Scala World), Jon spends his time working on the open-source Rapture libraries and Typelevel Scala."
