description: "Git. It can be intimidating if you're accustomed to other kinds of source control management. Even if you're already using it and comfortable with the basics, situations can arise where you wish you understood it better. Developers often just want to write code and tell everyone else to take a hike, but the reality is that most of us work on teams where the feature-based code we write must be integrated, tested, and ultimately released.\n\nThis session will cover the most critical git concepts, basic and advanced, in a completely visualized way. At the same time, youâ€™ll pick up git terminal commands to help you understand (or even eliminate) a git GUI you already use. Go beyond the basics to learn how to get yourself out of a git pickle, practical release management strategies, and more."
