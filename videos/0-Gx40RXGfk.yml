The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nDeep Dive: Harbor - Enterprise Cloud-native Artifact Registry - Steven Zou, VMware & Daniel Jiang, VMware \n\nHarbor is an open-source trusted cloud-native registry project that stores, signs, and scans content. It has been widely used by organizations large and small around the world to resolve both the container image and Helm Chart management challenges. In this session, we will cover some advanced features of using Harbor, such as OIDC support, improved content replication among Harbor and other non-Harbor registries, content management in a cloud environment, unified management of Helm Chart and container images, quota management, webhooks, tag retention, highly-available deployments and more. Our guest speaker and fellow Harbor maintainer, Daniel Pacak from Aqua Security, will show you how to utilize the pluggable scanning framework in Harbor to increase confidence in your compliance policies.   Additionally, we'd like to share some Harbor community-related things like the governance model and contributing guide to encourage more participation in the Harbor community. Furthermore, the team would love to get feedback from users and contributors to current features and future roadmap. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Uagp"
