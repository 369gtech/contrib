language: English
recordingDate: 1632327279
description: "As Kubernetes clusters and environments begin proliferating, it becomes more and more important to lay down a common Kubernetes runtime in every environment. In this talk, we’ll cover why GitOps is so important when building and deploying platforms, as well as how to use a GitOps tool like Flux or ArgoCD to prepare a Kube cluster to host your applications. We’ll also dive into how to chain dependencies so applications are installed in sequence when necessary and in parallel when possible.\n\nJason Morgan, Technical Evangelist at Buoyant\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/gitops-your-kubernetes-runtime-and-you"
