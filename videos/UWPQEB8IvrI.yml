Products and functionality covered in the Autonomous Health Framework's (AHF) family include the Applied Machine Learning-based products of Cluster Health Advisor (CHA), Hang Manager (HM) and Trace File Analyzer (TFA), as well as performance management and continuous availability functionality in ORAchk/EXAchk, Memory Guard, Cluster Health Monitor Cluster Verification Utility and QoS Management. \n\nKlaus Thielen joins me for this session covering the Cluster Health Advisor GUI and its functionality to drill down into the analysis and evidence of database and cluster node issues.\n\n03:40 - What is Oracle’s goal in developing the Cluster Health Advisor GUI (CHAG)?\n04:50 - Since it was internal, why was it made available to Oracle customers?\n05:40 - What does this tool look like ?\n08:10 - I see the Nodes and DB are listed separately. Are they correlated?\n09:12 - What is the difference between using it in real-time and offline?\n11:09 - How do I get this “mdb” file to analyze?\n12:00 - Could you provide some insight in what direction will be with CHA and MGMT DB on Exadata environments?\n13:20 - Can you walk through a typical use scenario of CHAG?\n19:00 - You mention “predicted values” for each metric. Can I see what these are?\n23:18 - Is the predicted time based upon historic data of the system itself? Are there any hard ranges on top of this?\n24:33 - What with systems that gradually start getting higher wait events?\n26:56 - What are some other scenarios that CHAG is useful fo?\n31:13 - How can I tell which Problems were happening most frequently?\n34:53 - Where can I get the CHA GUI?\n35:45 - What is involved in installing the CHA GUI?\n37:44 - Which DB versions does CHA GUI support?\n39:00 - Does this tool require the GIMR to be deployed?\n40:18 - What happens now that the GIMR is optional?\n43:37 - There is another CHA tool called CHA Finding Explorer. How do they compare?\n45:00 - Can CHAFE and CHAG work together?\n46:00 - Is it necessary to run the CHA at server side or we can run this at a client machine?\n\nAskTOM Office Hours offers free, monthly training and tips on how to make the most of Oracle Database, from Oracle product managers, developers and evangelists.\n\nhttps://asktom.oracle.com/\n\nOracle Developers portal: https://developer.oracle.com/\nSign up for your Always Free Oracle Cloud tier! https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/"
