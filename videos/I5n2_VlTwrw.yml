description: "This presentation examines how Bintray (bintray.com), JFrogâ€™s social binary distribution service, works behind the scenes. It discusses how the system is segmented to support massive loads across various data centers; how JFrog chose between physical and virtual servers and between hosted and self-managed services; how Grails applications can scale out; and and how various NoSQL technologies such as CouchDB, MongoDB, and Redis are tied up to fit different needs. It also shows how Java technologies such as Grizzly and Jersey can provide lightweight alternatives to traditional Web technologies and demonstrates how no-interruption deployments are done to provide continuous distribution of binaries to developers worldwide.\n\n\nAuthor:\nYoav Landman\nYoav is a Java professional with over 10 years of hands-on experience.
