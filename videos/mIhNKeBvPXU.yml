description: "On March 26th, Thursday, we had our 1st e-Meetup with a software developer (and great guitarist!) Dylan Beattie and Maryam Umar - a Head of QA of a Fintech firm!\n\n💣Dylan Beattie - in this talk “Welcome to the Metaverse”, he shared some of the tips, tools, and ideas he’s learned so far - whether you’re virtualizing a conference, running remote workshops, collaborating with your team or just hanging out and chatting with your friends, we’re all learning a lot of unfamiliar technology in a big hurry. We figured out how to make it fun!\n\n💣Maryam Umar - she now works in QA as a manager with a special focus on sustainable delivery practices. In addition to this, Maryam has been a keen advocate of creating and sustaining diverse teams! Her e-Meetup topic was “Keeping on top of software quality remotely”. We were eager to hear more!"
