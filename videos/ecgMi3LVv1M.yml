title: 'nor(DEV):live - Effective communication in the workplace – Real vs Virtual'
recordingDate: 1594969205
description: "We rely on a number of elements to be able to successfully communicate our thoughts and ideas and inevitably what we are hoping to communicate isn’t always what is received by the other person.\n\nThis miscommunication can result in misunderstandings, confusion and in some cases, conflict in the workplace (virtual or otherwise) and can subsequently affect workplace relationships, productivity\nand wellbeing.\n\nRead more and RSVP on Meetup: https://www.meetup.com/Norfolk-Developers-NorDev/events/270952358/\n\nGive us a Hola in the Live Chat! You've also got several other options to follow along, ask questions and speak with the community:\n\n- You can join our Discord server, where you'll find a new dedicated voice channel (#event-room) to hang out in\n- As always, please connect with us on Twitter, LinkedIn, or Facebook and you can send us your questions to use there.
