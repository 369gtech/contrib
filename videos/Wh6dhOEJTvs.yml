description: "The Challenges of Onboarding People With Zero Cloud Foundry Experience: A Newcomer’s POV - Martín Valencia Flores, anynines GmbH\n\nEvery developer starts off as a rookie. Even when taking into account those rare, talented individuals that almost seem to absorb knowledge through their fingertips, there is always a shared status: newcomer. From the perspective of onboarding, multiple factors come into play. While person being onboarded is arguably the most important one, we also have to look at our approach: Is the process too technical? Do we require an historical background to the topic at hand? Is the topic overly complicated? Can we mitigate this? Martín will share some of the challenges in onboarding people with no experience in Cloud Foundry from a newcomer's perspective. He will also cover the virtues of Cloud Foundry itself, its fast curve for beginners, and the ease of the continuous learning process for mid to high levels; which allow developers to transition almost seamlessly into the cloud ecosystem.\n\nTo learn more about Cloud Foundry, The Proven Developer Experience For Kubernetes click here: https://www.cloudfoundry.org/"
