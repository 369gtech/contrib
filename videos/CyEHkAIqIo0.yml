title: 'Architecting Cloud-Native Apps with AKS and Cosmos DB - CFS2002'
recordingDate: 1557271397
description: 'In this session we will start with a modern app and optimize it for Kubernetes using AKS,  In addition to migrating to AKS, we will take advantage of native Azure services like  Cosmos DB API for Mongo DB ( in the process comparing with options like running dockerized Mongo DB or hosted Mongo DB Atlas).  We will also discuss the Kubernetes concepts like service discovery, external services, and service catalog and how they relate to AKS and Cosmos DB interaction. Finally, we will look at Cosmos DB capabilities like the Virtual Network Service Endpoints as a way to secure the traffic between AKS and Cosmos DB.'
