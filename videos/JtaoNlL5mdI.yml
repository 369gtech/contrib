title: 'Lost in transaction? Strategies to deal with (in-)consistency in distributed systems - Bernd Rücker'
language: English
recordingDate: 1538644432
description: "You probably work on a distributed system. Even if you don’t yet face a serverless microservice architecture using fancy NoSQL databases, you might simply call some remote services via REST or SOAP. This leaves you in charge of dealing with consistency yourself.\n\nACID transactions are only available locally within components and protocols like two-phase commit don’t scale. Many projects either risk adventurous inconsistencies or write a lot of code for consistency management in the application layer.\n\nIn this talk Bernd discusses these problems and goes over possible solutions, including the Saga-Pattern. Bernd will discuss recipes, patterns and frameworks that allow us to manage the right level of consistency but concentrate on the business logic. Expect fun little live hacking sessions with open source components, but also real-life stories."
