description: "Never been to an FITC event? We'd like to change that. Just email us at neverbeen@fitc.ca for a VERY special offer!\n\nFor the past 150 years or since the birth of the industrial revolution, our society has lived in the world of mass commercialization. We have mass-marketing, mass-production and mass distribution. Our clothing, products, entertainment and news have been created for the broadest possible appeal to maximize efficiency and profitability. The drawback is that, we have uniform products and experiences that are often over simplified to appeal to everyone but no one in particular. This is all about to change. We are going from mass commercialization to mass personalization and customization. Advances in technology, from the methods of production and distribution, the internet, on demand media and content, and other forms of new technology means we can now economically and feasibly create products and services that put the individual at the center of the equation.\n\nMax Burton\nCEO and Founder, Matter, Inc.\nhttp://www.instagram.com/matterglobal/\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
