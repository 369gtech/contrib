Yet it's these \"just for fun\" projects that drive us towards greater knowledge and inspire us at our jobs. But... how do you find an interesting topic for a project?\n\nI will share the paths I have taken to inspire myself in the quest for new pet projects. Join me as I show you my attempts at:\n\nUnraveling the inner workings of a certain Pocket Monster mobile game;\n\nCreating a mobile game using only vanilla Java (no extra libraries);\n\nCreating an autonomous infra-red battle tank;\n\nDriving a Lego Boost robot using Java;\n\nI will show you the code I wrote, the hurdles I faced and, most importantly, the lessons I learned, and how those insights help me in my daily developer life.\n\nIf you want to do a pet project but have no idea where to start or what to do, this is the talk for you.\n\nTom Cools \nFrom Info Support NV\nGeek in all facets of the word, including but not limited to boardgames, comic books and programming. Developer without borders, both geographically and technically. Active as a consultant, usually for some of the biggest financial institutions in both Belgium and The Netherlands. Next to that I am trainer/teacher who loves to share not only knowledge but also passion for our craft."
