recordingDate: 1505311406
description: "The goal with reactive programming is to create an event-driven system that handles load and failures in a much better way, and to create a more responsive system (for example a more reactive/responsive UI). \n\nIn this talk I will give an introduction to what it is all about and also give some practical examples by using the RxJava framework. \n\nPer Lilja is a Architect/Developer working as a consultant at One Agency. Co-Organizer for Javaforum Malmö. \n___________________________\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry.
