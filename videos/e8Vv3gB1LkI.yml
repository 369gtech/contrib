description: "Rusty Russell\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/286/\n\nIn which Uncle Rusty tells a nostalgia-drenched tale of the founding of the conference.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/\n\n#linux.conf.au #linux #foss #opensource"
