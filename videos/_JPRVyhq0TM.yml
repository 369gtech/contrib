title: 'The Business Minded Tester - Håkan Ramberg'

description: "Most testers are technical skilled and do often focus their competence development sharpening these skills. This by itself is not a problem but it is a real problem if we ignore to increase our skills within the business domain.\n\nHåkan explains why testers need to understand why companies really invest in testing. By asking the right questions and\nproviding insights of how the product really works, the tester can become an invaluable asset to the development team and external stakeholders. Product owners for example do care great about their product and the cost and time constraints involved, not always about how the product is built. They do have the right to ignore this process and we as testers can learn how to assist in bridging this gap and build market awareness in the team.\n\nWithout understanding the business value a tester provide, or could provide, the tester is simply not reaching his or hers full potential as a professional tester."
