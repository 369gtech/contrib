description: "Technology, like magic, can create a sense of wonder by expanding our notions of what is possible or what is known. Those experiences, striking and visceral, also challenge our sense of causality — suggesting that it can operate beyond our tacit understanding of the world.\n\nKarolina will talk about the role that spectacle and implied logic play in designing interactive installations for public space. Karolina’s projects are situations for the viewer to enter or pass through; the viewer’s behaviour activates a dynamic based on social or perceptual mechanisms that examines how we communicate, interact and apprehend each other and the world.\n\nKarolina Sobecka\nFounder, Flightphase\nhttps://twitter.com/ksobecka\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
