description: "Big Learning Workshop: Algorithms, Systems, and Tools for Learning at Scale at NIPS 2011 \r\nInvited Talk: A Common GPU n-Dimensional Array for Python and C by Arnaud Bergeron\r\n\r\nAbstract: Currently there are multiple incompatible array/matrix/n-dimensional base object implementations for GPUs. This hinders the sharing of GPU code and causes duplicate development work.This paper proposes and presents a first version of a common GPU n-dimensional array(tensor) named GpuNdArray~\\citep{GpuNdArray} that works with both CUDA and OpenCL.It will be usable from python, C and possibly other languages."
