description: "Houdini continues to expand the power and capabilities of CSS. Houdini exposes the parts of the CSS engine that make possible APIs like CSS Grid, Scroll Snap Points, conic gradients, et al. Extend CSS’ capabilities yourself without questionable hacks and better performance. In this talk, we look at the overall structure of the Houdini effort and take a closer look at CSS Paint, Animation Worklets and Custom Layout API. We can get a taste of what the future holds: An ecosystem of modules that bring powerful effects from the shelf to your app.\n\nEVENT:\n\nChrome Dev Summit 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nSurma\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK3OiJvwgSc"
