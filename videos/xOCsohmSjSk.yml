description: "In this lesson we'll discover how to generate from a list multiple html label tags and input type radio. We'll link the label with the input, so that when you click on the label the corresponding input is activated / toggled. We'll also find out how to group multiple input type radio together and we'll create the functionality to be able to reset it. The reset is an html hack, as there is no way to reset an input radio group once a selection has been made with native html.\nOnce the structure is done all all we need is to style it and see the magic happening.\n\n\n## Related videos ##\nCreate Social Media buttons using Custom Icon Font - CodeTap\nhttps://youtu.be/3wsV0tUaD84\n\nYour resume online for free, your CV using HTML5 and CSS3\nhttps://youtu.be/hFMxS9hoswM\n\n\n# Free resources\nW3Schools where you can discover HTML, CSS, JavaScript and more\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/\n\nFree Code Camp - Amazing community where you can test your skills in well prepared challenges\nhttps://www.freecodecamp.org/\n\n# Powered by \nhttp://codetap.io and http://bitbee.uk\n\n### What do you get with CodeTap? ###\nBuild websites and get paid $30,000 and reach as much as $200,000 per year as a senior web developer with or without any knowledge of coding.\n20 years of experience crammed into one master plan will be revealed to you, full of shortcuts to empower you to build websites from day one and learn how to while you do it."
