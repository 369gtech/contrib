description: "Memoization is a technique that allows programs to trade memory usage for improved runtime performance. This is achieved in Haskell by using lazy data structures. However, they should have no effect but to improve the performance making their effectiveness difficult to test and verify. Examples of lazy evaluation, thunks, and the issue of \"space leaks\" will be given.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference and YOW!
