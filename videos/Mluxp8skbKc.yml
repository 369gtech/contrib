description: "With the launch of Android Studio 3.0 comes official support for Kotlin as a first class language for Android development! If you're an AdMob or Doubleclick publisher who's been eager to make the leap to a new language, we've got something else you might like: A bunch of new mobile ads resources to support the Kotlin community.\n\nIn this episode, you'll learn a little more about what sets Kotlin apart, you'll find out what the Mobile Ads Developer Relations team has cooked up to help you integrate AdMob into your own Kotlin apps, and  you'll see screencasts of banner and interstitial implementations that show off time-saving Kotlin features.\n\nWatch more episodes of Mobile Ads Garage here: https://goo.gl/BDQvw6\n\nSubscribe to the Google Developers channel at http://goo.gl/mQyv5L"
