description: "Get your free ticket to EnterpriseNG conference Keynote: https://ng-conf.org\n\nIn this interactive session, we explore a case study on how to use proven domain-driven design principles to make the architecture of your Angular project maintainable in the long term. You also learn how to combine these ideas with best practices from the Angular community.\n\nFirst, we define a strategic and tactical design for our case study, which we then implement with a monorepo that reflects our sub-domains. Then you learn in individual demonstrations how the use of libraries, APIs, facades, domain events, and access rules between libraries can ensure loose coupling and thus better maintainability.\n\nIn the end, you have a case study that you can use as a template for your projects.\n\nWatch all the ng-conf: Hardwired presentations/videos at https://videos.ng-conf.org\n\nng-conf is a three-day Angular conference focused on delivering the highest quality training in the Angular JavaScript framework. 1500+ developers from across the globe converge on Salt Lake City, UT every year to attend talks and workshops by the Angular team and community experts.\n\nng-conf: Hardwired is brought to you by:\n- https://thinkster.io/ The best Angular and JavaScript tutorials on the web\n- https://herodevs.com/ Engineering and consulting by web development experts\n- https://xlts.dev/  Extended support for AngularJS\n\nFollow us on twitter https://twitter.com/ngconf\nOfficial Website: https://www.ng-conf.org/"
