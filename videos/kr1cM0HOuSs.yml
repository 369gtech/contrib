description: "By: Zhon Johansen\n\nWe present a whirlwind tour of Michael Featherâ€™s book â€œWorking Effectively With Legacy Code,â€? showing and discussing specific techniques from the book, with full examples in code. Our intent is to display a variety of different ways to â€œslip testability into the cracksâ€? of existing codebases."
