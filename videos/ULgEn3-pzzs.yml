description: "Kotlin offers great, modern language features and a rich set of extensions. But it's not always obvious to the developer what's happening under the hood. This session will help you understand better what these features and extensions are doing internally. It will also show how you can use the tools that Android offers to find this kind of information on your own.\n\nRomain is the lead of the Android Toolkit team at Google, responsible for the UI Toolkit, Android Jetpack libraries, Jetpack Compose, Filament, etc.Romain has worked on Android since before 1.0 and is passionate about anything graphics or UI related.\n\nChet is the Chief Advocate for Android at Google. He joined the Android team in 2010, led the Toolkit team for several years, and now spends his time helping developers to create better Android applications."
