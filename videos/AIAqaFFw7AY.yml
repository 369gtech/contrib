title: 'Building a Living Style Guide With React with Allan Maltais and Ned Schwartz'

description: "Style guides are a pain! As a static collection of css, colours and html patterns, they are hard to maintain and become outdated easily. There are tools that help in the generation of dynamic style guides, but they often fall to neglect. But what if there was a way to build a style guide that was central to the design, development and testing life-cycles?\n\nIn this talk Allan and Ned will cover the tools and techniques they use at Nulogy to create a shared design language between designers, developer and testers.\n\nYou will see how they use a library of Pure Components, React Storybooks, and CSS Modules to create a portable and reusable toy box of controls that designers can snap together to create UIs.\n\nThey’ll show how they synchronize this sticker book of components with their shared Sketch Symbols library. The result is designs that are consistent, predictable and trivial to implement in code.\n\nIn the end you’ll have an approach to creating and maintaining a style guide that benefits all members of your product team and accelerates collaboration, allowing you to focus on building great interfaces.\n\nAllan Maltais\nProduct Designer, Nulogy\nhttps://twitter.com/allanmaltais\n\nNed Schwartz\nFront-End Developer, Designer, Nulogy\nhttps://twitter.com/theinterned\n\nOn March 4, 2017, FITC hosted another Spotlight event, this time focusing on ReactJS. The event was sponsored and brought to you by Nulogy."
