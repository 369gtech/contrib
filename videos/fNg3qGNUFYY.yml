description: "Презентация и тезисы:\nhttps://phprussia.ru/2019/abstracts/5155\n\nAll developers know that bugs are bad and finding them can be difficult. The good news is tools to help us find and prevent bugs are becoming more powerful...\n\nModern static analysis tools (e.g. IDEs like PHPStorm and tools like Psalm, Phan and PHPStan) are far more advanced than their predecessors. They can find a whole range of bugs whilst keeping the false positive rate low.\n\nThis talk introduces more advanced static analysis. It will show the kinds of bugs that the more advanced static analysis tools can find. We'll then look how they can be added to your current development work flow. We'll finally look at how we can write our code in such a way to get the most out of static analysis.\n\nWherever you are on your static analysis journey this talk will show you the next step.\n-------- \nНашли ошибку в видео?
