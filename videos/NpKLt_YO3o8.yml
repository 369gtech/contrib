Buttons were pressed, videos were played and music was heard, but nobody was really sure what even happened.\n\nThis year, we will be back.\n\nAnd we want to answer the simple question: “How is it made?”. We’ll show you why and how Javascript and a lot of other web-technologies were involved in making an opening performance for jsconf.eu.\n\nFull video of 2017 JSConf opening https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCn-XCASn98"
