description: "Slides: http://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/get-off-the-bus-gus-50-ways-to-leave-your-mainframe\n\nCost of running workloads on the mainframe, lack of skilled personnel, speed of innovation as well as the window of despair between OLTP and Batch processing is leading to enterprises moving their legacy workloads to the cloud. This session will present strategies to replatform and refactor existing mainframe COBOL batch applications to Cloud Foundry. We will provide guidance and best practices in migrating monolithic mainframe apps and data including JCLs wrapped in CICS and IMS using Spring components like Spring Data Flow, Spring Cloud and Spring Batch. \n\nThis session will provide a pathway to migrate thousands of apps trapped on zOS to a 3 rd generation platform. Session we will delve into technologies like iBM Cloud Connect and IBM zOS API Connect that will open the door for mainframe developers to enter the PaaS ecosystem. Enterprises will benefit from a discussion on the role of CF for legacy mainframe workloads.\n\nSpeaker: Rohit Kelapure; Advisory Architect, Pivotal"
