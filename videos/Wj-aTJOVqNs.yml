language: English
recordingDate: 1573736406
description: "Welcome to the weekly challenge. In this challenge, I am going to challenge you to bulk rename files on your hard drive. You will need to change the capitalization scheme for the file names, replace a company name, and even pull a new name for the files out of the files themselves. It should be a lot of fun.\n\nChallenge Page (with solution): https://www.iamtimcorey.com/courses/c-weekly-challenges/lectures/12597794\nSubscribe to Solutions: https://www.iamtimcorey.com/p/c-weekly-challenges\n\nPractice makes perfect, right? Well, mostly, but practice is very important. This series is all about getting you to practice the things you learn. I would encourage you to do every one. See which ones are just easy refreshers and which ones are difficult learning experiences."
