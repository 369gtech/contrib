description: 'Graal is a new just-in-time compiler for the Java Virtual Machine with support for the Truffle polyglot framework. Integrated language runtimes include JavaScript, Ruby, and R. Additionally, it supports LLVM-based languages such as C, C++, Go, and Rust. Graal enables seamless language interoperability while also providing world-class performance for each individual language. A demo will show how JavaScript, Java, Ruby, R, and C can work together in a single web application running in one VM!'
