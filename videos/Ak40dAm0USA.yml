title: '"Flying robots, a wonderful obsession" - Andrew Tridgell (LCA 2021 Online)'
recordingDate: 1612095430
description: "Andrew Tridgell\n\nhttps://lca2021.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/59/\n\nIn this talk I will show the latest updates from the ArduPilot community where we take the obsession with flying robots very seriously. From tiny 100g micro-drones to monsters weighing over a tonne, ArduPilot continues to cover a huge range of aircraft types and uses. Key highlights will include the new AP_Periph system for creating UAVCAN peripherals, a new embedded Lua engine for customisation and a new quadplane landing system.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/\n\nProduced by Next Day Video Australia: https://nextdayvideo.com.au\n\n#linux.conf.au #linux #foss #opensource\n\nMon Jan 25 13:30:00 2021 at Tux Theatre"
