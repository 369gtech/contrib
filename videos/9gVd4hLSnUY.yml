language: English
recordingDate: 1509032933
description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2017\n—\nProgramming your application with Qt means that you will sooner or later encounter the central QObject class, signal & slot connections, or generic properties. The object model makes it safe and easy to develop with components. \n\nIn this session we will take a look at the implementation of these features. For example, how emitting a signal with one line of code results in calling the right slot elsewhere. This is even possible when the sender lives in a different thread than the receiver. In addition, we will learn how reading and writing properties works behind the scenes. \n— \nSimon Hausmann: The Qt Company, Principal Software Engineer\n\nSimon Hausmann is a principal software engineer with The Qt Company and maintainer of the QML library. He has been working on Qt for the past 14 years and continues to enjoy C++. He has contributed to various Qt modules such as the core libraries, the (infamous) meta-object compiler, the text renderer and the web engine.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
