description: "Ryan Cuprak, Analyst, Dassault Systemes\n\nJava has finally shipped with modules! Youâ€™ve attended presentations and read articles about Java 9 modules, but how do you actually go about modularizing an application? This session presents a practical example in which an application is modularized, and it covers application architecture, dependencies, and tooling. Hopefully this will give you a better idea of what is involved in modularizing an application and the benefits it provides."
