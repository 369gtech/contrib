title: 'Krzysztof Magiera - It all starts with navigation'
recordingDate: 1536932480
description: "For the past 2.5 years I've been working on a bunch of projects, all aiming to expose some native capabilities to be controlled from JavaScript in React Native app. Most notable ones were: native driver support for Animated and two libraries: React Native Gesture Handler and Reanimated. All these projects were inspired by needs of navigation libraries and were meant to fill the gap between platform native navigation solutions and ones that are available in React Native.\nOur React Native projects often starts by deciding whether to go with native navigation (react-native-navigation) or JS navigation library (react-navigation). But given all these improvements can we still call react-navigation \"not native\"? In this talk we will learn how Gesture Handler and Reanimated libraries came to live with navigation being the driving force. In this context I will discuss how far is react-navigation from finally proclaiming the badge of really native navigation library.\n\nSlides: https://speakerdeck.com/kmagiera/it-all-starts-with-navigation"
