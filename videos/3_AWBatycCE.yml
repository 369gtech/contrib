title: 'Kurt von Finck interviewed at MySQL 2010'
recordingDate: 1271441420
description: "Kurt von Finck, Chief Community And Communications Officer at Monty\r\nProgram Ab, explains how MariaDB emerged as a superset of MySQL, how\r\nthe company handles project releases, and other development issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMariaDB represents one of the most important MySQL derived projects. While being a drop-in replacement, it incorporates many new features, engines, and bugfixes. If youre a busy DBA with important datasets served by MySQL in a production environment, it behooves you to learn more about MariaDB and assess its value to your infrastructure. MariaDB also encourages outside participation in development, QA, bug reporting, testing, and all facets of project development. So if youre a hacker, a user, or just an interested bystander with unscratched itches in the MySQL codebase, or just a desire to improve MySQL, youll want to learn about how to get involved."
