recordingDate: 1555660971
description: "MvRx is an Android development framework designed at Airbnb. It was designed to make Android development faster, easier, and more fun and it has been a wild success. 93% of the engineers in the pilot rated it an 8/10 or higher and once the pilot ended, it almost immediately became the go-to solution for nearly 100% of new screens from the simplest to the most complex. MvRx is Kotlin first, builds on top of Android Jetpack, and takes the pain out of Android development.\n\nIn just the second half of 2018, literally hundreds of entirely new screens were created with MvRx at Airbnb and 100% of teams that were using React Native have chosen MvRx as their migration path back to native.\n\nWhy has it been so successful and how can it help you? Come join Gabriel Peal talk about MvRx and what makes it so practical and effective in the real world.\n\nhttps://github.com/airbnb/MvRx"
