description: 'Improved compiler’s ability to infer types of local variables based on the surrounding context is undoubtedly the biggest language feature in Java 10, further extended in Java 11, which affects all Java developers. When used correctly, it can lead to better developer experience by reducing the ceremony associated with writing Java, thus creating cleaner code. In this live-coding session, we will explain how type inference in Java works, and examine its limitations on more than a dozen of examples. We push the limits of type inference by putting it in situations involving generic and anonymous classes, and show how the feature can not only make your code more readable, but surprisingly also change its semantics. We will conclude by providing a set of best practices and guidelines for using type inference in a way that creates clean code. Target audience: expert'
