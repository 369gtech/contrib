description: 'Projects that don’t change are the ones that get canceled. Any relevant and useful software has to continuously evolve. Agile development greatly emphasizes an evolutionary approach to design and architecture. That’s because big up-front design and architecture are risky. But the evolutionary approach also has risks. This session starts with a quick discussion of why to employ an evolutionary approach and the risks of doing it or not doing it. Then it looks at some very concrete key practices that can lead us successfully on the path of evolutionary development.'
