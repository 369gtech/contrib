title: 'Innovating Faster with Continuous Application Security'
language: English
recordingDate: 1538632856
description: "Integration, delivery, and deployment are continuous. The threat is continuous. But application security is largely manual, time consuming, and error prone. Application security has become the primary bottleneck in the software pipeline. Simply automating the process of running legacy scanning tools ignores the technical, process, and cultural differences between security and development. In this talk, we'll explore what organizations can do to achieve Continuous Application Security (CAS). CAS breaks down monolithic scanning processes into specific verifications that can run continuously and accurately as part of the normal development process. And CAS also enables timely response to new attacks and vulnerabilities that emerge in both custom code and third party components. Ultimately CAS helps development and security work together effectively, enabling them to create, deploy, and operate applications faster and more securely.\n\nSpeakers:\nJeff Williams\nCo-Founder and CTO, Contrast Security\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
