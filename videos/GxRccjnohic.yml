description: "For most of us - working from home is a new reality imposed by COVID-19. However, Tamar Rucham has a 6 years head start on working & promoting her career remotely.\nSix years ago Tamar moved back to Israel and started working remotely. It was a scary move on several levels, but one of the things she wondered was - how will I grow my career working remotely? In those six years, she worked as a freelancer, found an all remote position with GoDaddy, got promoted to engineering manager, and eventually left to build her own startup - all remote.\n\nIn this talk, Tamar will share her lessons learned: the benefits and unique career growth opportunities when working remotely, how to go about finding a remote job and interview remotely and how to get noticed in a remote environment. Feel free to bring your own questions regarding remote work and remote career growth!\n\nBio: CEO & Founder @ ParentScheduler\nAfter working as a Software Engineer and Engineering manager for over a decade, Tamar decided to set out on the adventure of building her own startup. Throughout her career she has worked with a variety of programming languages and technology stacks, different company sizes and markets, all led her to discover that her real passion is about how her code affects people's lives. In addition to programming, she likes to read, knit, and rock climb (in a gym ;)."
