description: "https://cppcon.org/\nhttps://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2020\n---\nThe Taskflow project addresses the long-standing question: \"How can we make it easier for developers to write parallel and heterogeneous programs with high performance and simultaneous high productivity?\" Modern scientific computing relies on a heterogeneous mix of computational patterns, domain algorithms, and specialized hardware to achieve key scientific milestones that go beyond traditional capabilities. However, programming these applications often requires complex expert-level tools and a deep understanding of software methodologies. Specifically, the lack of a suitable software environment that can overcome the complexity of programming large parallel and heterogeneous systems has posed a significant barrier for many organizations to facilitate transformational discoveries.\n\nTaskflow develops a simple and powerful task programming model to enable efficient implementations of heterogeneous decomposition strategies. Our programming model empowers users with both static and dynamic task graph constructions to incorporate a broad range of computational patterns including hybrid CPU-GPU computing, dynamic control flow, and irregularity. We develop an efficient heterogeneous work-stealing strategy that adapts worker threads to available task parallelism at any time during the graph execution. We have demonstrated promising performance of Taskflow on both micro-benchmark and real-world applications. As an example, we solved a large machine learning workload by up to 1.5× faster, 1.6× less memory, and 1.7× fewer lines of code than two industrial-strength systems, oneTBB and StarPU, on a machine of 40 CPUs and 4 GPUs.\n\nThis talk will cover three aspects: (1) heterogeneous task programming model using modern C++, (2) an efficient work-stealing strategy generalizable to arbitrary heterogeneous domains, and (3) user experience we have obtained and suggested roadmap for C++ in face of future heterogeneity.\n\nThe Taskflow project is available at https://taskflow.github.io/\n\n---\nAs a university faculty member, a central theme of my research is to make parallel computing easier to handle. I am passionate about using modern C++ technology to solve parallel and heterogeneous computing problems. One such effort is my Taskflow project (https://taskflow.github.io/), A General-purpose Parallel and Heterogeneous Task Programming System using Modern C++, which I developed to help developers quickly write parallel and heterogeneous programs with high performance and simultaneous high productivity.\n\n---\nStreamed & Edited by Digital Medium Ltd - events.digital-medium.co.uk\nevents@digital-medium.co.uk"
