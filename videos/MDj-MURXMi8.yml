description: "STRUCTS FOR ORDER\nby Andrey Chernykh\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nElixir\nStructs\nDDD\n\nTALK LEVEL: Beginner / intermediate\n\nABSTRACT\nHave you ever reviewed code written by Elixir-newcomers and noticed that some of them avoid Structs? Maybe ‘avoid’ is the wrong word, but Andrey has witnessed a lack of Structs usage. In most cases that usage ends up with Ecto models, but there are a lot of places in a Phoenix application (or just an Elixir console application) where Structs might be very helpful.\n\nThrough this talk, Andrey shows the value of Structs and how they are related to an application's domain model as elementary entities that define data contracts and are responsible for this data validation and handling.\n\nLearn more in Andrey's article: https://medium.com/coingaming/elixir-structs-for-the-order-5c45be57c5c9\n\n- Read the full abstract: http://bit.ly/2RHTbD8\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - ANDREY CHERNYKH\nElixir developer at Coingaming\n\nAndrey started as C# developer more than 10 years ago, with C# he took the path from junior developer to team lead position. After doing enterprise stuff, Andrey switched to Ruby. Andrey had been working with Ruby on various projects for years when he decided to add new programming language for concurrent, distributed systems into the toolbox. \n\nHe considered Scala, Go, Erlang ... and finally noticed Elixir. Elixir made the same wow-effect as Ruby when Andrey had first switched to it from C#. Andrey had found what he'd been searching for! \n\nAndrey works with Elixir on a daily basis and has done so for the past two years. Andrey's created a number of services which work in production, he contributes to open source (exop, express and other), writes articles on Medium and enjoys Elixir every single day. Andrey is very keen on clean, maintainable code and the DDD principle.\n\n- More on Andrey Chernykh: http://bit.ly/2RHTbD8\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE ELIXIR LDN 18\nCode BEAM Lite Berlin 18 was co-organised by Bitcrowd and Code Sync.\n\nBITCROWD\n- Website: https://bitcrowd.net/\n- Twitter: https://twitter.com/bitcrowd\n- Mail: info at bitcrowd.net\n\nCODE SYNC \n- Website: www.codesync.global\n- Twitter: www.twitter.com/CodeElixirIO\n- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/CodeSyncGlobal\n- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/code-sync/\n- Mail: info at codesync.global\n\n#CBLBerlin #Elixir #CodeSync #Structs"
