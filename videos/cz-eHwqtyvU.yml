description: "Benchmarking Cloud Native Databases Performance on Kubernetes - Iqbal Farabi & Tara Baskara, GO-JEK \n\nCNCF defines cloud native technologies as, \"technologies that empower organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern and dynamic environments. Cloud native technologies enable loosely coupled systems that are resilient, manageable, and observable”.  According to Kubernetes Application Survey 2018, SQL and NoSQL databases are the second and third most deployed types of software deployed to Kubernetes. However, currently there are only few benchmarking results available on cloud native databases as per CNCF definition.  Therefore, in this talk, we will present our findings on experiments to benchmark various cloud native databases such as Vitess, CockroachDB, FoundationDB, TiDB and YugaByte DB. The experiments try to benchmark scalability and elasticity of each databases when they’re running on Kubernetes. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPfe"
