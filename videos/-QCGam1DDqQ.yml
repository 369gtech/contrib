title: '[VDT19] What would you do with 10^6 cores? High Performance Computing in the AWS Cloud by Frank Munz'
language: English
recordingDate: 1570813032
description: "This talk presents the technical innovations that make HPC in the cloud possible. I will cover everything from the best of class custom build Intel processors to low energy, low cost ARM processors that silently sneaked into server-class machines. I will speak about purpose build networking that bypasses the TCP/IP stack to guarantee lowest latency, low jitter networking beyond what is possible with classical NICs. And I will cover the open source software that makes it possible to spin up very large scale HPC clusters in the cloud.\n\nOh, and of course I will answer the question if 1.000.000 cores is pure marketecture or if it really happened. Of course it really happened."
