title: 'SOLID Principles for Cloud Native Containers by Bilgin Ibryam'
language: English
recordingDate: 1510260669
description: "The way we design, develop and run applications on cloud-native platforms such as Kubernetes differs significantly from the traditional application runtimes. When working with Kubernetes, there are fewer concerns for developers to think about, but at the same time, there are new primitives and patterns for solving every-day challenges. In this talk, we will describe a number of principles that represent foundational guidelines that containerized applications must comply with in order to become a cloud-native citizen. Following these rules will ensure that your containerized applications are suitable for automation in cloud-native platforms.\n\n# Bilgin Ibryam\nBilgin Ibryam (@bibryam) is a Senior Architect at Red Hat and committer at Apache for Camel, OFBiz and Isis projects.
