description: "Java EE containers, OSGI containers, can quite easily undeploy and deploy applications at runtime for an upgrade or other various reasons. But you don’t need this. Immutable Infrastructure (II) – the pattern that perfectly fits modern microservice requirements.\n\nDuring this talk we will cover:\n\n– Immutable Infrastructure concept overview.\n– Separation of Data and Code – separation of concerns.\n– Java code requirements for II.\n– Continuous Deployment upgrade models. Pros and cons.\n– II toolsets on GCE, AWS, Openstack and your notebook."
