recordingDate: 1557111000
description: "\"Speaker: Terri Oda\n\nWhile high-level security concepts may transcend languages, each language has its own sets of tools and edge cases that are worth knowing.  Python is one of many popular languages that is rarely the focus in security training, but that doesn't mean python code is automatically secure (no matter what the internet tells you).  Learn why people who say “pylint will help you with security” aren’t doing you any favours, how to use Bandit for security-focused linting and talk about other options for static analysis.  Take a deeper look at why scanning for publicly known vulnerabilities is complicated, and how to use Pyup Safety to make it easier.  We’ll also explore some language myths and best practices.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2019 and https://github.com/PyCon/2019-slides\""
