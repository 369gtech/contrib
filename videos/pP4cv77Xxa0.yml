description: "In days past, application deployments were often riddled with tight bindings to infrastructure specifics (that is, host names), a practice that does not work in the cloud. This session takes an application initially targeted for a noncloud deployment and makes (a few) modifications (mostly to config) to get it running in the cloud. The presentation shows you how to use the Spring Cloud project to configure the deployment, how to leverage a cloud services catalog, how to implement a cross-site scripting solution (and why), and how to do session state caching, and it discusses (the dangers of) autoreconfiguration. The session provides a very pragmatic, hands-on approach to understanding application architectures in the cloud.\n\n\nAuthor:\nCornelia Davis\nA self-proclaimed propeller head, Cornelia Davis works as a Platform Engineer in the Cloud Foundry group of Pivotal.
