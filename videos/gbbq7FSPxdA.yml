description: "The frequency and impact of recent high-profile breaches has been positively depressing. Besides the increasing number of incidents themselves, there’s been a growing phalanx of security vendors clamoring to sell us stuff (we don’t need) and promising to solve our problems (while sometimes making them worse). It’s a security nihilist’s dream, and despair seems like a reasonable option.\n\nHowever, a new type of security engineering is taking root, which suggests hope for effective corporate security at enterprise scale. Haroon Meer highlights these hopeful examples in a bid to encourage more people to plot a course toward achievable security.\n\nSubscribe to O'Reilly on YouTube: http://goo.gl/n3QSYi\n\nFollow O'Reilly on: \nTwitter: http://twitter.com/oreillymedia\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/OReilly\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/oreillymedia\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/8459/"
