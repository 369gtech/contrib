description: "A Smooth Path to Cloud Foundry on Containers [B] - Jan von Löwenstein, SAP    \n\nCloud Foundry (CF) has been running apps in containers from the beginning. However, CF itself is deployed with BOSH on virtual machines. At the same time, we see more and more \nservices outside of CF being deployed on container platforms, such as Mesos or Kubernetes. \n\nWe love BOSH, but apparently, container schedulers have advantages over VMs.\nHow do you deploy a CF based product with additional services on Kubernetes?\nOthers want to take BOSH out of the equation.\nWe want to preserve it.\nThus, we take a more evolutionary than revolutionary approach.\n\nIn this talk, we show how to deploy regular BOSH releases without modifications using a naive Kubernetes CPI https://github.com/SAP/bosh-kubernetes-cpi-release. We discuss the obstacles we encountered on the way and the current limitations of the CPI. Furthermore, we would like to start a discussion about how to evolve BOSH to overcome some of the current limitations and make container platforms just another deployment choice.\n\nJan von Löwenstein\nSAP SE\nSenior Developer\njan.von.loewenstein@sap.com\nTwitter Tweet\nJan von Loewenstein is a developer on the BOSH OpenStack CPI project.
