description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2018\n—\nSmart references (aka \"operator dot overloading\") and Unified Call Syntax, it would be great if C++ supported both of them out of the box. Despite community requests, dating back from the 90s, the many proposals to add them to the language have been rejected. Therefore, we will have to wait until the arrival of a proposal that does succeed. \n\nOr should we? Not if you use my smartref library, a modern header-only zero-overhead library for creating smart references. Last year at CppCon2017, I was awarded the jury's first prize for my poster about the library, because of its high quality and innovation in the presented approach. Now, one year later, I've gained many new insights, and would like to share them with all of you. \n\nIn this talk, I will show you some compelling examples of problems my library can solve in a very elegant way. Secondly, I will walk you through the design of the library, and show how tricky adding support for the most trivial operations turns out to be. Finally, I will show some unexpected possibilities of the library that I didn't initially foresee. For example, the Unified Call Syntax, which allows you to call free functions, using a member function syntax. Come to my talk, and be inspired by the new building blocks we can already create using existing C++. \n— \nErik Valkering, Plaxis BV\nSoftware Engineer\n\nErik Valkering has always been very interested in programming. Already at the age of 11, he was introduced to QuickBasic via a friend of his. During high school, he tried varying languages, like Visual Basic, Pascal, and Assembly, but eventually fell in love with C++. After high school, he did a Bachelor in Computer Science at the Hogeschool van Amsterdam, while working as a part time software developer at TNR Software. After graduating cum laude, he obtaining a MSc in Computer Science from the Delft University of Technology. After working for 8 years at TNR Software, he decided it was time to move on, and was hired as a software engineer at Plaxis BV. \n\nAt Plaxis, he is the product owner within a team of software engineers and geotechnical quality assurance engineers. At his work and during his free time, he's always interested in using the state-of-the-art in software engineering, and especially Modern C++. For several (hobby) projects, he already \nmanaged to crash the compiler, resulting in those uninformative 'Internal compiler error' messages. If you get those, you know you're doing bleeding-edge stuff :) \n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
