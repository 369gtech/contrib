See http://fitc.ca for details.\n\nOverview\nAngular 2 is a powerful framework that lets you create fast and scalable web apps with clean and readable code. With the lessons learned from previous web frameworks and the advantages of modern web technologies, the Angular team has created a framework that will push the limits of what SPAs are capable of.\n\nIn this session we’ll go through building an Angular 2.0 app from the ground up. In the process, you will learn how it handles core concepts like components, templates, services, and routing. You’ll also see how angular takes advantage of ES6 modules, Web Components, and TypeScript. By the end of the session, you’ll have a good understanding of why you might want to use Angular 2 for your next project and how to get started.\n\nRob McDiarmid\nFull-Stack Developer, Konrad Group\nhttps://twitter.com/RobIanMcd\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
