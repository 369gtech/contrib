description: "Javascript is ubiquitous, but can it solve real though problems? The traveling saleman problem is a notoriously hard problem to do efficiently (I.e nobody knows how). In this talk we combine art and craft and put JavaScript to the test. We will let JavaScript solve a TSP problem which results in a rendition of the Mona Lisa.\n\nFor reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
