description: "All You Need is Pandas: Unexpected Success Stories\n[EuroPython 2018 - Talk - 2018-07-25 - Fintry [PyData]]\n[Edinburgh, UK]\n\nBy Dimiter Naydenov\n\nLearning to use the awesome Pandas toolkit helped me immensely in lots of ways. Finding novel,\nefficient solutions to complex day-to-day problems with Pandas not only saves time, but can be fun\nand rewarding experience.\n\nIn this talk I'll present use cases I had to solve, but the \"traditional\" approach proved tough\nand/or otherwise frustrating implement nicely. Since I was just starting to learn Pandas, decided to\ntry an alternative solution with it. What I learned changed the way I think about data processing\nwith Python, and it only got better since!\n\nThe use cases deals with extracting pen strokes from handwritten SVG samples, and recomposing them\ninto reusable letters and numbers. When you need to compare each stroke to all others, often more\nthan once, resulted in inefficient, slow, and hard to maintain code. Even a naive Pandas approach\nwith loops helped to reduce both the memory footprint, and improve the performance considerably!\nImproving the implementation further, vectorizing inner loops, and taking advantage of multi-index\noperations, I managed to get the same results, using less memory and a lot faster (by orders of\nmagnitude).\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2018.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
