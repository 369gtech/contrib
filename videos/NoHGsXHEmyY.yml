description: "Frederick Knight and Sridhar Balasubramanian, NetApp\n\nA non-volatile DIMM (NVDIMM) is a Dual In-line Memory Module (DIMM) that maintains the contents of Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (SDRAM) during power loss. An NVDIMM-N class of device can be integrated into a standard compute or storage platforms to provide non-volatility of the data in DIMM. NVDIMM relies on byte addressable energy backed function to preserve the data in case of power failure. A Byte Address Energy Backed Function is backed by a combination of SDRAM and non-volatile memory (e.g., NAND flash) on the NVDIMM-N. JESD245C Byte-Addressable Energy Backed Interface (BAEBI) defines the programming interface for NVDIMM-N class of devices.\n\nAn NVDIMM-N achieves non-volatility by:\n\nperforming a Catastrophic Save operation to copy SDRAM contents into NVM when host power is lost using an Energy Source managed by either the module or the host\nperforming a Restore operation to copy contents from the NVM to SDRAM when power is restored\nAn NVDIMM-N device may be a of self-encrypting device (SED) type that protects data at rest. This means the NVDIMM-N controller:\n\nencrypts data during a Catastrophic Save operation\ndecrypts data during a Restore operation and the data is:\nplaintext while sitting in SDRAM\nciphertext while sitting in NVM (e.g., flash memory)\nTypically, an NVDIMM-N device may be used within the storage controller for performance acceleration against storage workloads or as a sundry storage to preserve debug information in case of power failure. When NVDIMM-N device is used as a caching layer, transient data is staged in NVDIMM-N device before the data is persisted/committed to the storage media. NVDIMM-N devices are also used as persistent storage media for staging memory dump files when critical failures occur at storage subsystem level before the system goes down.\n\nThe NVDIMM-N encryption standardization proposal involves cross-pollination between JEDEC (proposed BAEBI extensions to define security protocols in conjunction with encryption capability on the device) and TCG standards (proposed TCG Storage Interface Interactions Specifications content for handling self-encrypting NVDIMM-Ns plus adapting TCG Ruby SSC for NVDIMM-N devices) with industry sponsorship from HPE and NetApp.\n\nThe talk will begin with brief overview of NVDIMM-N device and associated storage-centric use cases followed by an overview of NVDIMM-N encryption scheme, and proposed self-encrypting device standardization approach for NVDIMM-N devices, which involves the following:\n\nExtensions to BAEBI specification to accommodate security protocol definitions in consequence with encryption capability in NVDIMM-N devices\nExtensions to TCG Storage Interface Specifications defining the Security Protocol Typed Block for handling interactions with NVDIMM-N devices\nAdapting TCG Ruby SSC standard for accommodating NVDIMM-N class devices\nThe talk will conclude by summarizing current state of the standardization proposal and approval process with JEDEC and TCG WG's.\n\nView the full Vault '19 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/vault19/program"
