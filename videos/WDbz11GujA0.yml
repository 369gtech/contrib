description: "Data Service Automation for Cloud Foundry on Kubernetes - Julian Fischer, anynines GmbH \n\nFor more info: https://www.cloudfoundry.org/ \n\nRunning Cloud Foundry on Kubernetes implies that the lifecycle management tool BOSH becomes obsolete. A reason to look at the future of data service automation for Cloud Foundry. In this session you will learn how the entire lifecycle of on-demand provisioning data services can be automated to serve thousands of data service instances of various types. An open source data service framework covering large swathes of the lifecycle automation will be drafted. See how existing technologies such as Operators and Helm can be of use. Furthermore see how the integration with both Kubernetes CRDs and the Open Service Broker API can be combined. At the end of this session you will have gained a conceptual understanding of how to automate stateful workloads for future Cloud Foundry environments."
