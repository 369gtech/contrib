The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nSponsored Session: AWS Controllers for Kubernetes -- The AWS API Universe Now Kubeified! - Jay Pipes, AWS \n\nHave you ever wanted to use the Kubernetes API and configuration language to create an AWS S3 Bucket? Frustrated having to use different tools to configure your Kubernetes application and your application's dependencies like RDS DB instances or SNS Topics?  Well, AWS Controllers for Kubernetes (ACK) is what you've been looking for. It bridges the worlds of the AWS service APIs and Kubernetes, allowing Kubernetes users to create and manage AWS resources using the Kubernetes API and resource model.  Come learn how ACK is designed, what you can do with it, how you can contribute to this open source project and how ACK components and code generation can form the foundation of other Kubernetes ecosystem projects that interact with AWS APIs. \n\nhttps://sched.co/f6jw"
