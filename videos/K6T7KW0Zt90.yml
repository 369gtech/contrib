description: 'In the late summer of 2011 Ancestry.com became the first Private Chef (now Enterprise Chef) customer complete with a 51-page custom-written contract! The minute we saw Chef we knew it was a game changer. Already on the path towards continuous delivery, we needed a configuration management solution and Chef filled this most critical piece of our continuos delivery/devops tool chain. Ultimately, Chef has become the tool having the most impact across our entire infrastructure. Without Chef we would not have been able to accomplish what we have and it continues to be key as we forge new ground. Our Chef story has all the elements of an epic quest complete with heroes, villains, loyal sidekicks, magical beasts, and mystical artifacts. Come hear the story and the lessons learned that can help you succeed on your own Chef journey.'
