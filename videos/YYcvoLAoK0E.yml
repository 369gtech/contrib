description: "Building experiences for virtual and augmented reality is an unexplored and uncharted territory for many developers. As the technology matures and devices start to reach homes around the world, there is a huge demand for content. What many developers do not realise is that you don’t need to build a whole mobile app or spend lots of money on a big VR system. People everywhere already own capable devices - their smartphone and mobile browser! This presentation will show how virtual and augmented reality experiences can be developed for the mobile browser and run inexpensively on VR headsets like Google Cardboard (as well as be compatible with headsets like the Oculus Rift too!).\n\nPatrick is focused on exploring and sharing the possibilities of new technology such as the Internet of Things, virtual/augmented reality and wearables. He is the founder of devdiner.com, a new hub for developers to keep track of emerging tech. He is a SitePoint contributing editor, a SitePoint Premium and O’Reilly instructor, a Meta Pioneer and freelance web developer who loves every opportunity to tinker with something new in a tech demo.\n\nFor more on YOW!
