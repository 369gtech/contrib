title: 'Philippe Trepanier - Automate your React Native world with fastlane'
recordingDate: 1536920893
description: "Coming from the web world, building iOS and Android apps are a pain.It takes time, there are a ton of different tools or services to use and jump between to get to the end point and it is just a loss of time that could be used to fix that weird UI element you did not have the time to finish, or that code that hasnâ€™t been tested but really should be. Thankfully, fastlane is here to help us and makes it incredibly easy to automate Android and iOS builds, deployment, screenshots and far more. This talk will present how to get started and build and deploy a React-native project to Testflight (iOS) and the Android Play store beta track and will present in more details a subset of the tools provided by fastlane.\n\nThis talk was presented at React Native EU 2017, September 6-7, Wroclaw, Poland."
