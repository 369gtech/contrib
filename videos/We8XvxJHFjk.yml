description: "Do you ever feel anxious when you are about to push to the Git repository? What is the worst thing that can happen? What if your or someone else lives would be at risk? Would you still push it? In this talk, I will show you how the Swedish Motorcycle organization uses Agile principles to create a safe environment for their members to educate and develop their driving skills. I will draw an analogy with the sort of environment that I try to set up for our development teams to enable them to develop at 300 km/h.\n\nOve Lindström, One Agency Sweden AB\nOve is an software architect with a taste for agile development, fast motorcycles, rapid change, coaching and constant improvement. He works at One Agency as a consultant with cloud architecture, Continuous Delivery, Clean Code coaching and whatever else he finds fun at the moment.\n\nRecorded at Jfokus 2018\nhttps://www.jfokus.se/jfokus18/schedule.jsp"
