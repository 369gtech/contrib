description: 'I spend most of my terminal time in bash and vim, so little slowdowns in either disproportionately drain my time and energy. Since mid-2019, I have smoothed over warts in those tools by creating new shortcuts and by learning more about what the software already offers! Users of any Unix-like environment will find something they can use in this collection of bash, git, vim, and command-line tips. Attendees will learn new ways to decrease their frustration and increase their productivity. -Ofun!'
