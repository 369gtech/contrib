description: "Reinventing Networking: A Deep Dive into Istio's Multicluster Gateways - Steve Dake, Independent \n\nService mesh software is challenging the current networking state of the art. With Istioâ€™s gateways technology, it is possible to connect large numbers of Kubernetes clusters. Connectivity between clouds enables cloud native applications to connect across cloud providers on the global Internet.    In this session, attendees will receive:  * An introduction to multicluster service mesh technology  * A technical deep dive describing how crucial technical problems with multicluster are solved including:  - Multicluster service discovery  - Transparent multicluster connectivity  - Secure connectivity over the insecure Internet  - Multicluster routing  * Detailed explanations of how CoreDNS and Envoy are consumed as building blocks    Finally, the attendees will receive a short demonstration of an application running seamlessly on AWS, Azure, and GKE using Istio gateway multicluster technology. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPbL"
