description: "Tribes, communities of practice, organizations, and societies accrete symbolic systems that forge a common language over time to accomplish tasks usually related to the preservation, extension of power, and access to resources needed to continue to flourish and allow the social graph within boundaries to feel a sense of agency and empowerment. Indeed, when one group or tribe within a larger ecosystem feels threatened or produces radical new ideas, the heretical rebels leverage common metaphors, symbols, and tactics to achieve strategic goals - at first rebelling against the existing power structure (writing manifestos, throwing maltov cocktails), supplanting the existing “high priests”, and eventually developing the same rituals that previous power structure utilized to maintain and extend it’s power base - the heretics eventually become the high priests of a new caste system and then anoint their own saints.\n\nWe have seen this evolution in social systems and the accretion of cultural norms in the context of IT in general and software design and development in particular. Clifford Geertz said, “that man is an animal suspended in webs of significance he himself has spun, I take culture to be those webs.” What we must understand is that with each new ideologically principled-based movement within IT, from RUP to Agile, to Lean Software, to LeanUX, DevOps, and more recently Lean Startup, is that each new ideologically based tribe has the need to extend it’s power base beyond the context for which it was originally intended. Even if each ideology with methods and practices made sense at a given time and place, does not necessarily mean it’s appropriate or strategic from a systems, wholistic, societal perspective.\n\nThis is important in making strategic decisions from an enterprise perspective in terms of which ideology to deploy, how to allocate resources, and how to ensure that across the portfolio of potential ‘bets’ the appropriate methods are deployed. This tension - between tribes that wish to enjoy greater agency by proselytizing their ideology and methods into other domains, and the needs of the organization, which seeks balance across multiple competing factions to actually achieve enterprise-wide goals, is the primary challenge faced by leaders.\n\nWe’ll explore the fractal nature of tribal-methods and seek to understand the various roles, practices, methods, and principles that are either local-optima or more global to seek to provide a framework for decision-making in uncertain and turbulent times. We’ll unpack the relationship between different horizons from exploration to exploitation work, and provide some heuristics for when things like Design thinking or LeanUX are most appropriate, and when Agile or ITIL frameworks might be the most authentic satisficing lens through which to make decisions."
