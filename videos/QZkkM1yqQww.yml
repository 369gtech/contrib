title: 'YOW! Nights 2017 Svetlana Isakova -  You Can Do it better with Kotlin'
recordingDate: 1510231455
description: "This YOW! Night is devoted to the Kotlin programming language. It’s a modern language that gives more power in everyday routines and is gaining popularity amongst the Java developer community.\n\nKotlin code generally looks cleaner and nicer, and it’s much easier to work with when you have less verbosity or code duplication. But what’s even more important, is that Kotlin is 100% compatible with all existing Java frameworks, and has good tooling (it’s from JetBrains after all).\n\nOur agenda for the night consists of three parts:\n\nIntroduction to the language\nIntroduction to Kotlin Coroutines\nPractical sides of Java interop\nAt first, we’ll discuss what makes Kotlin so attractive to developers and cover the most important features of the language. Then, we’ll talk about coroutines, a new powerful feature, that changes your habits of writing asynchronous code. The last part is aimed mainly at people who already have some experience with Kotlin and dives into some internals of mixing Java and Kotlin code in one project.\n\nSvetlana is a Developer Advocate at JetBrains. She’s been a core developer of the Kotlin language (http://kotlinlang.org/) , the new standard for Android, since 2011. She is a co-author of Kotlin in Action. She is also a frequent Kotlin speaker and instructor. Svetlana enjoys new concepts and ideas, and when possible skiing in the Alps.\n\nFor more information on YOW!
