description: "We're going to use Udacity's car simulator app as an environment to create our own autonomous agent! We'll use Keras to train a convolutional neural network on images from the car's cameras as well as steering angles from human driving. Using just those 2 data points, it'll be able to drive itself on any road. \n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/How_to_simulate_a_self_driving_car\n\nMore Learning resources:\nhttps://hackernoon.com/five-skills-self-driving-companies-need-8546d2aba7c1\nhttp://nicolovaligi.com/reading-list-udacity-self-driving-challenge-3.html\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/pulse/teaching-car-how-drive-using-deep-learning-muhieddine-el-kaissi\nhttp://selfdrivingcars.mit.edu/\nhttp://blog.davidsingleton.org/nnrccar/\nhttps://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/lecture/zYS8T/autonomous-driving\nhttps://www.udacity.com/drive\n\nJoin us in the Wizards Slack channel:\nhttp://wizards.herokuapp.com/\n\nAnd please support me on Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/user?u=3191693\nFollow me:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/sirajraval\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/sirajology Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/sirajraval/ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/sirajraval/"
