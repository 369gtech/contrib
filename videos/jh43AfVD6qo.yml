description: "Reviewing code can feel like a secondary task. Discussing code can be easy though, if you leave out syntax details. Following a couple of guide lines for pull requests can make code reviewing much easier. Some code style rules can drastically reduce the mental overhead needed to understand code changes. Furthermore this talk will give some general guidelines on how to give feedback on PRs as a peer developer or coworker. These rules are not to keep for yourself, share them with your peers and your life will get easier.\n\nEVENT:\n\nPHP UK Conference 2017\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nHannes Van De Vreken\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nThe original video was published on PHP UK Conference YouTube channel with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nPHP UK Conference YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX06sx2WWYGny7b3XDUyFCQ\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C087UCUkVLc"
