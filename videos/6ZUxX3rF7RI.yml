description: "What are the security aspects of implementing a IoT solution? Where and by who will all of these new systems be used, and for what purposes, other than the \"first\" use case? \n\nThe recent news of hacks of SIM-card manufacturer Gemalto and other base level firmware has led to an interesting discussion and awareness online of how secure our new devices are and needs to be going forward. \n\nAs Johan Strömhage, CEO of Purple Scout, said at the first meetup; there will probably be one or two major crashes regarding IoT before we get things right. IoT Security will definitely be one of those things.\n\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry in the Malmö/Lund region. Foo Café is aimed at those interested in sharing, learning and creating. \nJoin the fun at foocafe.org"
