We live in a task-oriented world and with technology becoming less visible (due to good design), we are well on our way to creating experiences that the mass audience can consume. How do we make technology less visible? What kind of design results in new physical behaviours? Why is this important for the future? These are some of the questions I'm going to have a go at tackling.\n\nAbout Antony: https://twitter.com/ribotmaximus\nAbout Mobilism: https://mobilism.nl"
