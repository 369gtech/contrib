title: 'Conversational AI and human agents working together'
language: English
recordingDate: 1589740208
description: "Many customer care systems combine conversational AI with live agents. Users may want to talk to a live agent either because the bot does not understand the user (AI limitation), or the request cannot be automated and requires a human action (application-specific limitation). In this session, we cover an overall approach to \"human in the loop\". We will show you how to build bots that combine conversational AI and human agents for delightful customer experiences.\n\nLearn More: \nCreate a new LUIS app https://aka.ms/LUISBuild2020\n\nThe AI Show's Favorite links:\nDon't miss new episodes, subscribe to the AI Show   https://aka.ms/aishowsubscribe\nCreate a Free account (Azure)  https://aka.ms/aishow-seth-azurefree"
