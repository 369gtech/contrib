title: 'Tackling Dreaded .Net Cold Starts When Going Serverless - Sarjeel Yusuf'
recordingDate: 1573134172
description: "Out of all the runtimes that AWS natively supports, .NET experiences the worst performance regarding cold starts. Developers using .NET are reluctant to take up serverless in a time when serverless is on the rise, threatening the relevance of .NET in ever-evolving software.\n\nHowever, there are solutions specifically tailored for .NET, to overcome cold starts. Implementing these solutions warrant the need to understand the serverless architecture and .NET paradigms to realize where it all goes wrong. Only then can we devise impactful solutions to reduce cold starts and, ideally, even eliminate them completely.\n\nAt the moment, there are no easily accessible and comprehensive resources discussing the issue. Solutions to the .NET cold start problem are scattered across forums and opinion pages. This session aims at presenting a well-researched insight into the problem, and extensively tested solutions.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks, courses, and conferences in the following links:\nhttps://ndcsydney.com/\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
