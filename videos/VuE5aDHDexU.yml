Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nEvery way we DDoSed our Cortex - Goutham Veeramachaneni, Grafana Labs \n\nCortex is a distributed version of Prometheus with a lot of moving parts. We have a pretty good getting started guide with enough information to get a working cortex cluster that can ingest data and answer queries. But there is limited material on the day 2 operations: Capacity planning, query performance debugging, and general health monitoring. In this talk, we will take you through the debugging workflow, the typical knobs that should be tweaked for optimal performance, the mixin for cortex that covers the dashboards and alerts, and in general how to approach debugging and maintaining an existing cortex cluster. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UagC"
