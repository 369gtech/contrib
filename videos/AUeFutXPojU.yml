description: "At Wooga we are creating the next generation of social games. To be truly social, a game needs to offer real interaction between players in different forms. \n\nTaking one of our upcoming games as an example we will present the state synchronization used in client and server, how we do real time communication without websockets and how we are making a backend scalable enough to support millions of users every day. We will also share secrets about our prototypes for first person and real time strategy games.\n\nThe Erlang process model with evented IO, asynchronous messaging, links and isolation fits very well to real time multiplayer games. Come to our talk to see how it's used to build a very successful business. \n\n\n\n\nLiked the song? It's \"Tank\" by Seatbelts"
