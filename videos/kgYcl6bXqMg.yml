description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nInside Kubernetes Networking - Dominik Tornow, Cisco\n\nKubernetes Networking is a core abstraction of Kubernetes: At the core, the Kubernetes Networking Model guarantees that all Kubernetes Pods on a cluster can communicate. On top of the Kubernetes Network Model, Kubernetes provides additional core abstractions, most notably Kubernetes Services and Kubernetes Ingress. Although K8s Networking is an essential aspect of every K8s Cluster and by extension every K8s Application, even experienced K8s users struggle to reason about K8s Networking end-to-end. Using a systems modeling approach, this presentation will provide a holistic mental model of K8s Networking - integrating Pod-to-Pod communication, Pod-to-Service communication, and Ingress, applicable to all CNI implementations. Walk away with a dependable, holistic understanding of the entire network stack, fill in the blanks and connect the dots between Kubernetes Networking, Kubernetes Services, and Kubernetes Ingress."
