description: "Open source isn’t winning; it’s won. In the last decade, we’ve seen an incredible explosion in open source software. Massive projects have been developed in the open, on open operating systems, using open languages and compilers. But, Christopher Aedo asks, was all the infrastructure open as well?\n\nSource code management, CI pipelines, chat services, and IaaS all have open alternatives, but the majority of projects are developed on closed and proprietary infrastructure. Christopher explains how to make open choices with greater community impact.\n\nThis keynote is sponsored by IBM.\n\nSubscribe to O'Reilly on YouTube: http://goo.gl/n3QSYi\n\nFollow O'Reilly on \nTwitter: http://twitter.com/oreillymedia\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/OReilly\nGoogle: http://plus.google.com/+oreillymedia"
