language: English
recordingDate: 1542224927
description: "Learn from the work on the standardization of software frameworks in the R&D department of a large Japanese company. NTT has over a hundred projects using a Spring-based framework. Security requirements from typical Japanese companies are exceedingly high.\nSo they have been doing various activities to meet them: providing a guideline to implement security functions, keep watch on which OSS they select, and delivering reports of vulnerabilities. But security is not a bottleneck of development. They are discussing automated verification that will take full advantage of a standardized framework with their security team.\n\nSpeaker: Takuya Iwatsuka, NTT\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
