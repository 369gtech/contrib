description: "Stefan Neidig, Software engineer, appcom interactive GmbH\n\nBEST PRACTISES FOR ANDROID DEVELOPMENT AS A DAILY BUSINESS\nIntermediate / Best Practices / Code Quality / Talk\n\nAppcom interactive is a digital partner for enterprise companies. Among other things we build rich android applications for our clients. Over the years we developed techniques and found patterns, which helps us to meet the requirements of our clients. The quality of an application does not only depend on a cool user interface or a clever UX concept. More important are things which are not visible to the user. Most android apps have little to no architectural concept and are developed as you go. This results in code, which is unreadbale and not maintainable over time. This makes the application error prone and inflexibale against changes. Applying a sophisticated architecture and specialised patterns help maintaining a healthy code base, which is robust and yet flexible. State of the art technoligies and libraries increase your development speed and ensure that you meet deadlines and minimize the time to market. Over the years we developed techniques and found patterns, which help us to meet the requirements of our clients. Unique about them is, that they were crafted naturally by our android development team at appcom. This includes concurrent projects with tight deadlines implemented by a small team. So our findings not only cover how to structure your code and apply an architecture. But we also examine why codestyle and conventions matter and how the affect working in many projects concurrently. Furthermore we go about live templates and everything else that saves time and trouble."
