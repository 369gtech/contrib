title: '"Ray: A distributed system for emerging AI applications" by Stephanie Wang and Robert Nishihara'
language: English
recordingDate: 1539526578
description: "Over the past decade, the bulk synchronous processing (BSP) model has proven highly effective for processing large amounts of data. However, today we are witnessing the emergence of a new class of applications, i.e., AI workloads. These applications exhibit new requirements, such as nested parallelism and highly heterogeneous computations. To support such workloads, we have developed Ray, a distributed system which provides both task-parallel and actor abstractions. Ray is highly scalable employing an in-memory storage system and a distributed scheduler. In this talk, I will discuss some of our design decisions and our early experience with using Ray to implement a variety of applications.\n\nSpeakers: Stephanie Wang, Robert Nishihara"
