description: "As playhouses in America remain shuttered, actor and scrappy storyteller, Brendan Bradley has spent the quarantine using open source tools to break out of the box and share the stage with live performers around the world.\n\nAfter founding The Integrative Technology Lab at New York University, Brendan has worked in practically every medium and mode of narrative storytelling including releasing free tutorials and case-studies for live performance artists to stream their work from home using a customizable virtual theater that allows anyone in the world to perform for their own live, virtual audience for free."
