description: "From #Vilnius to #Mallorca! BUILD STUFF is going to celebrate summer! An amazing weekend on APRIL 29-30, 2017 â€“ MALLORCA, SPAIN will take you out of the office into a seaside event full of professional lectures, technical sessions, beach games, umbrella drinks, and wonderful sunset. #buildstuffes #beachconference #sun #code www.buildstuff.es\n\nI enjoy spending time making teams ship faster, better, more productively. Whether that's automating build, deployment, infrastructure or data, I like the engines to hum. Software plumbing - removing the gunk from the pipelines in a multitude of ways. Caring for and feeding the developer experience, which makes for unfrustrated engineers. Most recently, I'm doing this full-time at Improbable, where we're creating worlds.\nBefore that I have worked in developer teams, an operations, a platform engineering team, and been a generalist shipping software for JUST EAT since 2010 (with a few years doing that elsewhere first). I've lived through cultural and technological change and played a role in effecting it. I had a pivotal role in migrating our platform from a data centre to the AWS cloud - consequently, they now do tens of deployments a week compared to a tens a year. I've automated systems, tests, servers, and in some cases myself, in the time between actually shipping product improvements. I touched many parts of their platform and delude myself that I did an OK job at that."
