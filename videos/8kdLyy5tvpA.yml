While Europe is slowly awakening from an artificial deep sleep, it is certainly well equipped to find viable solutions for the future -  even during these uncertain times.\n\nIn this session, Dr.-Ing. Isabell Franck (Founder of franck.AI, member of Women in AI and Ms. AI) and Nancy Nemes (Ms. AI & #humanAIze) will present real-life examples of applied AI.
