description: "Recent progress in generating natural language text catches media attention. Are we about to get flooded by autogenerated fake news? Let's learn about approaches to machine-generated text. Get a high level idea of how can you apply basic approaches like N-grams, HMMs as well as advanced ones such as RNNs and VAEs. We'll apply those methods to real-world datasets of Polish articles from Wikipedia.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
