But how can the multi-layered challenges of search be overcome and the associated opportunities exploited?\n\nThe Exploded View model from foryouandyourcustomers provides answers to these questions. It has been continuously refined and has been proven in practice. The many possible uses of the Exploded View have shown that it can present and explain decisive interrelations for the development of an organisation and that the people involved – from managers to employees with little involvement – receive an overall picture that supports them in digital and analog change."
