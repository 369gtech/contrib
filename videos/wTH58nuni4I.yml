description: "Lydia Peabody\n\nhttps://2020.pycon.org.au/program/BAAES3\n\nAn example-focused discussion of the pitfalls and strengths of interactive Python notebooks. Topics up for discussion:\r\nNamespace pollution - what is it and why do I care?\r\nSpeed - when might my notebook be holding me back?\r\nPretty pictures - are there times when even for visuals I might skip the notebook?\r\nTransitions - Iâ€™m so comfortable using my notebook. How do I change in useful ways without grinding to a halt?\r\nFunctional combinations - can there be a happy middle ground between notebooks and scripts?\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, PyConline\n\nFri Sep  4 11:00:00 2020 at Obvious"
