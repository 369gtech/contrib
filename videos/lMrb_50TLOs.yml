description: "Algorithms on big data are driving big value in companies and organizations in every aspect. Marketing, Customer Success, Product Management, Operations, you name it; there are new ways to use data to create opportunity. The only problem is that there are only a handful of people who can build, customize, and apply these algorithms to the business. Fortunately, Havas Media found a novel approach to support over 1200 data practitioners to enable all aspects of their world wide marketing agency producing $2 Billion in revenue last year.\n\nPlease join Steven Hillion, Alpine Chief Product Officer, and Joel Horwitz, Alpine Head of Product Marketing, as they share the story of how to take advanced analytics out of the \"black box\" and into the hands of every decision maker in your organization.\n\nAttend this webcast and learn:\n\nHow to create a collaborative analytics environment at scale and accessible anywhere.\nWhat are the key areas to focus on and what are the common mistakes to avoid.\nHow to take the \"guessing\" out of building repeatable predictive analytics models.\n\nProduced by: Yasmina Greco\n\n - Don't miss an upload!
