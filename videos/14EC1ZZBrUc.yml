description: "Imagination Technologies’ MIPS processor architecture plays a big role in the Internet of Things, connecting devices (as routers) and controlling devices (as gateways/concentrators). The processors can even act as smart devices themselves. In this session, Imagination Technologies discusses its recent MIPS-related developments, including a new low-cost, easy-to-hack development board for the MIPS architecture with Raspberry Pi–peripheral support. The presentation covers developing Java SE Embedded 8 applications on a range of devices, including home routers running OpenWrt. It walks through the source code of Internet of Things examples and demos the code on the new MIPS-based development board.\n\n\nAuthors:\nDerek White\nDerek White is an engineer in the Java SE Embedded group at Oracle in Burlington, Massachusetts.\n\nPreviously I worked in Oracle/Sun Labs on the Squawk JVM - an open source virtual machine written almost entirely in Java. Squawk was a Java ME system designed for small embedded devices. Squawk was used in the SunSPOT project, a (shipping) Container Monitoring Device, as well as in the FIRST Robotics Competition.\nView more trainings by Derek White at https://www.parleys.com/author/derek-white-3\n\n Majid Bemanian\nNo bio available\nView more trainings by  Majid Bemanian at https://www.parleys.com/author/majid-bemanian\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
