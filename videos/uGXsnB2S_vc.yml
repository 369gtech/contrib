language: English
recordingDate: 1433261965
description: "The Servlet Async IO API was released into the wild more than a year ago and is a significantly different animal than the JVMâ€™s async NIO. Most developers are as familiar with scaling web applications with async techniques as they are with scaling the Himalayas with an ice axe. The implementers of Jetty are your experienced guides for this session, which examines the beast in the real world. You will discover if developers will encounter a marmot or a yeti as they attempt to scale web applications with async techniques.\n\n\nAuthor:\nGreg Wilkins\nGreg is the lead developer of the Jetty HTTP server and servlet container, as well as a key contributor to the cometd server push framework and serveral other open source projects. Greg is an active participant in the standards processes at the Java Community Process and the IETF HTTP2 working group. Greg was a founder of Mort Bay Consulting and Webtide.com. He is now a senior architect at Intalio|Webtide.\nView more trainings by Greg Wilkins at https://www.parleys.com/author/greg-wilkins-1\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
