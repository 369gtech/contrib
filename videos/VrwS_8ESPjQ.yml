In theory it allows concurrent programs to achieve good scalability as the number of cores increases. OK, but what happens in practice?\n\nSince November 2011, we have embarked on a project that aims to improve the scalability of Erlang programs on machines with hundreds, thousands, and possibly even hundreds of thousands of cores. As a first step, we have created a benchmark suite, consisting of both synthetic benchmarks and actual Erlang applications with needs for massive concurrency, in order to measure the scalability of existing Erlang/OTP versions, identify possible bottlenecks in the language and the VM, and get inspiration for language extensions and VM improvements for future versions of Erlang/OTP. The talk will present the results of our investigation so far and offer some advice on dos and don'ts for achieving good scalability on the existing VM.\n\nNOTE: If you are curious to find out how your application performs in terms of scalability, feel free to send it to the speaker by mid-March and he may include the results in his talk. The only prerequisite is that your application should be highly concurrent and more or less self-contained.\"\n\nFollow us on Twitter @Erlangfactory \_https://twitter.com/#!/erlangfactory\_\nJoin our group on Linkedin Erlang Factory \_http://www.linkedin.com/groups/Erlang-Factory-2003110?trk=myg_ugrp_ovr"
