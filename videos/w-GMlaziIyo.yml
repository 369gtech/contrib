description: "Recording brought to you by American Express https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs\nThe Kotlin compiler plugin API gives us powerful features like Parcelize and the synthetic view accessor methods in kotlinx.android. These features could not be built using similar, but more limited, mechanisms, such as annotation processing.\n\nThe Kotlin compiler plugin API is not currently well-documented, but that doesn't mean that it can't be explored! In this talk, we start from scratch and show how we can build a compiler plugin and deploy an artifact to a public location, so that we can build plugins that can be applied as easily as the official compiler plugins.\n\nAbout the Presenter:\nKevin Most is a New York City-based software engineer who is passionate about Android, and excited about Kotlin. Kevin currently works at Google on the Mobile Vision team, exploring the various applications of the image recognition libraries that power Lens and other Google vision products."
