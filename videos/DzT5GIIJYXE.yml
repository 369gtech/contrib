description: "Pivotal and Techweek LA hosted a special screening of, CODE: Debugging the Gender Gap (http://www.codedocumentary.com/) . CODE documentary takes a closer look at tech hubs around the world and why the total number of female and minority software engineers have dropped. The documentary poses the questions: why is there a dearth of female and minority software engineers, what would society gain from having more women and people of color coding, and how do we get there? CODE goes beyond laying bare the tech world’s dirty secrets – an exercise of razor-like precision – to offer solutions, highlighting an array of breakthrough efforts that are producing a more diverse set of computer programmers.\n\nThe screening was followed by a panel discussion featuring Katy Lynch, CEO of Techweek, Abby Kearns of Pivotal, Jane Margolis of UCLA, and Colleen Lewis of Harvey Mudd College. The panel explored both the challenges that companies face today with diversity, and how they can solve them.\n\nPanelists: Katy Lynch, CEO of Techweek, Abby Kearns of Pivotal, Jane Margolis of UCLA, and Colleen Lewis of Harvey Mudd College"
