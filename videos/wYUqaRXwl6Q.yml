Learn more about Code & Supply at https://www.codeandsupply.co.\n\n------\n\nTechnology has a deep impact on society. When you work in tech, you can see things about society that people without your background can’t see. I’d like to tell a story about my experiences teaching women in prison. I’ll illustrate the difference in my experience before and after working with a public dataset that proves people are kept in prison unjustly. This talk is about how you need to be careful about the things you build, and ask the difficult questions about what it will be used for. But this talk is also about the fact that when building new technology, you MUST make decisions based on research and data. This talk is about my experience playing with data and how that translated to deeper understanding and greater compassion for people."
