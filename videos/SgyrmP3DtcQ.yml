description: "Stories are stories but storytelling has changed. New technologies have always fundamentally changed how we see and process the world but now we are in a period of exponential change. We can connect story, technology and design together to tell different kinds of stories and reach audiences in new ways. And through social media, these audiences now have their own audiences.\n\nThis new storytelling paradigm has been described as participatory, cross-platform, immersive, transmedia and interactive. But these projects require a great deal of collaboration across industries and skill sets. What kinds of stories are possible now? And how do we collaborate across disciplines to tell them? Ingrid Kopp explores. \n\nIngrid Kopp\nDirector of Digital Initiatives, Tribeca Film Institute\nhttps://twitter.com/fromthehip\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
