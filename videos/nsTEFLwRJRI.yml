description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nFrom Alert Notification to Comparison of Good and Bad Requests in One Click - Shreyas Srivatsan, Chronosphere \n\nMetrics are a great tool for notifying when something goes wrong. Distributed tracing provides the ability to drill down deeper into an issue when triaging an alert with a non-obvious root cause. It’s already difficult to jump from metrics raising an alert to a representative problematic trace, but even once there, users often want to compare a problematic trace with a non-problematic one to help root cause the issue. This talk demonstrates how to jump straight from an alert notification to displaying a problematic trace along with a comparison to a non-problematic trace.  This is accomplished with a combination of open source tools such as Prometheus, Jaeger, Grafana and M3. The audience will learn how recent advances in the community can enable them to reduce their time-to-mitigation by providing the relevant context of a bad request vs a good request directly from a graph.\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zeoq"
