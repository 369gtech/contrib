title: 'YOW! Lambda Jam 2018 - George Wilson - Lessons From the Design and Implementation of a CSV Library'
language: English
recordingDate: 1532998802
description: "From CSV, to JSON, to YAML, DER, and the dreaded XML, many programmers are dealing with data formats all day. In statically-typed languages like Haskell, we can get a great benefit by imposing a rigid structure of types on the data we consume from these formats. We call this process of imposing structure on data \"decoding\".\n\nDecoding libraries are available in many languages and for many formats. This talk explores the design decisions behind a new Haskell library, sv, which decodes CSV and similar formats such as PSV. sv addresses what we perceived as problems with other libraries. We will discuss the benefits and drawbacks of the interesting or noteworthy choices made in sv's philosophy and design, and make recommendations as to how these lessons could be applied to other formats.\n\nGeorge is an enthusiastic programmer working at the Queensland Functional Programming Lab within Data61/CSIRO. George loves working with and speaking about Functional Programming, usually in Haskell. George is also a co-organiser of the Brisbane Functional Programming Group, and a member of the Haskell.org committee.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
