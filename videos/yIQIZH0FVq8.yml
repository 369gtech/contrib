The rapidly-evolving specs surrounding networking, browsers, HTML, CSS, and Javascript are bringing many performance improvements, and this session will cover big things to look out for in 2017.\n\nThe session will mostly cover general front-end performance concerns, but no worries, I will showcase Drupal 8 projects and techniques for each particular topic area with a few turnkey options ready to go.\n\nAudience\n\nAttendees should be passionate about web performance and comfortable with web development technology and tooling. If you use browser dev tools, web performance testing systems like Google PageSpeed Insights or WebPageTest, and plan to make performance-related improvements to your web site(s) in 2017, this session is for you.\n\nOutcome\n\nFaster websites :)\n\nMy goal is to help attendees leave excited and informed about tackling web performance.
