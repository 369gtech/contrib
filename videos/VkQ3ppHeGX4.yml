title: 'Developing with Java and Couchbase Server'
recordingDate: 1334111837
description: "NoSQL has garnered tremendous attention in recent years as the basis of architectures for building large linearly scalable systems. As a document oriented database, Couchbase Server presents the user with a simple approach to storing and retrieving data across a cluster.\n\nCouchbase Server 2.0 has rich querying capabilities of the distributed database through views built atop an always updating incremental map-reduce. Accessing Couchbase Server is also very easy, as there are client SDKs for Java, .NET, PHP, Ruby and many other common languages. Currently in developer preview, Couchbase Server builds upon Apache CouchDB and Memcached.\n\nAttend this session for a very quick overview of Couchbase NoSQL, the ecosystem and what it means to Java developers and implementers. We will demonstrate with examples of how to use the Java APIs on Couchbase to drive home some of these concepts.\n\n\nAbout Raghavan Srinivas:\n\nRaghavan \"Rags\" Srinivas is a Developer Advocate at Couchbase getting his hands dirty with emerging technology directions and trends. His general focus area is in distributed systems, with a specialization in cloud computing. He worked on Hadoop and HBase during its early stages. He has spoken on a variety of technical topics at conferences around the world, conducted and organized Hands-on Labs and taught graduate classes in the evening.\n\nRags brings with him about 20 years of hands-on software development and about 10 years of architecture and technology evangelism/advocacy experience. He worked for Digital Equipment Corporation, Sun Microsystems, Intuit and Accenture. He has worked on several technology areas, including internals of VMS, Unix and NT to Hadoop and HBase. He has evangelized and influenced the architecture of a number of technology areas including the early releases of JavaFX, Java, Java EE, Java and XML, Java ME, AJAX and Web 2.0, Java Security and so on.\n\nRags holds a Masters degree in Computer Science from the Center of Advanced Computer Studies at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. He loves running and eating spicy food."
