description: "Speaker: Meng Weng Wong (Legalese.io)\n\nTalk of 20 minutes\n\nLegalese helps entrepreneurs take the law into their own hands, by turning contracts into templates, configuration, and code – all on Github. Instead of paying lawyers for access to their proprietary precedents, founders and freelancers can use opensource tools to draft their own NDAs, ESOPs, and angel/seed investment agreements. After a short demo of the system we escalate quickly into a review of the 30-year history of legal informatics, deontic calculi, and programming language theory which Legalese is now productizing with its own DSL.\n\nAbout Meng Weng Wong:\n\nMeng started and exited two startups in the US. Returning to Singapore, he perpetuated the cycle of abuse as an angel investor and mentor at JFDI.Asia. At JFDI, in the course of developing a portfolio of 60+ startups, Meng had to help draft and execute dozens of legal agreements for each startup. To his horror he discovered startup financing is currently a manual process involving corporate secretaries and expensive lawyers, hence a ripe opportunity for software innovation and the basis for an opensource startup serving a global market. Meng programs in Perl and Javascript, and is now learning Prolog, Clojure, and Haskell.\n\nEvent Page: http://2016.fossasia.org/schedule/#OT-57\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/WCcQ/"
