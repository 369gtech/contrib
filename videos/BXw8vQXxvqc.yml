title: 'How to Build a  Cybersecurity Startup'
language: English
recordingDate: 1567008727
description: "I've built a demo app called DharmaSecurity, a fraud detection tool for businesses. The way it works is that once signed up, a business will paste a code snippet into their website, and then they'll get access to a dashboard that tells them how many fraudulent accounts they have. Our app will use machine learning to automatically remove suspected fraud accounts, and flag likely ones for review. To build this, I use a suite of AWS tools, python, javascript, a logistic regression model, a credit card fraud dataset, and a library called openmined to enable federated learning and secure multiparty computation. I've packed a lot into this video, animations, code, music, screencasts, skits, etc. Enjoy! \n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/Build-a-Cybersecurity-Startup\n\nIt would mean so much to me if you subscribe to my Youtube channel! https://bit.ly/2SvhG7v\n\nINSTAGRAM: https://bit.ly/312pLUb\nFACEBOOK: https://bit.ly/2OqOhx1\nTWITTER: https://bit.ly/2OHYLbB\nWEBSITE: https://bit.ly/2OoVPQF\n\nOmar's Winning Code:\nhttps://github.com/Omega97/Ramanujan_Machine\n\nBuild a Startup Playlist:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeraUtRgsbI&list=PL2-dafEMk2A4n3aP_rzgqA8lVGknkSN2p\n\nBinary Logistic Regression:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6ii7NFdDeg&t=1s\n\nDetailed Logistic Regression Video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8alok2P468\n\nAWS Training Video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkzED9HvMG0\n\nGenerating Celebrity Voices:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_sjvAHLpA\n\nJoin us in the Wizards Slack channel:\nhttp://wizards.herokuapp.com/\n\nHit the Join button above to sign up to become a member of my channel for access to exclusive live streams!\n\nJoin us at the School of AI:\nhttps://theschool.ai/\n\nSignup for my newsletter for exciting updates in the field of AI:\nhttps://goo.gl/FZzJ5w\n\nAnd please support me on Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/user?u=3191693"
