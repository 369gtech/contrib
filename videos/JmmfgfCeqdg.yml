title: 'Theo Schlossnagle - Add Simplicity to Complex Systems'
recordingDate: 1558058651
description: "The systems we build today are fundamentally complex.  As a software engineering discipline, we've bought into building complex distributed systems (applications) on top of complex distributed systems (microservices) on top of complex distributed systems (modern virtual infrastructure) on top of complex distributed systems (cloud services).  In the immortal words of Socrates: \"I drank what?\"\r\n\r\nThe only way to reason about these systems is to provide relatively simplistic abstractions at the right boundaries.  In this talk, we'll talk about the ins and outs of the boundary selections for both developers and operators in a high-scale, high-performance, geo-distributed database.  The audience will walk away with a line of questioning to help inform both boundary selection and problem selection in their own software engineering adventures. - Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/craft"
