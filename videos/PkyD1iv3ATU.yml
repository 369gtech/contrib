description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2018\n—\nWe hear a lot about value semantics whenever there's discussion of C++, and value semantics are often credited as one of the \"Big Ideas\" of C++; but what does this phrase mean? And how can you use the principles of value semantics and regularity to make your code faster and more correct? \n\nWe'll touch on using the existing value semantic standard library types, as well as creating your own types that follow these principles. You will learn useful optimization habits which create faster code without giving up the benefits of value semantics. I'll show you how to think in a value semantic way, so that your code is simple, fast, and correct!\n— \nNicole Mazzuca\nSoftware Engineering Intern, Microsoft\nNicole Mazzuca is a C++ and Rust programmer who is very interested in object models - she is helping to write the Rust object model, and as such has studied other object models heavily, especially C++'s.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
