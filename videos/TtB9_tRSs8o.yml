Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe in Barcelona, May 20–23 (https://bit.ly/2B2vhMl), in Shanghai, June 24–26 (https://bit.ly/2JZcBjs), or in San Diego November 18–21 (https://bit.ly/2K031wW) in 2019. \n\nEvolving Sigma: Adapting Kubernetes at Alibaba - Xiang Li, Alibaba\n\nEvolving Sigma: Adapting Kubernetes at Alibaba - Xiang Li, Alibaba Sigma is a cluster management system we use at Alibaba for running online services. The typical container cluster It manages has tens of thousands of servers which is beyond the capability of current Kubernetes. It also manages legacy workloads which are not container based. With the increasing popularity of Kuberenetes, we tried to integrate Kubernetes into our Sigma system. However, there are significant challenges in doing so. How do we extend Kubernetes to support different types of workloads? How do we scale Kubernetes to manage thousands of nodes? How do we keep Kubernetes API while integrating Kubernetes with our infrastructure layer?  This talk we will first provide an overview of Sigma. Then we will cover the solutions on how we extend, scale and integrate Kubernetes into Sigma at Alibaba. We will also share the lessons learned in the process. \n\nTo learn more click here:\_ https://sched.co/FuJe"
