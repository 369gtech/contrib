description: "The Azure platform is one that demonstrates what customers can do at hyperscale. We will discuss and demonstrate the Openness of the Azure platform to provision and iterate your way to Production in ways that you may not have associated as being the Microsoft way.\n\nWith Microsoft Partners, we will follow a journey from development into production and how you can utilise the fast rate of change of data (IoT, Retail, Finance etc.), and match this with the automation, compliance and development to match your development with the innovation needed to keep up.\n\nJustin Davies is the Technical Lead for Open Source at Microsoft in the UK. Heâ€™s been working with Open Source for 18 years, working with companies from Startups, Media and Financial Services to Public Sector to implement OSS and championing its adoption to drive innovation and agility"
