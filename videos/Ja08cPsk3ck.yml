description: 'In just 60 minutes, this session will demonstrate an end to end data pipeline supplemented by AI to achieve insights real-time. Using components like Azure Functions, Event Hubs, Databricks, Cognitive Services, and Power BI I''ll be putting together a pipeline that takes our #msBuild social stream and analyses it realtime. Join me as I show how quickly these sorts of systems can be put together for awesome insight.'
