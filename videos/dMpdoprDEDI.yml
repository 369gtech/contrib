description: "( Data Science Training - https://www.edureka.co/data-science )\nData Science Blog Series: https://goo.gl/1CKTyN\nhttp://www.edureka.co/data-science\nPlease write back to us at sales@edureka.co or call us at +91-8880862004 for more information. \n\nData Science is all about extracting knowledge from data. Data Science is the integration of methods from mathematics, probability models, machine learning, computer programming, statistics, data engineering, pattern recognition and learning, visualization, uncertainty modelling, data warehousing, and high performance computing with the goal of extracting meaning from data and creating data products. This interdisciplinary and cross-functional field leads to decisions that move an organization forward in terms of proposed investment, decisions regarding a product or business strategy. \n\nData Science is a buzzword, often used interchangeably with analytics or big data. At times, Analytics is synonymous with Data Science, but at times it represents something else. A Data Scientist using raw data to build a predictive behaviour model, falls in to the category of analytics.\n\nData science is a steadily growing discipline that is driving significant changes across industries and in companies of every size. It is emerging as a critical source for insights for enterprises dealing with massive amounts of data. \n\n\n\nAbout the Data Science Course at edureka! - \n\nThis Data Science course is designed to provide knowledge and skills to become a successful Data Scientist. The course covers a range of Hadoop, R and Machine Learning Techniques encompassing the complete Data Science study.\nCourse Objectives\n\nAfter the completion of the Data science Course at Edureka, you should be able to:\n\nGain an insight into the 'Roles' played by a Data Scientist.\nAnalyse Big Data using Hadoop and R.\nUnderstand the Data Analysis Life Cycle.\nUse tools such as 'Sqoop' and 'Flume' for acquiring data in Hadoop Cluster.\nAcquire data with different file formats like JSON, XML, CSV and Binary.\nLearn tools and techniques for sampling and filtering data, and data transformation.\nUnderstand techniques of Natural Language Processing and Text Analysis.\nStatistically analyse and explore data using R.\nCreate predictive using Hadoop Mappers and Reducers.\nUnderstand various Machine Learning Techniques and their implementation these using Apache Mahout.\nGain insight into the visualisation and optimisation of data.\n\nWho should go for this course?\n\nThis course is designed for all those who want to learn machine learning techniques and wish to apply these techniques on Big Data. The course is amalgamation of two powerful open source tools: 'R' language and Hadoop software framework.\n\nYou will learn how to explore data quantitatively using tools like Sqoop and Flume, write Hadoop MapReduce Jobs, perform Text Analysis and implement Language Processing, learn Machine Learning techniques using Mahout, and optimize and visualise the results using programming language 'R' and Apache Mahout.\n\nThis course is for you if you are:\n\nA SAS, SPSS Analytics Professional.\nA Hadoop Professional working on Database management and streaming of Big Data.\nAn 'R' professional who wants to apply Statistical techniques on Big Data.\nA Statistician who wants to understand Data Science methodologies to implement the statistics methods and techniques on Big data.\nAny Business Analyst who is working on creating reports and dashboards.\n\nPre-requisites\n\nSome of the prerequisites for learning Data Science are familiarity with Hadoop, Machine Learning and knowledge of R (recommended not mandatory as these concepts will also be covered during the course). Also, having a statistical background will be an added advantage.\n  Why Learn Data Science?\n'Data Science' is a term which came into popularity in past decade. Data Science is the process of extracting valuable insights from \"data\". It is the right time to learn Data science because:\n\nWe are living in the Big Data Era, Data Science is becoming a very promising field to harness and process huge volumes of data generated from various sources.\n\nA data scientist has a dual role -- that of an \"Analyst\" as well as that of an \"Artist\"! Data scientists are very curious, who love large amount of data, and more than that, they love to play with such huge data to reach important inferences and spot trends. You could be one of them!\n\nAs 'Data Science' is an emerging field, there is a plethora of opportunities available world across. Just browse through any of the job portals; you will be taken aback by the number of job openings available for Data scientists in different industries, whether it is IT or healthcare, Retail or Government offices or Academics, Life Sciences, Oceanography, etc.\n\nRead this blog post on Data Science to know more.\nhttp://www.edureka.co/blog/who-is-a-data-scientist/"
