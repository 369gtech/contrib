description: "JavaScript frameworks are on the rise. More and more companies employ specialized frontend teams which are building client side web applications. As projects grow, things start to get more complicated. Building a feature requires coordination between frontend and backend teams. In my talk I present an alternative organizational model where teams have end-to-end ownership. Each team focusses on one specific use-case and not a technology. Building a site with independent cross-functional teams has major advantages. It reduces communication and make shipping features fun again.\n\nBut maintaining a consistent and performant user interface comes with a few technical challenges."
