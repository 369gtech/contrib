BOSH releases require frequent dependency updates and must be tested with the latest stemcell versions. The same applies to Kubernetes with Docker images, container registries and a bunch of configuration files.  In this talk, Michael & Cedric explain how developers can free themselves from this burden and automate daunting tasks with Concourse. They show a simple yet powerful way that can be used to automate BOSH and Kubernetes Software releases and which also covers dependency and test automation for both BOSH and Kubernetes.  With these guidelines in hand, participants will know how to spend less time on code maintenance and more on software development. \n\nFor more info: https://www.cloudfoundry.org/"
