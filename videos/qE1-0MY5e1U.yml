description: "In 1978, Tony Hoare presented communicating sequential processes (CSP) to the world. Systems envisioned by CSP are composed of sequential processes that communicate via message passing. In 1973, Hewitt, Bishop, and Steiger introduced the actor model to the world. Actors, like processes in CSP, are isolated entities that communicate via message passing. In recent years, weâ€™ve seen the actor model gain widespread adoption through technologies like Erlang and Akka.\n\nThe reactive model is an evolution of the CSP and actor models that switches the focus to data flows and transformations on those data flows. Like the CSP and actor models, the reactive model exhibits self-similarity at all levels of system architecture; in essence, reactive architectures are fractal. Rob Harrop explores how to exploit this architectural similarity and how to use the concepts of CSP, actors, and reactive as powerful tools for reasoning about your system."
