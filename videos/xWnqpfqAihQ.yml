description: "This video was recorded at Lambda Days Virtual 2021 - https://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2021\n\n Fast XML HTML for Haskell  XML TypeLift | Michał J. Gajda, Science-based solutions \n\nABSTRACT\nWe presents and compares a range of parsers with and without data mapping for conversion between XML and Haskell. The best performing parser competes favorably with the fastest tools available in other languages and is, thus, suitable for use in large-scale data analysis. The best performing parser also allows software developers of intermediate-level Haskell programming skills to start processing large numbers of XML documents soon after finding the relevant XML Schema from a simple internet search, without the need for specialist prior knowledge or skills. We hope that this unique combination of parser performance and usability will provide a new standard for XML mapping to high-level languages.  \n\n\n• Follow us on social: \n  Twitter: https://twitter.com/LambdaDays\n\n  LinkedIn: ttps://www.linkedin.com/company/lambda-days\n\n• Looking for a unique learning experience?\n  Attend the next Lambda Days conference!\n  See what's coming up at: https://www.lambdadays.org\n\n• SUBSCRIBE TO OUR CHANNEL\n  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC47eUBNO8KBH_V8AfowOWOw"
