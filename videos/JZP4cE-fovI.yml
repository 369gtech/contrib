description: "Do you avoid small talk by the coffee machine?\nDo you prefer one-on-one conversations instead of speaking on public?\nDo you prefer listening before talking?\nAre you thinking things through before speaking?\nIs your social network narrowed to only a few close friends?\nAre you described as quiet, shy, reserved? and get recommendations to talk more or take initiatives?\nHave you ever felt like you don't fit in and need to adapt to get accepted?\nHave you heard about the concepts of intro-extraversion and ambivalence?\n... and do you, at the same time, consider yourself as a leader?\nHow could a person that is feeling introvert be a good leader;\n- when social interactions are draining energy?\n- when you are supposed to be confident to talk to other people, and maybe in larger groups as well\n\nSpeaker Daniel Berntsson says:\nSince I was 14-15 years old I've known that I'm not like the society expects me to be - when it comes to school, friends, hobbies, work... I was supposed to have many friends and being social and if I didn't meet up to those expectations, I got questions if I was tired or if something was wrong. Of course, nothing was wrong, I was myself. I was introvert.\n\nToday I'm sharing my inside story about 15 years of social adjustment experience; the skills I’ve\n\ndeveloped and the tools I've used to handle situations that are complex to deal with, being an introvert.\n___________________________\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry.
