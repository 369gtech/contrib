language: English
recordingDate: 1636108518
description: "This talk was presented during the React Native EU 2021 - the largest community conference in the world focused exclusively on React Native.\n\nAbstract:You've got an idea for an app and you've thought through how you'll build it. Now it's time to make your idea a reality. Along your development journey, you'll almost certainly run into complexities when configuring your project, sharing it with your team, submitting it to the app stores, and keeping it updated over time. In this talk, you'll learn how to take your idea from back-of-the-napkin notes to a full-fledged app store app using open source tools and services from Expo. \nBio:\nJon Samp is a software developer and designer at Expo. In 2019, Jon built a React Native app named Codecademy Go, which was featured as Apple's App Store App of the Day. Jon enjoys making pour-over coffee, distance running, and hanging out with his partner and their two pets.\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jonsamp\nGithub: https://github.com/jonsamp"
