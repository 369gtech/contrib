description: "Each time you publish an API, you punch a hole in your enterprise perimeter. Through APIs, a lot of critical data which used to be well-protected in enterprises data centers is now exposed directly to the Internet. Whenever you create APIs, you have to make sure that you have done everything you could to validate data flows, properly authenticate users, authorize access to the data, keep an audit trail among other security tasks. In this talk, Isabelle explains the roots of current API security issues, and how you can address them at development time. \n \nAbout:\n\nIsabelle Mauny.
