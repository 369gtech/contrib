Service Catalog lets you provision cloud services directly from the comfort of native Kubernetes tooling, regardless of where the service is actually hosted. Service Catalog is a Kubernetes implementation of the Open Service Broker API, an open standard to provision and manage cloud services. Come learn how you can use Service Catalog to access third-party services from your Kubernetes applications or to offer your service to Kubernetes users. We will walk through provisioning a relational database through Service Catalog and and then connect to it from an application running on Kubernetes. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UaiQ"
