Starting with a quick overview of Service Catalog and some of the challenges we faced while bridging the different processing models between Kubernetes and the Open Service Broker API, we will then look at more advanced scenarios and new features from the perspective of cluster operators, application developers and helm chart authors. Youâ€™ll come away with a solid understanding of how Service Catalog works and recommended workflows and practices for using it. Finally we would love for anyone considering contributing to stop by and get an introduction to all the parts of Service Catalog, meet the maintainers and learn how to become a contributor! \n\nTo learn more click here:  https://sched.co/FuLk"
