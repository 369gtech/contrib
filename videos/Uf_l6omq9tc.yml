recordingDate: 1513008291
description: "In this talk meet-up group Critical Tech approach cybercrime from a personal and harmful perspective. As covered in previous talks, cyber security regarding technologies that we are using on a daily basis are still lacking fundamental security standards. IoTs for example become more and more part of our homes - is our physical safety ensured?\n\nCybercrime is often considered in context of monetary loss or data loss but victimisation through means of computer and technologies can affect us also personally, it can intrude our privacy, trick us into taken certain actions, digital data can be used to harm us. In this talk, we want to step away from security in the sense of making sure systems are patched, default passwords are changed etc. and talk more about cyber occurrences that use images and videos to extort, shame, blackmail and harm us by uploading images to the Internet without our consent.\n\nIts a socio-legal approach to phenomena such as sextortion, webcam blackmail, cyber revenge / revenge porn and image-based abuse. Terminology is often blurry when researching these phenomena, we will walk through different forms of cybercrime / cyberaggressions and talk about methodology of cybercriminals. Do victims know the offender and thus is the crime personally intended? Is it random by baiting victims into sending pictures? How much identifiable information is uploaded to the Internet?\n\nAnd most importantly, how can this be approached legally?\n\nDiana is a criminologist and researched this topic during her master thesis. She will make an introduction to the different phenomena of interpersonal cybercrime based on her qualitative research and current literature review.\n\nS is a lawyer focused on digital law, intellectual property and personal data. She will talk about some of the legal aspects applicable to handle sextortion, and describe how sextortion is captured by criminal legislation. We will also look into alternative legal possibilities for countering the problem of sextortion, in addition to public prosecution. Perhaps there are lessons learned from other legal fields, such as intellectual property law, and legislation concerning personal data… Yes, there will be mentioning of the GDPR and the Pirate Bay… Stay tuned!\n_______________________\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry.
