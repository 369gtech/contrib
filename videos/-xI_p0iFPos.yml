description: "One of the main design considerations for the Java platform is to provide a secure environment for executing code from trusted and untrusted sources in a mobile world. Java comes with its own unique set of security challenges. Although the Java security architecture can protect users and systems from hostile programs downloaded over a network, it cannot defend against implementation bugs that occur in trusted code. Such bugs can inadvertently open the very holes that the security architecture was designed to contain. This presentation aims to help the attendees avoid security bugs to keep Java safe. It provides examples of good and bad uses of security patterns and gives advice on how refactorings will lead to safer programs.\n\n\nAuthor:\nAndrew Gross\nAndrew Gross has worked in security for 25 years and currently leads the Java Vulnerability Team.\nView more trainings by Andrew Gross at https://www.parleys.com/author/andrew-gross\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
