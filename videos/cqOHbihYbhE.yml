description: "Google Tech Talks\nNovember 11, 2008\n\nABSTRACT\n\nBerners-Lee's vision of the Semantic Web is hindered by a chicken-and-egg problem, which can be best solved by a bootstrapping method: creating enough structured data to motivate the development of applications. We believe that autonomously `Semantifying Wikipedia' is the best way to bootstrap. We choose Wikipedia as an initial data source, because it is comprehensive, high-quality, modestly sized, and contains enough manually-derived structure to bootstrap an autonomous, self-supervised process. In this talk I will present our success to date in this endeavor:\n\n A novel approach for self-supervised learning of CRF information extractors\n\n Automatic construction of a comprehensive ontology via statistical-relational learning\n\n Vast improvements in extraction recall through shrinkage over this ontology and retraining\n\n The stimulation of a virtuous feedback cycle between communal content creation and information extraction\n\nWe aim to construct a knowledge base of outstanding size to support inference, automatic question answering, faceted browsing, and potentially to bootstrap the Semantic Web.\n\nSpeaker: Daniel S. Weld\nDaniel S. Weld is Thomas J. Cable / WRF Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington.
