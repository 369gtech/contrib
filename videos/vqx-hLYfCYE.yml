description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nBeyond printf and tcpdump: Debugging Kubernetes Networking with eBPF - Martynas Pumputis & Aditi Ghag, Isovalent\n\nDebugging Kubernetes networking issues can easily turn into a nightmare. Packets from one pod to another can traverse a couple of dozen Linux kernel functions. Each function execution outcome might depend on an OS state which is not exposed to a user and is not visible with traditional Linux networking tooling. And those tools can’t tell you how network packets relate to K8s pods and services. Luckily, with the help of eBPF we no longer need to treat Linux kernel networking in the context of K8s as a big blackbox. In this talk DevOps who operate K8s clusters will learn: - Packet inspection across layer 2, layer 3 and policy routing, socket, and so on, regardless of the CNI. - How eBPF can be used to efficiently troubleshoot K8s networking issues. - Real-life examples of K8s networking problems and how they were debugged with eBPF. No previous knowledge of kernel internals or deep understanding of networking is required to attend the talk."
