title: 'C++20: Reaching for the Aims of C++ - Bjarne Stroustrup - CppCon 2021'

description: "https://cppcon.org/\nhttps://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2020\n---\nOut of necessity C++ has been an evolving language. I outline some early ideals for C++, some techniques for keeping the evolution directed, and show how C++20 comes close to many of those ideals. Specific topics includes type-and-resource safe code, generic programming, modularity, and the elimination of the preprocessor. Naturally, over the years, C++ has acquired many “barnacles” that can become obstacles to developing elegant and efficient code. That has been a recognized problem since the early days of C – Dennis Ritchie and I talked about it – so we must distinguish between what can be done and what should be done. The C++ Core Guidelines is the current best effort in that direction.\n\n---\nBjarne Stroustrup\nC++: history, design, use, standardization, future; performance, reliability; software developer education; distributed systems \n\nBio: www.stroustrup.com/bio.html\n---\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com\n\nThe CppCon YouTube Channel Is Sponsored By:\nJetBrains : http://jb.gg/cpptools \nSonarSource:  https://www.sonarsource.com/"
