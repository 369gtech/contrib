description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nProxyless Service Mesh with gRPC - Menghan Li, Google \n\ngRPC is a popular choice for building microservices. A service mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer for communications between microservices, with features such as service discovery, load balancing, application security and observability.  A service mesh typically uses sidecar proxies alongside the service instances to provide these features. In this session, we will introduce the new exciting development of service mesh features in gRPC, and show how to build a proxyless gRPC service mesh without the complexity of managing sidecar proxies. This talk will cover the architecture followed by a demo on how this works in practice. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ekI8"
