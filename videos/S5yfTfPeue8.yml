description: "This session is for developers looking to go beyond the basics with Micronaut, a new microservices and serverless framework for Java, Kotlin, and Groovy. Taking an extensive look at how advanced features such as dependency injection (DI), aspect-oriented programming (AOP), and ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation work, the creator of Micronaut, Graeme Rocher, will walk attendees through Micronautâ€™s elegant programming model.\n\nAttendees will come away with a better understanding about the motivations behind Micronaut's design.\n\nGraeme Rocher is a software engineer and professional open source contributor who created several popular open source projects including Grails (http://grails.org), GORM (http://gorm.grails.org), and Micronaut (http://micronaut.io). Rocher currently leads the development of the Grails and Micronaut frameworks at OCI (http://www.ociweb.com) and is the author and/or co-author of several books including The Definitive Guide to Grails 2 (Apress). Graeme won the inaugural Oracle Groundbreaker award in 2018."
