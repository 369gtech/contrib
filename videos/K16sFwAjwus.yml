description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\n在线视频架构将服务韧性从Spring Cloud 熔断器升级到服务网格 | Online Video upgrades resilience from SC Circuit Breaker to Service Mesh - Xu Shiyu, RR Video & Zhang Chaomeng, Huawei\n\n作为中国领先的在线视频共享平台，人人视频业务的快速发展给其 IT 基础设施带来了巨大挑战。日益增长的复杂性、容量和韧性要求给当前基于 Spring Cloud 熔断器的微服务带来了新的问题。在本次演讲中，超盟和世宇将重点介绍大规模生产环境中的服务网格韧性实践，包括不健康实例的透明自动隔离、故障自动恢复和自我修复、连接池管理、重试、限流、超时和分布式跟踪等。通过分析熔断器模式和比较 Spring Cloud 熔断器和服务网格在各自生产实践中不同的实现方式，结果表明优化不只是改善了系统的可靠性和可用性，还使得开发和操作工作更简单便捷。\n\nAs one leading Online Video sharing platform in China, RR's rapid business development introduce great challenge on its IT infrastructure. The increasing complexity, capacity and resilience requirement brings new problems to current Spring Cloud circuit breaker based micro services. In this presentation, Chaomeng and Shiyu will focus on service mesh resilience practice in large scale production environment, including transparent auto-isolation of the unhealthy instance, auto-recovery and self-healing, connection pool management, retry, fine gained rate limit and distributed tracing, latency metrics. By analyzing circuit breaker pattern and comparing the different implementation of Spring Cloud circuit breaker and service mesh in their production practice, they show that the optimization not only improves system reliability and availability but also makes dev and ops works simpler and easier."
