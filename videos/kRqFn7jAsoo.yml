title: '[WiSDOM] Learning Word2Vec Embeddings for  Hexcluster Generation'
language: English
recordingDate: 1580220011
description: "On October 24, 2019, the WiSDOM (Women in Statistics, Data, Optimization, and Machine Learning) Employee Resource Group hosted the second annual Moving The World With Data meetup, welcoming hundreds of members of the Bay Area tech community to learn about some of our toughest, most interesting data science problems.\n\nDuring her presentation, data scientist Mo Zhou explains how her approach to crafting the perfect hexclusters borrowed concepts from natural language processing (NLP), leveraging Word2Vec to find embeddings that quantify the similarity between hexagons. She then clusters similar hexagons into small groups where Uber activity is dense, and larger groups where things are less busy. Ultimately, the Uber Eats customer gets a delicious burger and the delivery person and restaurant earn money, and the entire process is more efficient than it would be without Moâ€™s work.\_\n\nLearn more about this event: https://eng.uber.com/moving-the-world-with-data"
