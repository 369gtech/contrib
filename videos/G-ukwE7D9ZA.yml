recordingDate: 1514638866
description: "Remote working in our industry is becoming more prevalent everyday. Geography is no longer a constraint in setting up a work function in an organisation.In 2010 REA Group, together with ThoughtWorks China, set up an offshore delivery centre.This centre works extremely effectively using REA Agile processes.\n\nI have been building remote teams in Xi’an for the past 2 1/2 years. As a Technical Lead,I have detailed hands on experience and specifics that I will share with the audience on what has worked well for us as well as what hasn’t worked so well. This case study will provide a recipe for working with remote agile teams effectively. In particular I will cover:\n\nRemote team composition\nEssential technology\nCore practices\nAsynchronous versus Synchronous communication\nCommon Challenges\nBuilding a successful culture\nTips and tricks for remote working\n\nAdam is a technologist at heart with degrees in Mechatronic Engineering and Computer Science from Melbourne. Adam spent the early days of his career designing propeller shafts for well known Ford motor vehicles, and could be one of the reasons why taxis in Australia are so noisy.He soon realised his passion really lay in agile software development and as a result, made the transition to IT consulting.\n\nHe spent the next 7 years developing software and leading teams in industries such as healthcare, banking & finance, government and telecommunications.\n\nAdam has spent the last 3 years as a Technical lead at REA Group working with teams to improve back end systems. Most recently, based in Perth, he has been working with remote teams in Melbourne and Xi’an, China.He is an advocate for iterative development, good design and choosing the appropriate technologies to get the job done.\n\nHe is currently building microservices in Ruby running on cloud based infrastructure.Adam also flies the flag for his beloved Essendon Football Club in sunny Perth.\n\nFor more on YOW!
