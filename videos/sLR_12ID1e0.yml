description: "What have cats got to tell us about Software Architecture? Well, most people are roughly familiar with cats, their boundaries and their input/output mechanisms. It turns out it’s very easy to see when a use case has gone wrong when using a cat. We’ll take a look at some typical cat use cases and see what lessons we can take back software architecture.\n\nJoin me for an irreverent look at Coupling and Cohesion, Aggregate Roots and the Point of Highest Abstraction … all using the medium of cats.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks, courses, and conferences in the following links:\nhttps://ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
