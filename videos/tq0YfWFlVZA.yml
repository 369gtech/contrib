description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2016\n—\nAt Facebook we use C++ extensively in our backend and core infrastructure. We've recently added static reflection support for C++ to Thrift, in expectation of a first class standardized solution. \n\nThis talk demonstrates the power of reflection as a productivity enhancer, an enabler for features and an aid in managing complexity. It shows some useful functionalities that can be easily achieved through reflection in a portable and elegant way, which weren't possible before without code repetition, complex DSLs or non-portable pre-processors. \n\nWe'll cover things like pretty printers, data converters, migration to typed APIs, serialization and compilation times.\n\nREQUIREMENTS: intermediate to advanced knowledge of template meta-programming. This talk is not aimed at people who want to learn meta-programming.\n— \nMarcelo Juchem\nSoftware Engineer, Facebook\nMarcelo is a Software Engineer working with core infrastructure at Facebook.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
