title: 'Jesse Cravens - Art and Science of Shipping Single Page Apps with Ember.js'
recordingDate: 1429631087
description: "Jesse is the Director of Front End Engineering at Invision and a technical author for O’Reilly Media. As early as 2005, he began to focus on JavaScript and the evolution of the web browser as an application platform. In 2007 at a contract position with a large insurance company began a journey of leading projects with a focus on complex UIs in Fortune 200 enterprises.\n\nThroughout the years, he has tackled some of the most common challenges presented by implementing ambitious web UIs in enterprise environments: lack of JavaScript and front-end expertise, server-centric web legacies, cross-browser and mobile-web fragmentation compatibility requirements, lack of development tooling for front end developers, and the nascency, or absence, of client MVC toolsets, binding libraries, client side ORMs, JavaScript templates, promises and web components.\n\nThrough these experiences, and alongside the maturation of technical options, he’s developed a unique approach to shipping SPAs, that he divides into both an art and a science. In doing so, he will also compare three of the most common SPA frameworks: Angular, Ember, and React/Flux.\n\nJesse Cravens\nDirector of Front End Engineering, Invision\nhttps://twitter.com/jdcravens\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
