description: "Stephen Hemminger\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/172/\n\nPain cave is what Triathletes and cyclists call their indoor training setup. Programmable Ant+ Input Network for Community Alternative Velo Environment (PAIN CAVE) is my project to take fitness input (Ant+) and display the data in creative ways. As an avid indoor cyclist, I wanted a way to have lights and displays controlled by the level of effort. Most of the traditional fitness applications such as Garmin, Strava, and Zwift are closed source and PC centric with no ability for customization or creativity. PAIN CAVE is an alternative platform using Linux on Rasberry Pi and USB sensors to control LEDs and panels. This talk is about the process of making a project like this from the ground up.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
