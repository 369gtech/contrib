description: "This video was recorded at Scala Days Copenhagen 2017\nFollow us on Twitter @ScalaDays or visit our website for more information http://scaladays.org \n\nAbstract: \nIn July 2015 Facebook released the first draft of GraphQL specification. GraphQL provides an alternative to the REST API with a high emphasis on efficient data retrieval and introspection with a powerful type system behind it. It allows you to build the client applications based on highly decoupled components without sacrificing performance or over-/under-fetching a data. GraphQL is ideal for any application that requires very precise and performant data fetching/manipulation, like mobile applications. GraphQL type system is not only a perfect fit for scala applications, but it also opens a door for a brand new set of tools for API discovery, documentation, and code generation. In this talk I would like to give an introduction to GraphQL - the concepts behind it and how it addresses common API design challenges like versioning, documentation, and discovery. You will learn how you can start using GraphQL today in your scala applications with Sangria - a scala GraphQL implementation."
