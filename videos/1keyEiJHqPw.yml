description: "Google Test Automation Conference 2010\nOctober 28-29, 2010\n\n\"What Testability Tells us About the Software Performance Envelope\"\nPresented by Robert V. Binder, President, System Verification Associates.\n\nABSTRACT\n\nBroadly understood, testability defines the limits on producing and releasing complex systems with an acceptable risk of costly or dangerous defects.\n\nThis talk will explore testability, consider what we know about how it, and challenge the audience with some open problems.\n\n * Essential complexity and emergent behavior\n * The economics of software risk\n * Reliability: why debugging doesn't matter\n * Prevention: why it isn't enough\n * Testing Strategies: looking for love in all the wrong places?\n * Test automation paradigms: still looking for love in all the wrong places?\n * The Testing Performance Envelope: up to and beyond the edge\n\nRobert V. Binder is a software entrepreneur and technologist with over 34 years of systems engineering experience. His 1994 analysis of software testability http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=184077 has had a continuing influence on research and practice in this area. As principal of System Verification Associates, he leads teams that deliver advanced IT assurance solutions. He was recently awarded a U.S. Patent for a unique approach to model-based testing of mobile systems. He is a member of the Editorial Board of Software Testing, Verification, and Review and internationally recognized as the author of the definitive Testing Object-Oriented Systems: Models, Patterns, and Tools. Robert holds an MS in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from the University of Illinois at Chicago and a MBA from the University of Chicago. He is an IEEE Senior Member.\n\nSlides available at https://docs.google.com/leaf?id=0B4fT-BFGDnQkNTIxZmE5MDctYTJhZS00OThhLTkwY2QtNTk2OGQ4MjUzNWQx&sort=name&layout=list&pid=0B4fT-BFGDnQkYzVlMWY4M2EtYjRkYi00MDQ5LTg5ODUtNGQ4ZWU5N2NlMTRl&cindex=1"
