title: '"Tensorflow on open source GPUs" - David Airlie (LCA 2020)'
recordingDate: 1579268690
description: "David Airlie\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/27/\n\nOne of the biggest uses for GPU compute is AI/Machine Learning applications. The tensorflow library from Google is one of the most used frameworks in the AI/ML area. To deploy tensorflow on GPUs currently, the closed source nvidia stack is required using CUDA. This talk will explore the work done and left to do to enable a tensorflow deployment on open source Mesa drivers. The use of SYCL via LLVM and OpenCL along with work towards enabling OpenCL on a broader range of hardware will be discussed.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
