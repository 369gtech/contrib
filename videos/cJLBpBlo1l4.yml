description: "Remember the epic Java puzzlers? Here’s the Groovy version, and there are some neat ones! Even though it is totally a Grails shop, some of these had JFrog people scratching their head for days, trying to figure them out. And there is more! Contributions from the truly Groovy senseis, including @glaforge, @aalmiray, @tim_yates, and @kenkousen, make this session an unforgettable journey to Groovy’s O_O. You’ll get the expected dose of fun and enlightenment while hearing about mistakes and failures, great and small, in hard-core Groovy/Grails development.\n\n\nAuthors:\nBaruch Sadogursky\nBaruch Sadogursky (a.k.a JBaruch) is the Developer Advocate of JFrog, the creators of Artifactory Binary Repository, the home of Bintray, and JavaOne 2011 Duke Choice Awards winner.
