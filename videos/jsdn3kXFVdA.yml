In this talk, we'll cover many of the new features of the latest update of Visual Studio 2017 and give you a preview of new features coming in a major update later in 2017 that we've never shared before since you came to visit our hometown! We'll cover the ongoing evolution of our compiler and libraries, giving you an update on our conformance work as well as performance, and build throughput. We'll talk about the new enhancements to our Linux targeting. We'll talk about brand new unit testing capabilities for major test frameworks. We'll talk about improved support for CMake and our Open Folder experience for getting full Visual Studio IDE support for code that doesn't have a project or solution file. We'll also walk you through some cool new productivity and debugger features.\n— \nSteve Carroll: Visual C++ Development Manager, Microsoft Corporation \n\nSteve Carroll is the dev manager for the Visual C++ team and previously the dev manager for the Visual Studio debuggers and profilers.\n\nDaniel Moth: Group Program Manager, Microsoft\nVisual Studio\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
