And now with the inclusion of v3 features, Cloud Controller is changing into a more performant component within Cloud Foundry. \n\nFor those who are actively using and maintaining the platform, it is crucial to understand the internals of Cloud Controller and how it works. In this session, attendees will hear an overview of Cloud Controller and how it fits in the Cloud Foundry ecosystem. \n\nIf you have ever wondered how your source code turns into a running app or what the future of Cloud Controller looks like, this is a talk you won’t want to miss!\n\nSimon Leung\nSimon is one of the early Dojo program participant and has been working on varies Cloud Foundry projects for almost 3 years. Currently he is in CAPI team help pushing Cloud Controller features forward.\n\nUrvashi Reddy\nUrvashi Reddy is a Software Engineer at Pivotal.
