description: "In todayâ€™s rapidly expanding digital world, business transformation is essential for every type of business. Every organization needs to be a digital organization, powered by data, running in a multi-cloud world. While the essential infrastructure company, Dell Technologies, is helping customers shape their digital future, its IT organization has committed to its own digital transformation. Called the Dell Digital Way, this transformation, grounded in Pivotal Labs methodologies, is a cultural shift in how we partner with our business teams using a direct, simplified, and streamlined approach to quickly design, develop, iterate, and deliver new products and capabilities.\n\nIn this panel, four team members will reflect on their firsthand experiences with Dell Technologies' shift from Waterfall methodologies towards Agile development with a product mindset. An IT Leader, Experience Owner, Software Engineer, and Business Partner will share their unique perspective on embracing the Dell Digital Way. This conversation will highlight the reality of creating balanced teams and using Agile methodology to build better, test faster, and work seamlessly across these personas. Gain valuable insights from how their roles have changed, how they learned to work differently, what benefits were reaped, what didn't work, and lessons learned along the way.\n\nLearn more: https://pv.tl/2OZbK74\n\nSpeakers: Gregory Bowen, CTO/SVP, Dell Digital, Dell Technologies and Ritika Mehta, Full Stack Software Engineer, Dell and Harsh Acharya, Vice President, Global eCommerce, Dell Technologies\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2019\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/four-perspectives-one-product-mindset-a-retrospective-into-dell-its-digital-transformation"
