title: 'YOW! Lambda Jam 2018 -  Cameron Joannidis -  Free Monad and Free Applicative'
recordingDate: 1530838801
description: "The usage of Free Monads is becoming more well understood, however the lesser known Free Applicative is still somewhat of a mystery to the average functional programmer. In this talk I will explain how you can combine the power of both these constructs in an intuitive and visual manner. You will learn the motivations for using Free Structures in the first place, how we can build up a complex domain, how we can introduce parallelism into our domain and a bunch of other practical tips for designing programs with these structures. This will also give you a deeper understanding of what libraries like Freestyle are doing under the hood and why it is so powerful.\n\nCameron has been working with Big Data for several years and been involved with machine learning for even longer. He loves the practical application of data engineering and machine learning to solve real world problems. He also really enjoys functional programming (currently in Scala).\n\nFor more on YOW!
