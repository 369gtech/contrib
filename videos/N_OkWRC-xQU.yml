description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nThe Prometheus Conformance Program - Richard Hartmann, Grafana Labs\n\nPrometheus is the standard for cloud-native metric monitoring and beyond. We're a victim of our own success inasmuch as everyone claims to be compatible with Prometheus when many are not. In the best case, this leads to user confusion. In the worst case, this leads to data loss, data change, and missed alerts. In our experience as Prometheus team supporting end users, the latter is scarily common. To fix this situation, CNCF and Prometheus team have launched the Prometheus Conformance Program. We will walk through its design, through current test suites available, through current test results, and show you how to apply for the official mark of Prometheus compatibility. Depending on overall timeline, we might use this talk to publish official marks for projects and products."
