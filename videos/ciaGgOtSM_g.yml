description: "Presented by Chris Mendez at JSLA (js.la) Thursday July 25th, 2013\nIn 2012, the USC Radio online team set out to create a new type of music discovery app centered around geo location. After months of imagining, planning, developing and iterating, the team finally released Geotunes, an HTML5-based app that provides users with a new way to learn about the relationships between songs and their geographical surroundings. The presentation will take a birds-eye view of the product lifecycle and share what it took to become one of the first 100 apps on the Spotify app ecosystem.\n* twitter.com/chrisaiv\n* github.com/chrisaiv"
