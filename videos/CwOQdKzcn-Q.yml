description: "This online event was broadcast for Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane Data Engineering meetups. For more events like this join the crew near you at:\nhttps://www.meetup.com/Sydney-Data-Engineering-Meetup\nhttps://www.meetup.com/Melbourne-Data-Engineering-Meetup/\nhttps://www.meetup.com/Brisbane-Data-Engineering-Meetup/\n\nSpeakers:\nðŸŽ¤ Richard Morwood, Solutions Architect at Snowflake\nSemi-Structured Data in Snowflake\nIn this session we will show you how data is loaded in near real-time and stored in Snowflake, and made ready for fast querying. Next we'll explore how Snowflake deals with Semi-Structured Data and how we can perform advanced analysis over the top - without ever having to tell Snowflake the structure of our data\nRichard loves solving puzzles and storytelling. He loves his career as it enables him to combine both of these passions together by first exploring and analysing datasets to find how they fit together, then finding the best way to tell the story it holds. He is currently a Solution Architect with Snowflake, helping companies get the most out of their data fast and cost efficiently.\n\nðŸŽ¤ Fabian Hueske, Software Engineer at Ververica\nThe changing face of Flink SQL\nFour years ago, the Apache Flink community started adding SQL support to ease and unify the processing of static and streaming data. Today, Flink runs critical SQL-based applications at Alibaba, Huawei, Lyft, Uber, Yelp and many others.\nNew features and improvements are being added to Flink SQL at an increasing pace, not only to broaden the scope of use cases it supports, but also to make it more accessible to non-technical users. This year, several significant improvements and extensions were added, such as support for Change Data Capture (CDC) and integration with interactive notebooks. Itâ€™s time for an update!\nIn this talk, weâ€™ll demo whatâ€™s possible with Flink SQL in 2020. Based on a real-world use case, weâ€™ll show how to solve many common tasks with streaming SQL queries, including ingesting changelog streams, continuously maintaining materialized views and updating them in a relational DBMS. Weâ€™ll close the session with an outlook into the future of Flink SQL."
