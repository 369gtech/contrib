description: "This video was recorded at ElixirConf EU Virtual 2020 - https://www.elixirconf.eu/archives/virtual_2020/index.html\n\nMore great virtual tech conferences - https://codesync.global \n\n---\n\nAnatomy of a Real Time Elixir App\nby\nSteve Bussey\n\nABSTRACT\nIn this session, Stephen will show us how a real-time Elixir app works—from client to server. What does it mean to have a “real-time” web application? What communication layers can be used (WebSocket, SSE) and how are they used in real-time apps? How does a JavaScript client connect to the server? How does the Elixir server work, and what makes it great for real-time apps? This talk includes snippets of much of the code that powers Channels (and also LiveView), so you can see how it works first-hand.\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - Steve Bussey\n\nSteve is a software architect based in Atlanta, GA. He loves building software, from frontend applications powered by vanilla JS / React, to server applications powered by Elixir or Ruby. He also leaves teaching and empowering others to find their success in the software industry. Steve is the author of \"Real-Time Phoenix: Build Highly Scalable Systems with Channels\" by Pragmatic Bookshelf. He believes that real-time applications can offer important user experience improvements and enjoys writing about it.\n\n---\n\nElixirConf EU\nWebsite: https://www.elixirconf.eu/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ElixirConfEU"
