description: "http://www.cppcon.org\n--\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2014\n--\nToday most PCs, tablets and phones support multi-core processors and most programmers have some familiarity with writing (task) parallel code. Many of those same devices also have GPUs but writing code to run on a GPU is harder. Or is it?\n\nGetting to grips with GPU programming is really about understanding things in a data parallel way. This talk will look at some of the common patterns for implementing algorithms on today's GPUs using examples from the C++ AMP Algorithms Library. Along the way it will cover some of the unique aspects of writing code for GPUs and contrast them with a more conventional code running on a CPU.\n--\nAde Miller writes C++ for fun. He wrote his first N-body model in BASIC on an 8-bit microcomputer 30 years ago and never really looked back. He started using C++ in the early 90s. \n\nRecently, he's written two books on parallel programming with C++; \"C++ AMP: Accelerated Massive Parallelism with Microsoft Visual C++\" and \"Parallel Programming with Microsoft Visual C++\". Ade spends the long winters in Washington contributing to the open source C++ AMP Algorithms Library and well as a few other projects. His summers are mostly spent crashing expensive bicycles into trees.\n--\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
