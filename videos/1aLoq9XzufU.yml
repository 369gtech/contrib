title: 'Julka Grodel - "The Variable Crimes We Commit Against JavaScript"'
language: English
recordingDate: 1499042562
description: "Have you ever put a value into a JavaScript variable, and then been unable to use it where you needed it? Or created it and unintentionally overridden something you thought wouldn't be affected? JavaScript has an unusual way of handling where variables are available, we call this \"where\" a scope. In this talk, we'll go over how JavaScript variables 'bubble' up into higher scopes, how to restrict them to just where you want them, and how this affects variables in your functions.\n\n\nJulka Grodel is a Senior Software Engineer at AddThis and has worked professionally in web development for over 10 years. She is passionate about writing easily maintainable and extendable code and is on a mission to make it simple to use AddThis' social tools on single page apps and within a dynamic DOM. Julka spends most of her time on open source projects integrating AddThis tools for various JavaScript frameworks & content management systems. When not working, she spends her time volunteering with the Junior League, in a pilates studio, or doting over her blind cat Batman and his BFF Robin."
