Within the training team, they offer a Kotlin native workshop, for which Garth and Eamonn wrote a Kotlin native version of the classic game Breakout.\nBeing massive TypeScript fans, it would always be their language of choice when working on JavaScript platforms. They didn't feel the drive to switch to other languages that transpile to JS such as Fable (F#), Scala.js, or even KotlinJS, as they always saw Kotlin on the JVM as the solution to a problem, the problem being Java.\nThey will make use of React, Redux and use React Three Fiber for WebGL graphics. Moreover, they will explore what this transition to KotlinJS is like for a TypeScript fanboy and try to answer some questions along the way.\nYou'll learn how the tooling, libraries and language features compare, what things tripped up and whether you should switch and use it on [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n03:29 Experiment: Is KotlinJS worth it?\n10:12 Round 1: Community\n14:21 Round 2: Interop with JavaScript\n17:46 Round 3: JSX vs DSL\n29:34 Round 4: Async await vs coroutines\n32:02 Round 5: Elegant syntax\n34:22 Conclusion\n36:17 Game changer 1: Potential new language features\n37:31 Game changer 2: Compose for web\n38:35 Outro\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotocph.com/2021/sessions/1895/a-typescript-fans-kotlinjs-adventures\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nDan Vanderkam • Effective TypeScript • https://amzn.to/3DBmCib\nNathan Rozentals • Mastering TypeScript • https://amzn.to/2V4LYUt\nVenkat Subramaniam • Programming Kotlin • https://amzn.to/2MIC8D1\nVenkat Subramaniam • Functional Programming in Java • https://amzn.to/3bzFNNQ\nVenkat Subramaniam • Pragmatic Scala • https://amzn.to/3oIEq35\nVenkat Subramaniam • Test-Driving JavaScript Applications • https://amzn.to/3i9CbmW\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#KotlinJS #TypeScript #Kotlin #JSX #DSL #Coroutines #AsyncAwait #Programming #ProgrammingLanguages #FunctionalProgramming #Fable #Scala #ScalaJS #React #Redux\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
