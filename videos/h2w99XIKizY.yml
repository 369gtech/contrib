title: 'Simon Brugman & Ian Eves -  Visions an open source library for semantic data | PyData Global 2020'
language: English

description: "Talk \nMany common data workflows rely on semantically meaningful representations of data types. Lacking these, type inference algorithms (e.g. those used by pandas & the tidyverse) employ fragile, rule-based heuristics which complicate programming logic and expressiveness. This talk will explore ways to leverage the power of expressive semantic data types using the visions library.\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
