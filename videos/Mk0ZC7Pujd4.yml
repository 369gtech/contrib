description: "Full Title: Click logs and insights: Putting the search experts in your audience to work\n\nMore: https://berlinbuzzwords.de/session/click-logs-and-insights-putting-search-experts-your-audience-work\n\n(User, Query, Document) - This simple tuple helps give shape and depth to the often flat information retrieval landscape. With a few quick transformations, this dataset can help you suggest query completions, display related queries, propose synonym candidates, generate taste profiles, and forecast demand. This talk will help search engineers and product owners to get a feel for the data relationships created by this useful feedback loop. (Note that while many of these product features can be further optimized using ML, this talk requires no previous knowledge of machine learning applications in search.)"
