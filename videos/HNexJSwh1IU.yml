description: "Bio:\n\nYuriy Chulovskyy is Java developer from Ukraine with experience in web analytic domain. He likes mentoring and trying new languages/frameworks. At the same time he believes that most of the issues are not in technical but in environmental and social areas.\n\n\nPresentation:\nWhy developers don't test\nLanguage: EN\n\nHow often did you meet a situation when everybody knows about an issue, at retrospective everybody agrees that it should be resolved, but next retrospective brings the same issue and the same action items? Why team of mature developers cannot change a situation on a project, cannot apply new practices or fail to apply innovations? Let me explain it on real project example and get you to the root cause, go from best practices to basic principles and back."
