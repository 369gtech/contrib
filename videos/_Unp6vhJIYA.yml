description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2016\n—\nI started writing my own Content Managment System for Meeting C++ last year. One of the goals for this project is to seperate the Qt GUI code from the layer that handles the logic and data storage, written in modern C++ and boost. This presentation will focus on my usage of modern C++ to implement the CMS.\n\nToday my CMS has a little bit more then 10k loc, uses boost extensively and has a Qt GUI as the user facing frontend. In this talk I will focus on how boost powers the application and where I had to find my own solutions. I knew that with boostache there is a library for text templates, which later also inspired me to write a generic layer to use JSON for import and data storage in my CMS. The resulting generic_json library is currently a prototype, but a very interesting idea: uniting several json libraries into one interface. This way my own code is not hard wired to a specific JSON library.\n— \nJens Weller\nMeeting C++\nC++ Evangelist\nJens Weller is the organizer and founder of Meeting C++. Doing C++ since 1998, he is an active member of the C++ Community. From being a moderator at c-plusplus.de and organizer of his own C++ User Group since 2011 in Düsseldorf, his roots are in the C++ Community. Today his main work is running the Meeting C++ Platform (conference, website, social media and recruiting). His main role has become being a C++ evengalist, as this he speaks and travels to other conferences and user groups around the world.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
