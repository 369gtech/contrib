description: "As Designer we strive to create interfaces that are intuitive and unobtrusive. Sometimes that means we struggle with a good distinction between unconcious guidance and user consent, especially as machine learning and context detection are potentially being introduced into the design ecosystem. This talk will cover some of the obvious as well as hidden challenges designers face as interfaces evolve, from touch interfaces, to voice commands up to the horizon of brain-machine interfaces. \n\nSonja Rattay is a Berlin-born multi disciplinary designer, currently based in Malmö, where she co-founded the strategic design studio Block Zero and currently leads the UX team. Her work ranges from creating immersive fashion technology exploring the perceptual senses of the human body to UX for embodied interaction and creating machines with personality. Title: The Brain and the Interface. How to design for empowered users while tapping into unconscious behaviour. \n__________________________\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry in the Malmö/Lund region.
