description: "What if you’re eating and having a discussion about a certain topic? Searching on your phone would mean your food gets cold. Or what if you’re lying on the couch without your phone and you want to control the lights? The voice recognition service called Alexa can solve those issues.\n\nIn this presentation I will show you how to integrate Alexa in your home automation setup with openHAB. That way you can control your lights and everything else with your voice. openHAB is used as an example, you can use Alexa with almost any software and hardware.\n\nLast but not least I will show you how to create your own skills in Java to add functionality to Alexa. The skills are deployed with Maven to AWS Lambda as a serverless application. One of the examples connects an Alexa skill to a Spring Boot application running on AWS Lambda."
