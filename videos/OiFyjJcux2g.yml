description: "Scala can be really complicated, and it’s normal that you don’t know how to start learning it. So it really simple to miss possibilities for the beginners to learn Scala effectively.\n\nThis talk is about what tools and practices can be used for the beginners. We will observe Scala Worksheet and its practices. We also will make a review for the most common mistakes in Scala code. Moreover I’ll tell you about refactoring tools and implicits debug tools. This talk will have some introduction to Scala, so any knowledge of this language is not required.\n\nAll of this will help people, who want to start learning Scala, to do it in more effective way and it also will help people, who already know Scala, to use it in more powerful way."
