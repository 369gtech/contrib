title: 'Gotchas using Terraform in a secure delivery pipeline - Anton Babenko'
recordingDate: 1535546250
description: "When using Terraform for some time developers need to go through questions of handling security, locking, state conflicts, rollbacks, versioning and few more, while trying to implement infrastructure as code and automate as much as possible by the way. The created solution can eventually grow to a big ball of mud. Why?\nDuring the talk, I will explain how to integrate Terraform in a secure continuous delivery pipeline and weâ€™ll make a deep-dive into related gotchas.\n\nMore specifically I will explain how to manage AWS infrastructure in a secure way using Terraform and how to solve common problems which occur when using Terraform in a team. \n\nThis talk will be based on practical experience of using Terraform for 2,5 years.\n\nBy the end of my talk participants will become familiar with gotchas and will be able to implement Terraform into their delivery pipeline more easily, because there will be at least a couple of real implementations I have made in the past (including the code which I will release on GitHub)."
