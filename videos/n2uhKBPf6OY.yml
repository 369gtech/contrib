language: English
recordingDate: 1608170408
description: "The year 2020 changed the way we work and how we look at the current status quo. Like everybody else, we had to adapt to a fast-changing environment, face hard reality, and act to make a positive difference. We don't always know the right thing to do, but we'd like to share what we tried, added, and changed in the way we approach our work.\n\nSpeaker: Mariko Kosaka\n\nSubscribe to Google Chrome Developers here → https://goo.gle/ChromeDevs\nWatch all Chrome Developer Summit sessions here → https://goo.gle/cds20-sessions\n\n#chromedevsummit #chrome #remotework"
