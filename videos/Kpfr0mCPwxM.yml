recordingDate: 1523569122
description: "Let’s face it: sometimes things go bad, real bad. How do you overcome these challenges? How do you avoid\_these obstacles? In this session, learn from past real-life challenges and how to be proactive so that your project plan stays successful from discovery to fruition and your project team stays happy and motivated.\n\n“Normal-sized” Drupal projects provide ample opportunities for failure. Drupal projects for large enterprise customers add even more complexity: managing multiple initiatives, partners, stakeholders and product owners.\n\nWhen you’re working with round-the-clock, globally distributed teams, it’s critical that everyone understands the part they need to play. When executing projects of this scale, it can become challenging for Drupal project managers and technical architects to maintain development velocity and efficient agile workflows.\n\nSet yourself up for success by learning from others. Know what to look for so you can be an educated, thoughtful leader of any project.\n\nSpecifically, we’ll demonstrate a series of examples of what NOT to do, so that you may learn how to:\n\nInstitute key elements of communication that uphold the agile process\n\nApply elements of good team management: from delivery and infrastructure support to product owner and stakeholder\n\nUphold technical best practices when working with multiple development teams\n\nEncourage use of key tools and practices to keep your project humming"
