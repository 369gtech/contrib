description: "Google Tech Talk\nMay 28, 2013\n(more info below)\n\n\nABSTRACT\n\nJohn O'Duinn, Director of Release Engineering at Mozilla kicked off ICSE 2013 with his keynote - Release Engineering as a Force Multiplier. The build and release process used to be a pain point at Mozilla, but now makes the company and community more productive as a whole. John will describe details on how the team added support for concurrent development, rethought continuous integration and increased capacity by moving to a hybrid-cloud build infrastructure. These changes improved several aspects of the business, including switching to a rapid release model and reducing turnaround time on a release from weeks to hours.  As a result,  Mozilla improved its abilities against much bigger and better funded competitors in the marketplace while also allowing them to enter new markets and help ensure its long-term success.\n\nJohn O'Duinn is the Director of Release Engineering at the Mozilla Corporation.\n\nThis Google tech talk was hosted by Boris Debic."
