description: "A Principled Approach to Monitoring Streaming Data Infrastructure at Scale\n\nEric Schow and Praveen Yedidi, CrowdStrike\n\nWe ingest over a trillion events per day into our cloud platform and it is very important that this platform is available, operational, reliable, and maintainable.\n\nIn creating a comprehensive monitoring strategy for our data processing platform, we found it strategic to model our platform's efficiency and resilience along two axes—complexity of implementation and engineer experience—from which we can define four quadrants—observability, operability, availability, and quality.\n\nIn this talk, we present how we've employed this four-quadrant model to establish key indicators and enforceable quality SLAs in order to improve the resilience of our cloud platform while reducing operational complexity.\n\nView the full SREcon21 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon21/program"
