description: "Shakeup and Speedup. Shifting up the Innovation Funnel\r (for businesses that want to change and innovate faster)\r\n\nStarting new teams and scaling up innovation is more important than ever. The key to success is applying different practices in different stages of the innovation lifecycle. What works for a new business does not work for a mature one, and vice versa. In this talk, we will nosedive into the major good practices for business leaders and product teams, from the moment they have an innovative idea to the day they will scale it up (or screw it up). Everything depends on the lifecycle stage of the new product or service.\n\nTopics can include (depending on available time): Business Lifecycle, Shiftup Model, Problem/Solution Fit, Product/Market Fit, Lean Personas, Jobs To Be Done, Value Proposition Wheel, Pains and Gains, Lean Experiments, Minimum Viable Product, Business Model Canvas, Lean Canvas, Innovation Cycle, North Star Metric, Product Roadmaps, Customer Journey Maps, Business Funnel, Pirate Metrics, Growth Hacking, Growth Board, Innovation Funnel."
