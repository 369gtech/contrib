description: 'We automated our deployment pipelines. We do blue/green and canary deployments. Now we need the next step to reach another level of software releases. Now we want to test our business hypothesis. Two different approaches outstand in this area: smart routers and feature toggles. We’ll have it covered. Come to this session to see lots of demos and deployments with smart routers and feature toggles to check how effective A/B testing can be achieved.
