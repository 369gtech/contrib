description: "Anatolij Grigorjev presentation in Online Meetup –„Principas Nr. 9: nuolatinis dėmesys meistriškumui“.\n\nAnatolij is a passionate software engineer, which is using code to try and solve problems for about a decade. Sometimes he gets paid for it. Worked at a medium-sized old-guard LT IT company, a startup-style code agency, and now ended up in a large enterprise bank.\n\nWhat’s the talk about:\n\nSpeaker will provide examples of the 9th principle about good design in practice, showing why good design is more important that fast design and how it can go wrong when this is avoided. He will try to explain why he see why these ideas were put together into the manifesto that they did and how they can be applied by regular nine to five developers.\n\nPresentation slides: http://bit.ly/Anatolij_slides\n---\nOther meetings presentations:\nhttps://bit.ly/Pavel_pranešimas\nhttps://bit.ly/Tado_pranešimas"
