description: "In this talk, Harley explains the basics of raymarching -- a powerful technique that can be used to draw 3D scenes with a pixel shader. By using signed distance functions, we can describe the geometry of a scene in a succinct mathematical form. Raymarching allows us to step rays closer and closer to our geometry until we intersect and then colour our pixels according to our shading model. This technique is vastly expressive. Scenery from cityscapes to natural landscapes can be produced by aggregating simple mathematical rules. With surprisingly few mathematical operations, you can create remarkable variety, and by supplying temporal inputs like music and motion, you can create procedurally evolving scenery.\n\nEVENT:\n\nThis talk was given at Linux.conf.au 2018 (LCA2018) which was held on 22-26 January 2018 in Sydney Australia.\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nHarley Mellifont\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyiCoRZTYS8"
