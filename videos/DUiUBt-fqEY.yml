description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2018\n—\nDesigning and building the runtime reflection system from tomorrow, today! \n\nWith the introduction of libraries like LLVM and libclang, building \ncustom tools for C++ is more approachable than it has ever been before. \nWith Clang we have a fantastic tool to analyze and augment the C++ \nAST without writing our own compiler or parser. \n\nIn this talk we'll go over the design and implementation of a \nruntime reflection system, demonstrating the use of Clang and the \nLLVM framework to craft custom C++ tools for your own needs. \nWe'll be able to query the members of a class, inspect their types and \nsize, as well as qualifiers and user-definable flags. To show-case a \nreal-world usage of the solution, we'll add a way to easily serialize \nany class to or from a byte stream, by making use of the reflection \ninformation. The implementation is available under a permissive \nopen-source license on Github (https://github.com/leandros/metareflect). \n— \nArvid Gerstmann\nArvid Gerstmann is a passionate programmer and computer enthusiast, with a focus on writing high-performance C++ systems. His area of expertise includes writing compilers, standard libraries and game engines.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
