title: 'Let''s explore the Cypress testing framework'
recordingDate: 1601622450
description: "For years there has been a noticeable disconnect between testing and development. Testing meant very different things to different people.\n\nUnit testing was the developers domain all testing beyond this was conducted in silo by teams of testers. But something has changed and now the desire for continuous delivery has meant that testing time frames have been squeezed and the line between dev & test seems has become more blurred.\n\nCypress, an open sourced web test automation solution, is leading the charge on this front. A self-professed tool written by developers for developers (and of course testers).\n\nIn this session we will look at how cypress can be utilised by testers & developers to write end-to-end tests for modern web applications.\n\n## About Ryan\n\nI’m Ryan, A software Test engineer with a decade of experience testing full stack software applications. I’m the founder of How QA, a software testing consultancy start up and the co-organiser of the East Anglia Quality Assurance meetup."
