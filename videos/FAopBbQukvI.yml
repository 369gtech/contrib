description: "In the current landscape of web development, Single Page Applications (SPA) have been utilized more frequently due to its versatile capabilities. Also, popularity of frameworks such as Angular and React have enabled fast paced development of SPAs. For that reason, even more traditional web applications have migrated to SPAs without considering the security implications this new paradigm introduces. In this presentation we will describe some of the security pitfalls that affect SPA applications and how to mitigate them.\n\nSpeaker\n\nRafael Dreher\nSecurity Software Engineer, Microsoft\nRafael Dreher is a Security Engineer at Microsoft and co-founder of OWASP Porto Alegre chapter.
