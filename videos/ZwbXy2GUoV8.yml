Clustering data into subsets is an important task for many data science applications. It is considered as one of the most important unsupervised learning technique. \nThis video includes the following topics:\n\n1. What is Clustering?\n2. Why Clustering?\n3. Clustering Algorithm classification\n4. Similarity/Dissimilarity Measurement\n5. Difference between Euclidean and Manhattan\n6. Cosine Distance Measure\n7. K-Means Clustering\n8.
