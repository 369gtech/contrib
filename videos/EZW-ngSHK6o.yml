description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2013 in Santa Clara, CA\nSpeaker: John Hann\nSo you've been toying around with JavaScript. You have a basic feel for the language but don't quiet feel productive, yet. If so, this talk is for you. We'll peel away the abstractions, libraries, and frameworks to uncover the more interesting fundamentals of JavaScript. Specifically, we'll delve into the following:\n\n    Prototypal inheritance (and alternatives to classical inheritance)\n    Closures\n    Scope versus context and this\n    Public vs privileged vs private variables\n    Modules\n    Promises / Futures\n    Recent improvements from EcmaScript 5 and 6\n    Functional programming strategies\n    Documentation using JSDoc\n    Testing strategies\n    and more!"
