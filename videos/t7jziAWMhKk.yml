description: "Slides: http://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/transforming-the-monolith-at-20m-tph\n\nWithin the Enterprise Services Team at Comcast, we have a platform that handles x million transactions a day. Over the course of a year we transformed from large monolithic deployments with cycle times of anything from 90 days to a series of lean and agile teams with cycle times measured in hours. \n\nWe achieved this through cultural and technological transformations. Our culture changed from one of individual siloed development to cross-functional teams embracing Agile methods, our technology changed from heavy application server platforms on bare metal to PaaS using Cloud Foundry, from disjointed and manual builds to continuous delivery. This is our story.\n\nSpringOne Platform 2016 \nSpeaker: Nick Beenham; Senior Principal Engineer, Comcast"
