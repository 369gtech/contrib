language: English
recordingDate: 1446767393
description: "Carmen DeArdo, DevOps Technology Leader, Nationwide Insurance\n\nThe Nationwide Journey started with setting up agile development standing teams. With over 200 agile teams in place across the enterprise, significant quality and productivity improvements were realized. However it soon became obvious that we were reaching a point of diminishing returns due to wait states and contentions points in other areas of the delivery value stream.\n\nAt this point it became necessary to perform more analysis to determine how additional DevOps practices could be applied as part of a Lean Application Development Initiative. This required people (culture), process and technology changes. The application of DevOps practices providing continuous visibility and delivery, was a key component of optimizing the end to end delivery value stream.\n\nThis session will discuss where the journey picks up from last year and how continued application of DevOps methods is transforming our ability to deliver key business capabilities more quickly and predictably."
