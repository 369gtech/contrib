title: 'Erlang does Nuclear Physics - Controlling Medium Scale Nuclear Physics Experiments - Jared Kofron'
recordingDate: 1366194587
description: "Erlang Factory SF Bay Area 2013\nMore info and slides on the website: http://www.erlang-factory.com/conference/SFBay2013/talks\n\nNuclear physics experiments are centered around hardware - from power supplies to data acquisition hardware and everything in between. Not surprisingly, Erlang is a very natural fit for monitoring and controlling the hardware which is dedicated to those experiments. I will discuss two instances in which Erlang has been used to this purpose - one large scale and one medium scale experiment - and share stories and lessons learned on the battlefield of Physics."
