description: "AWS Lambda is a service from Amazon AWS for real-time data processing over large, distributed data streams. Amazon Kinesis can continuously capture and store terabytes of data per hour from hundreds of thousands of sources such as website clickstreams, financial transactions, social media feeds, IT logs, and location-tracking events.\n\nYou can think of Kinesis as a managed version of Apache Kafka but there are important differences.\n\nThis talk will give you an overview of the high level architecture, the programming model and a real world example."
