description: "Google Tech Talk\nNovember 3, 2010\n\nPresented by Victoria Van Voorhis.\n\nABSTRACT\n\nVictoria Van Voorhis of Rochester, NY based Second Avenue Software will discuss the challenges in taking serious games and interactive media from the margins to the mainstream across the K-16 spectrum.   Her essential question is why, given the efficacy data that we have about serious games, aren't they being integrated into the educational experience of today's students?  Drawing on her years as a classroom educator, a leader in creating new media for integration into school curricula, and a business strategist she will offer a unique and multi-faceted perspective.    Van Voorhis believes that solving the challenges of design and implementation of serious games are essential to scaling the potential learning outcomes.  More importantly, she observes that serious games have not been developed with business models informed by effective publishing and financial sustainability strategies. Van Voorhis will provide suggestions for addressing these issues while focusing on the proven learning outcomes games offer K-16 educators and students.\n\nAbout the speaker:  Victoria Van Voorhis has worked in the education and technology industry for more than 15 years.
