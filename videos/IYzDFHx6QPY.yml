description: "Don't forget to check out our links below!\nhttps://ndcporto.com/\nhttps://ndcconferences.com/\n\nWe are all familiar with example-based testing, as typified by TDD and BDD, where each test is hand-crafted.\n\nBut there's another approach to writing tests. In the \"property-based testing\" approach, a single test is run hundreds of times with randomly generated inputs. Property-based testing is a great way to find edge cases, and also helps you to understand and document the behavior of your code under all conditions.\n\nThis talk will introduce property-based testing, show you how it works, and demonstrate why you should consider adding this powerful technique to your toolbelt."
