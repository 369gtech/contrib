description: "Speaker : Frédéric Harper\n\nWhy should you, a competent software developer or programmer, care about your own brand? After all, it’s not like you’re an actor or musician. In fact, as Success in Programming: How to Gain Recognition, Power, and Influence Through Personal Branding demonstrates in many ways, it’s never been more important for you to think about yourself as a brand. Doing so will provide rocket fuel for your career. You’ll find better jobs and become the “go-to” person in various situations. You’ll become known for your expertise and leadership, and you’ll find it easier to strike out on your own. People will seek out your advice and point of view. You’ll get paid to speak, write, and consult. What’s not to like about becoming a rock star developer?"
