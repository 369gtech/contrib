recordingDate: 1493255507
description: "Blockchains have received a lot of media attention recently and are being explored by a range of organizations from financial services to NGOs. A blockchain can provide an immutable layer of trust to web applications by being a distributed ledger that is a tamper-proof history of all transactions sent to it.\n\nIn this session I present a initial approach integrating the Ethereum blockchain with Drupal. While blockchain is a peer-to-peer technology that can be used in fully decentralized p2p architectures, I would like to explore a semi-decentralized Drupal architecture that can still provide the benefit of trusted transactions within a group of known participants–which can be Drupal User Accounts.\n\nThis talk aims to answer Dries' question “What the Blockchain mean for a CMS like Drupal?” and provide an overview of the following:\n\nBlockchains\nCurrent state of blockchain applications\nWhat role Drupal might play in blockchain tech\nDrupal Ethereum Module: Current State and Roadmap\nEthereum is an open source blockchain platform that is programmable via smart contracts. These are programs deployed to and executed on the blockchain that can enforce simple agreements between parties about resources represented. Decentralized applications that integrate smart contracts have wide applicability to digital identity, IoT, voting, asset tracking, revenue models for digital content, public and private records and more. Integration with Drupal would allow organizations to integrate Ethereum into their user registries workflows and begin to explore blockchain's benefits.\n\n\nMy Slides\_slides.com/digitaldonkey/drupal-ethereum"
