description: "The collaboration between business and technology while building digital products is still not as close as it should be. This lack of close collaboration and common understanding that product and software design mutually impact each other leads to badly designed systems that can constrain business evolution.\n\nIn this video, Codurance co-founder Sandro presents helpful techniques on how a more collaborative way of working can be achieved, in order to align product and software design.\n\nThis video was recorded at SCLConf 2019, an annual conference for software professionals that care about their craft.
