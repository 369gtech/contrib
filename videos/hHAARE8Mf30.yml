description: "\"Data Structures & Algorithms\" is a subject every programmer needs to master in order pass coding interviews for big tech companies and write efficient code. I remember preparing for job interviews years ago by reading books like \"Cracking the Coding Interview\" and practicing on sites like LeetCode. I know that many of you are going through this right now. So in this 1 hour live game show, 1 winner will receive a $100 cash prize (in bitcoin) by following along as i solve several DS&A problems and answering 3 related questions interactively. I'll also freestyle a musical performance for them. Who will be the greatest programmer of them all and achieve Victory Royale? Find out this Friday at 8 AM PST/9:30 PM IST!\n\nPlease Subscribe! And Like. And Comment. That's what keeps me going.\n\nAnswer questions via: https://itempool.com/llsourcell/live"
