title: '[DevFest Nantes 2019] How to Build Cloud Native CI CD Pipelines with Tekton on Kubernetes'
language: French
recordingDate: 1572525642
description: "Speaker : Vincent Demeester\n\nAcross the software industry a common thread in modern projects is the need for continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD). Modern microservice architectures require reliable multi-environment CI/CD automation. There are a gamut of technologies addressing the need for CI/CD solutions. However, we struggle to get the right fit for our use cases. Traditional solutions tend to be rigid and resource hungry.\n\nThis is where Tekton, a flexible Kubernetes-native open-source CI/CD framework, which automates deployments across multiple platforms (Kubernetes, serverless, VMs), plays a crucial role. Tekton, hosted by the CD Foundation, aspires to be the common denominator in CI/CD, modeling what Kubernetes has become in Cloud-Native Application development.\n\nThis talk focuses on the Tekton Pipelines workflow, building blocks, and how you can tailor CI/CD solutions. It also covers the use of Tekton CLI and the Tekton Kubernetes Operator for effective life cycle management of CI/CD pipelines."
