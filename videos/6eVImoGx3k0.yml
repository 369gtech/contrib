description: 'Creating a Secure Supply Chain of images is vitally important. Every organization needs to weigh ALL options available and understand the security risks. With so many options for images, it is tough to pick the right ones or even to create your own. Ultimately, every organization needs to know the provenance of all the images. Then once the images are imported into the infrastructure, a vulnerability scan is vital. Docker Trusted Registry with Image Scanning will give organizations insight into any vulnerabilities. Better yet, its automated with a succinct audit trail, so you can still take that vacation you had planned and make your security team happy.'
