title: 'Delegates in C# - A practical demonstration, including Action and Func'
language: English
recordingDate: 1527508803
description: "Delegates in C# are really powerful but most people don't know how to use them effectively, if at all. Today I am going to show you what delegates are, how to use them, why they are useful, and really how to take your code to the next level. Along the way, I will cover the special types of delegates named Func and Action. Now if all of these new words seem intimidating, don't worry. This topic is actually really simple at its foundation. Yes, you can do some complex things with delegates but an actual delegate is absolutely simple.\n\nSource Code: https://leadmagnets.app/?Resource=DelegatesInCSharp\nPatreon: https://patreon.com/IAmTimCorey\nNewsletter signup:  https://signup.iamtimcorey.com/"
