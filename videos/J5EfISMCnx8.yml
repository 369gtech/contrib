description: 'Scala language is not a new kid on the block. It was released more than ten years ago and become quite a popular choice among the developers to create the highly scalable top notch performance solutions. There is a lot of information floating around on how to use it properly both as a written documentation, such as books and articles, and as online courses, most famous available on Coursera. There is, however, an amazing lack of a good documentation on how to use it improperly to create more fun for the people supporting the systems and ensure the excellent job security for the authors. This talk tries to address this gap. The presentation is inspired by a famous essay of Roedy Green.'
