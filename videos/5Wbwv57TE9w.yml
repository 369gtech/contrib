title: 'Robert Žuljevi? - Real-time Stream Processing With Samza'
recordingDate: 1445386325
description: 'Everything around us happens in real-time, why should it be processed in batches? Whether it’s the latest neighborhood gossip, the newest headlines or page-views, some events need to be reacted to as they happen. In this talk, we’ll try and see how to do just that – using Apache Samza. Apache Samza is an open source distributed framework for processing and analyzing data streams. It consists of three layers for: Streaming, Execution and Processing. Out of the box Samza comes with support for Apache Kafka (streaming) and Apache Hadoop YARN (execution). Built around well-known concepts Samza provides fault tolerance, durability, scalability, pluggability and isolation. On top of that Samza provides a very simple API – in contrast to most low-level messaging systems. These features make Samza ideal for any data processing that requires high availability, like fraud detection, real-time analytics and other similar systems.'
