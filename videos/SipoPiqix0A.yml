recordingDate: 1478941135
description: "This talk will explore our process for taking research algorithms into production as part of large-scale IoT systems. This will include our experiences developing a condition monitoring system for the Sydney Harbour Bridge, and case studies into some of the challenges we have faced. It will also cover general IoT challenges such as bandwidth limits, weatherproofing, and hardware lock-in, and how we have addressed them.\n\nBen Barnes - I write backend services in Scala for Data61â€™s Structural Information Systems group, though my background is in mechatronic engineering and robotics. After discovering Haskell and functional programming, I found I was fascinated by tools that can help us write correct software more easily. Since then I have been trying to apply these tools to my work.\n\nSandy Taylor - I am a Software Engineer working at Data61 as part of the Structural Information Systems team. Since joining Data61 at the beginning of 2015, my primary focus has been delivering a performant data collection, reporting and continuous monitoring system on top of existing research instrumentation on the Sydney Harbour Bridge. While i studied Mechatronics Engineering, recently I have been more focused on developing web / backend systems. I am now starting to work on our new greenfield cloud based platform for more generic monitoring purposes.\n\nFor more on YOW! Data, visit http://data.yowconference.com.au"
