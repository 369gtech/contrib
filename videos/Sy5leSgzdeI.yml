description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2014.\nSpeaker: Brian Cavalier\nWeb / JavaScript Track\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/efficient-clientserver-communication-with-differential-synchronization-and-json-patch\nThe world of client-server has changed. The traditional application of REST is no longer the best fit. We're depolying applications into a world where users expect responsive UIs, on all their devices, even while disconnected. We're deploying into a world where connection latency, mobile radio usage and battery life have become primary concerns.\n\nDifferential Synchronization (DS) is an algorithm that syncs data across N parties, even in the face of dropped connections, offline devices, etc. It makes more efficient use of connections by batching and sending only changes, in both directions, from client to server and from server to client. Weâ€™ll look at how it can be used with JSON Patch to synchronize application data between clients and servers over HTTP Patch, WebSocket, and STOMP, and how it can be integrated into the Spring ecosystem."
