description: "One of the challenging aspects of building modern games is making it multiplayer. \nCan we use HTTP there? We can, but we will not get a real-time game. \nCan we use WebSockets / TCP? Of course, we can and we should! \nHowever, developing API on top of WebSocket is another challenge that no one wants to solve, but everyone does.\n Existing libraries do not give us a required variety of communication models. \nToday we will show you the way to tackle this - using RSocket. RSocket is an application protocol that makes developing any networked application as easy as pie. To prove that, we are going to build a multiplayer Pac-Man, and during the process compare different ways of making a multiplayer game."
