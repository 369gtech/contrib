description: "Upcoming JS Conference:\r\nJS Fest 2020 - 3-4th of April, Kiev, Ukraine\r\nDetails and tickets: http://bit.ly/2EoHvQo\n\n\nThe talk from JS Fest conference in Kyiv, Ukraine.\nPresentation: https://www.slideshare.net/JSFestUA/js-fest-2018-anna-herlihy-how-to-write-a-compass-plugin\nFb: https://www.facebook.com/JSFestua/\nWebsite: http://jsfest.com.ua/\n\nCompass is a MongoDB user interface tool written for Electron using NodeJS and React. So what happens if a user has a feature request we canâ€™t support? We let them do it themselves! This talk is about how we implemented a plugin architecture for Compass so that users can write their own features. I will demo Compass, describe the plugin architecture, and then live-code an example plugin. Attendees who are interested in writing their own plugin architecture will learn about how we solved the specific problems with supporting external plugins in an Electron app. I will also explore the security implications of having third-party plugins and the unique challenges involved with supporting open-source plugins in a closed-source project. Writing a Compass plugin is a lot of fun, as well as a great way to get to know React, Node, MongoDB. Attendees will leave the talk with an understanding of how the Compass plugin architecture works and how to start writing their own plugin"
