description: "MobileOptimized 2020, Online â€“ November 6-7, 2020\n\nIndependent Features - Powered by Dagger Extensions, Yahya Bayramoglu\n\nEvery application consists of high level features which can be built completely isolated and independent, but what are the benefits of having independent features and when does it make sense to have them?\n\nThis talk will not only answer those questions, but also show why this was not entirely possible with vanilla Dagger and how new extensions both Hilt and Anvil (previously known as Hepheastus) solve this problem. You will see these libraries in action and learn about one of their core benefits."
