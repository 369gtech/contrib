description: "Building Reactive Microservices with .NET Core - Kevin Hoffman, Capital One\n\n This session is all about building reactive services in .NET Core. Kevin Hoffman explains how to deal with distributed transactions by designing around them with techniques like Event Sourcing, CQRS, and embracing eventual consistency. He will walk through a suite of services built with ASP.NET Core to illustrate these patterns, including consuming and publishing Kafka events, using Entity Framework Core to materialize views in Postgres, and more."
