title: 'YOW! CTO 2019 - Andrew Harvey - Your team as a distributed system'
recordingDate: 1582660800
description: "As we level up in technical roles, often we find ourselve thrust into team leadership and management. This sneaks up on us and we can be left without the skills to adequately understand, engage with and lead our teams. This inevitably has a negative effect on our teams and this effect is multiplied as you scale.\n\nWhat if we could reach into our toolbox that we use to understand technical problems – software architecture and distributed systems theory – to help us understand our teams? Could we learn to better manage people through this metaphor?\n\nWe will explore the dynamics of teams and how they map to our understanding of distributed systems. Using this understanding we can apply distributed systems theory to help unpick some of the dynamics of our teams and how to optimise them for scale.\n\nAndrew is the CTO in Residence for Microsoft for Startups in Sydney. He works with startups to help them scale their technology and their companies. Previously he was CTO at CancerAid & Zova, winning an Apple Design Award for Zova in 2016.\n\nFor more on YOW!
