description: "DOES18 Las Vegas - https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/from-dickens-devops-carmen-deardo/ “It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us…” Charles Dickens introduction to A Tale of Two Cities. Transformation journeys are not a linear path to success. At times I have used the above phrase to describe the spectrum of feelings present during a DevOps journey. There are incredible things that are happening by some of the leading, innovative teams. Things like reducing the time to run a test suite from hours to minutes. Or going from deploying once every 2-3 months to deploying 2-3 times a week or daily. Or being able to reduce the lead time of a story from creation to deployment from months to days. But at the same time, there remain challenges such as over governance of change control requiring more manual escalations, teams with too much WIP being interrupted by countless project meetings, and local optimizations being implemented which don’t improve our ability to deliver business value quickly. This talk will focus on the ebbs and flows and highs/lows of that journey using Dickens' Tale of Two Cities as a backdrop. It will provide a realistic message that is also hopeful and positive, of what one may expect to encounter and how leaders of these transformations can persevere.\n\nApplying Dickens to DevOps\n\nCarmen DeArdo, Senior VSM Strategist, Tasktop\n\nDevOps Transformation leader with expertise in the implementation of DevOps, Lean and Agile practices to improve software delivery across all Technologies. Recently worked on the implementation of DevOps practices to accelerate delivery at a Fortune 100 company.

My goal is to consult with other companies to help them determine how they can drive accelerated results across their delivery value stream.\n\nNamed as one of the top 100 DevOps Leaders ( http://techbeacon.com/100-devops-leaders-enthusiasts-experts-you-should-follow-today) and one of the 25 must follow enterprise DevOps leaders (https://techbeacon.com/25-must-follow-enterprise-devops-leaders-twitter).
