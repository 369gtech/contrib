description: "**Imagine a world where your phone, TV and computer could all communicate on a common platform. Imagine it was easy to add video chat to your web application. That's the vision of WebRTC.**\n\nWebRTC implements open standards for real-time, plugin-free video, audio and data communication.\n\nAs Brendan Eich put it: \"WebRTC is a new front in the long war for an open and unencumbered web.\" We believe WebRTC can democratise and decentralise tools for content creation and communication -- for telephony, gaming, video production, music making, news gathering and many other applications.\n\nIn this session show you how to use WebRTC to build real-time communication into your web apps:\n\nwhat are MediaStream, PeerConnection and DataChannel?\nhow does WebRTC signalling work?\nwhat are ICE, TURN and STUN?\nwhat do I need server-side for WebRTC?\n\nFor reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
