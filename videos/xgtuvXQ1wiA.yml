description: "DOES19 Las Vegas — Toyota has been a part of the cultural fabric in the U.S. and North America for more than 60 years, and is committed to advancing sustainable, next-generation mobility through the Toyota brand. In support of this commitment Toyota must maintain many systems both legacy and new, all while navigating a multitude of agile environments such as waterfall, SCRUM and Kanban. So how did Toyota bring such a large multi-dimensional ecosystem onto a standard enterprise platform? In this session attendees will learn how Toyota implemented DevOps and Release Orchestration across multiple tech stacks and public clouds like AWS and Azure to achieve high SLAs. Attendees will journey through the challenges, innovation, regulatory compliance and change management including how XebiaLabs helped implement Ji Kotei Kanketsu (JKK), Toyota’s internal process for developing, maintaining and improving processes to produce the best outputs.\n\nDOES19 Las Vegas\nDOES 2019 US\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
