Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nIntro: Flux - Stefan Prodan, Weaveworks & Alexis Richardson, Weaveworks \n\nIn this session, we will introduce the basics of Flux and its Helm Operator sub-project. Flux is an open source operator that makes GitOps happen in your cluster. It automatically ensures that the state of your Kubernetes cluster matches the configuration youâ€™ve supplied in Git. We will explore the GitOps methodology and talk about the benefits of using Flux to do Kubernetes cluster management and application delivery. We shall compare Flux with other approaches like Spinnaker and talk about the differences between CiOps and GitOps. Flux joined CNCF in August 2019 as a sandbox project. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Uai2"
