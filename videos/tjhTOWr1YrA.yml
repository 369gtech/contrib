title: 'HTML5 Testing in All Browsers with Java'
recordingDate: 1370454389
description: "The biggest challenge in writing HTML5 applications is that your application must run on many platforms, ranging from old desktop browsers to cutting-edge mobile browsers. Each browser behaves nearly the same, but inconsistencies can lead to major bugs.\n\nKevin Nilson, hardcore developer and VP of Engineering at just.me, shows you how to leverage several open source Java tools to test your HTML5 apps in ALL browsers, including:\n\n- TestSwarm\n- QUnit\n- jQuery\n- Jenkins/Hudson\n- Oracle VM VirtualBox\n- GlassFish\n- Sun SPOTs\n\n** We'll be publishing more videos from JAXConf 2013 at http://mrkn.co/jaxconf"
