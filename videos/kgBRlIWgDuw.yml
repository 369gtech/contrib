description: 'Java 9 is out and it is more than just the module system (yes, I was surprised, too). In this talk you''ll learn about nifty new language features, new APIs like stack walking and collection factory methods, the additions to existing APIs, like `Stream`, `Optional`, the Process API, and other niceties like multi-release JARs and performance improvements. The elephant in the room, Jigsaw, will also get its five minutes in the spotlight. After this talk you will be prepared to finally get started with Java 9''s new features.'
