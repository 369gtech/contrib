description: "PyTorch is a popular deep learning library released by Facebook's AI Research lab. In this video, I'll explain some of its unique features, then use it to solve the Kaggle \"Invasive Species Monitoring Challenge\". Sometimes, certain species of plants can slowly destroy an ecosystem if left unchecked. We're going to build a ResNet classifier using PyTorch to help detect which plants need to be removed to help the larger ecosystem survive. Get hype!
