description: "Learn how to create an Android app with Kotlin that uses core UI components from the Robinhood stock trading app. Instead of tracking stocks, this app will track COVID-19 cases. The app displays key metrics around the growth of coronavirus, including the number of positive cases, negative cases, and deaths per day.\n\nWe use data from The COVID Tracking Project (https://covidtracking.com/api).\n\nüíª Code: https://github.com/rpandey1234/Covid19Tracker. \n\nüîó Follow Rahul on Twitter: https://twitter.com/rpandey1234\nüîó Follow Rahul on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/rpandey1234\n\nIf you're encountering an issue with views not being resolved in the Kotlin file, you should get a reference to the view with findViewById at the top of MainActivity.
