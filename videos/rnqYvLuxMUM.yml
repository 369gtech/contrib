description: "As Chief Product Officer, Sharren Bates is responsible for the vision, strategy, design and development of inBloom products and services.\n\nPrior to joining inBloom in February 2013, Sharren's excitement about the power of personalized learning and deep understanding of barriers to entry and innovation in the sector led her to her previous role as Senior Program Officer on the Next Generation Models team at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. There she was one of the Foundation's lead representatives on the Shared Learning Collaborative, and spearheaded the development of the inBloom technology services.\n\nPrior to the Gates Foundation, Sharren worked on education policy at the federal level as an education analyst working on the National Broadband Plan at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Previously, she led the New York City Department of Education's Achievement Reporting and Innovation System (ARIS) team, launching an integrated data reporting and collaboration system for the city's 90,000 teachers and approximately 800,000 parents.\n\nSharren has been working at the intersection of education policy, classroom practice, and technology for the past eight years, and draws on fifteen years cross-industry experience delivering high-quality large-scale technology projects on time and on budget. She lives in Bucks County PA with her husband."
