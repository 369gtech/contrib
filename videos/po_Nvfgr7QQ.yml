title: '[LIGHTNING TALK] Anna Doubková - Going Native: Reusing Code'
recordingDate: 1536932494
description: 'React Native allows you to re-use your React code to build native applications. What’s not to like? This approach is simple in theory but challenging in practice. In this talk, you’ll learn how to go truly cross-platform, how to transform web applications into native applications and vice versa. Which parts can be used both in web and native, and which ones can''t - and why? What are the intricacies of shared code bases and how do we handle cross-team communication when building web and native apps at the same time? With real-life examples, code snippets, and memes, you will learn everything you need to know to get started on your native journey.'
