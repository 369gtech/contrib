description: "I'd love to talk about what it's like to build an early stage product with an outsourced team, both the pros and cons. First with a team in China, then in the Ukraine with a CTO here, then solely with a team in the Ukraine + NYC. Learnings that can be applied to teams big and small, especially in the early stages of a product. \n\ntwitter.com/founderofstick\ngithub.com/allimckee"
