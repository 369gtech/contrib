description: "How to Apply GitOps on Infrastructure (for Real)\n\nViktor Farcic, Shipa\n\nWhen managing infrastructure today, we have a few requirements beyond the obvious ones, such as defining everything as code.\n\n- It should be based on GitOps principles\n- It should detect drifts automatically and converge the actual (infra) into the desired (Git) state automatically\n- It should be based on a common API, potentially the same one we are using for managing other states (e.g., applications)\n\nIn this session, we will explore Crossplane combined with Argo CD as a potential solution for all our infrastructure needs and see whether it fits into the broader Kubernetes ecosystem.\n\nView the full LISA21 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa21/program"
