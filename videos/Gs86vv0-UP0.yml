description: "Have you ever worked on a computer system that was so fragile it was frightening to make changes to? Maybe it was challenging to deploy, difficult to delete code, or changing one piece would cause surprising cascading failures.\n\nThis talk will focus on ways our tools, systems design, and processes can enable a team to do high velocity, confident work, and yes, reduce the fear of the computer."
