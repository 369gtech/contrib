description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM V 2020 - https://codesync.global/conferences/code-beam-sto/\n\nMore great virtual tech conferences - https://codesync.global \n\n---\n\nE2E backend testing with Ecto API by \nNikola Begedin \n\nABSTRACT\nHound and Wallaby are great test tools. We get access to the Ecto sandbox out of the box, so the background for each test is easy to set up.\nHowever, both are quite difficult to operate any anything other than a simple frontend, which is part of the Phoenix app itself.\nWhat most people do not know is that Ecto supports Sandbox access via API endpoints, making it possible to use any test runner, such as Cypress or Testcafe, paired with any frontend of any complexity.\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - Nikola Begedin \nNikola started off as a .NET developer, then moved on to frontend when Knockout.js was all the hype. Unsatisfied with local employment, Nikola started freelancing. He was soon hired by a US company, where he learned full stack in Ruby and Ember, eventually moving on to Elixir and React, now on Elixir and Vue...\n\n---\n\nCode BEAM V 2020 was sponsored by Duffel, PepsiCo, Klarna, WhatsApp, DNSimple, Flyiin, Erlang Solutions, Forza Football, BlockFi, App Unite, Pleroma, Simplabs, Telnyx, Clever Bunny, O'Reilly, Manning Publications\n\nCode BEAM V\nWebsite: https://codesync.global/conferences/c...\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/CodeBEAMio"
