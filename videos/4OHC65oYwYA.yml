description: "The road to zen winds through self-monitoring applications, which can reduce the time and effort in diagnosing and correcting production issues. In this talk, we will see how modern Windows applications can self-monitor, self-diagnose, and potentially self-recover without needing an external monitoring agent or a brute-force restarting watchdog. By harnessing the power of ETW for low-level accurate monitoring, Windows performance counters for zero-overhead statistics, and the CLRMD library for inspecting your own threads, heap objects, and locks, you can take your applications one step closer to self-awareness. This will be illustrated through a series of demos: automatic CPU profiling and pinpointing the busy threads and stacks; automatic GC monitoring, including object allocations; automatic heap analysis to reveal unraveling memory leaks; and more. At the end of the talk, you will be equipped with tools and techniques for implementing self-monitoring in your own applications.\n\nKey takeaways\nYou will learn how to build applications that monitor their own resource consumption\nYou will learn how to inspect your application’s internal data structures and threads\nYou will learn how to automatically triage application issues in the field\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
