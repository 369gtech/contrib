recordingDate: 1510303650
description: "More and more companies and organizations are working with (globally) distributed software engineers. Though there are clear and promising benefits (access to talent, close to customers, lower salary costs and time advantages), distributed working also provides many challenges in practice. In this talk, Rini van Solingen (professor in global software engineering at Delft University of Technology) shares his condensed findings and conclusions from the past years. He summarizes them in 9 'goods', 'bads' and 'uglies', and will support these with practical cases as well as theoretical findings.\n\nRini van Solingen (prof.dr.) is a part-time full professor in Global Software Engineering at the Delft University of Technology, where he heads the research and education regarding worldwide-distributed software teams. Additionally, Rini is the CTO of Prowareness (www.scrum.nl). There he helps organizations work nimbly and deliver high-value software products. The leadership of large scale Agile transformations and implementing Agile with tens or hundreds of teams is his specialty. In that arena, he trains and supports (management) teams. Rini is author of several books of which “The Power of Scrum” , \"Scrum for Managers\" and \"How to lead self-managing teams\" are most well-known."
