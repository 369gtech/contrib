language: English
recordingDate: 1620635199
description: "We have to admit that web technologies conquered the world. JavaScript development is not about building web-applications anymore: JavaScript can be used for building native mobile and desktop applications as well. It brings bigger responsibilities to front-end engineers to make sure that our applications are secure. Do you think that building a static website will solve all your security problems? In the following session we will talk about modern front-end security landscape: tools and techniques used by “bad guys” to compromise your applications, why web frameworks usage is not a “silver bullet” and how you can fight back and mitigate security risks.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks at: \nhttps://ndcsydney.com\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/"
