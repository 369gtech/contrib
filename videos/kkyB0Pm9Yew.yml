title: 'Browser Fingerprinting: Stalking With a Personal Touch - Eivind Arvesen - NDC Oslo 2020'
recordingDate: 1602541855
description: "Internet users are constantly identified and tracked across the web, for purposes such as targeted advertising, gaining personal data, or analytics. This happens without their knowledge or consent, and only relies on standard Web APIs. While disabling cookies and JavaScript would solve most of these issues, it would also break most modern websites.\nThis talk will introduce browser fingerprinting, why it is a problem, how fingerprinting is performed, some misuse-cases (as well as use-cases), a few defense mechanisms and attempted solutions."
