description: "Anders Wallgren, CTO, Electric Cloud\n\nTight coupling and interdependence between dev teams slows down development, and environment drift causes deployment problems when promoting applications between environments. The introduction of the microservices architecture expands on the role of SOA by allowing for the looser coupling of endpoints and environments, allowing more predictability, flexibility and agility.\n\nHowever, microservices come with their own set of problems:\n• Many distributed and small repos\n• Many more pieces to work with\n• Complex run-time dependency management\n\nThis talk will discuss modern requirements for creating, deploying and managing multiple microservices both independently and as a collection in order to satisfy end user requirements and allow for continuous delivery."
