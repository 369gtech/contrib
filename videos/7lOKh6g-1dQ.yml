description: "Connected applications only work when connected. What happens if the network breaks temporarily? Will your system recover smoothly or pitch a fit? Using an OSS project called Polly (available on GitHub) you can handle this and many other transient situations with elegance and fluency.\n\nPolly letâ€™s you define retry policies using standard patterns such as retry, retry forever, wait and retry, and circuit breaker. Learn how to make your system bulletproof with Polly and a little know-how.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndcminnesota.com/"
