description: "Marc Andreessen famously said “software is eating the world”, yet most of our teams and organisations simply aren’t set up to allow us to take part in the revolution because our surroundings are directly responsible for inefficient design and delivery – silos, project-based-funding, multi-layered middle management, command-and-control execs – the failings are well known. I know how incredibly frustrating this is, when all you want to do is ship great product.\n\nMy colleagues and I at ThoughtWorks are frequently tasked with fixing these org and cultural problems. We have a wealth of experience in confronting and challenging them head on and I want to share it.\n\nThis session will give you the low down on tried and tested ways to fix such issues, empowering you to drive incremental change yourself, from the bottom up. Change that includes both free-and-easy fast-moving (dev) culture hacks, and safe (step by step, supported by tests) org-refactorings. Change that responds to the specifics of your organisation and focusses on efficient delivery of software. And change that take its inspiration from the software techniques which we know so well."
