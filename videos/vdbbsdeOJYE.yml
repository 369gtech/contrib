This presentation will give you information about the Foundation, and the most important projects you should know for your software tooling or your projects. In particular, it will introduce the OSGi project and how it has been used to provide the powerful Eclipse 4 architecture (RCP). Then I will explain you how the Eclipse Modeling project can help to build your productivity tooling. Namely how you can create meta-models, editors for your models and code generators very easily using the EMF, XText, Xtend and Sirius projects.\n\nSo if you are a standalone application developper or a web developper you will discover powerful projects that will help you every day for your future developments.\n\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/Eclipse-Singapore/events/237370395/\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/4adQ/"
