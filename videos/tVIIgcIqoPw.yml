description: 'In this session, we build and deploy a simple App Engine application using unauthenticated and authenticated (OAuth2) calls to Google APIs (eg. Google+ API).  We also demonstrate use of Google Plugin for Eclipse (GPE), Maven, Mercurial, client libraries and App Engine SDK tools that make application development easier.  This session demonstrated by Sachin Kotwani is in Java and you can find the equivalent Python version at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVjZMIWhz3Y by Prashant Labhane.  You can find more references about Google Cloud development at developers.google.com and cloud.google.com.'
