description: "Many program installers request users to download and execute an installation script. These scripts often run with elevated privileges and a user's only defense against a malicious script is to manually audit the code. However, we can automate the verification process for the user by embedding installation scripts in a secure programming language and distributing a trusted client that downloads and interprets scripts written in this secure language. This language must walk a fine line: it must be sufficiently powerful to embed useful installation scripts, but sufficiently restrictive to forbid remote code from damaging the user's system. This talk introduces a proof-of-concept implementation of this secure installer.\n\nhttp://forwardjs.com/\n\nTraining & Resources for Professional Web Development Teams: \nhttps://newcircle.com"
