description: "Immutability for Cloud Foundry: Security in a Cloud Native World - Nolan Karpinski, Immutable Systems\n\nIn a cloud native environment, with applications that are abstracted from infrastructure such as Cloud Foundry based apps, there is an opportunity to reconsider the fundamental approach to security.\n\nBracket Computing has been working closely with the Cloud Foundry community to create new tools to harden a CF foundation and make it truly immutable. A truly immutable infrastructure will include controls to assure that stemcells cannot be modified even with the highest levels of privilege. This means that even with root access, a truly immutable infrastructure will resist the attack.\n\nBracket has developed a unique architecture that applies security and immutability controls via a virtualization layer called the Metavisor that wraps every stemcell. Enforcing immutability with Metavisor means that the controls cannot be bypassed even if an attacker gains root access to the stemcell VM.\n\nThis talk will focus on five areas required to achieve infrastructure immutability for CF:\n\n1. Kernel immutability. Critical parts of the kernel such as the system call table should be protected.\n2. File immutability. All file changes should be tracked and authorized.\n3. Privilege immutability. Privilege changes should be monitored and/or disallowed.\n4. Process immutability. Certain processes, for example a web server, should never spawn shells or execute unknown code.\n5. Network immutability. Allowed ports and protocols should be static at runtime. \n\nAbout Nolan Karpinski\nNolan Karpinski is a Product Manager at Immutable Systems, focusing on server immutability. He is responsible for bringing Immutable Systems's Server Guard product to market. Immutable Systems was founded with a big goal: To deliver enterprise grade security controls without impacting the speed and agility of the self-service cloud. Prior to Immutable Sytems, Nolan worked on the Advanced Malware Protection team at Cisco. Nolan has an engineering degree from Tufts University."
