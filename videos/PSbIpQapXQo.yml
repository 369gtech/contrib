title: 'Lambda Days 2015 - Rafa≈Ç Studnicki - Is it possible to run Erlang on 32 kilobytes of RAM?'
recordingDate: 1429196583
description: "MSc of Computer Science.\nCurrently working as an Erlang Developer at Erlang Solutions Ltd, he is a valued member of the MongooseIM development team.\nHis expertise includes XMPP based services and servers (MongooseIM and ejabberd), different testing tools, as well as SQL and NoSQL databases.\nLikes to look under the hood.\n\nIs it possible to run Erlang on 32 kilobytes of RAM?\n\nSome people think of Erlang as a language of choice for programming embedded devices.\n\nThis assumption might stem from how the language originated or from the recent attempts to reduce the learning curve for embedded programming.\n\nIn this talk I'd like to report on the progress made trying to fit as many Erlang Virtual Machine elements as possible on a microcontroller containing merely 32 kilobytes of RAM.\nThe goal is to explore the ramifications that need to be taken into consideration when using such a high-level language on such a device."
