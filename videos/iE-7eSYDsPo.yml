title: 'Next Level Spring Boot Tooling by Martin Lippert'
language: English
recordingDate: 1492601574
description: "The recent releases of the widely used Spring tooling for Eclipse have focused a lot on making Spring Boot app and microservice development easier and more effective. In this talk we will showcase the latest features for working with Spring Boot - using live demos and live coding. We will show the easiest ways to get started with Spring Boot, move on to advanced features for dealing with Spring Boot properties in property and YAML files (including greatly improved content-assist, validations, hover help), and demo the Spring Boot dashboard. This major innovation in the Spring tooling makes it extremely easy to deal with potentially many Spring Boot microservice projects in your workspace. We will demo all the new features, including advanced editing of Cloud Foundry manifest files and the ability to detect and merge configuration changes between your cloud runtime and your workspace projects. The talk is all about being more effective in your IDE when working with Spring Boot and turning your IDE into a microservice development center when working with Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, and a cloud-native runtime like Cloud Foundry.\n\nMartin works at Pivotal on Eclipse-based developer tooling for the Spring framework, Spring Boot, and Cloud Foundry. He co-leads the team that ships the famous Spring IDE and the Spring Tool Suite, the Cloud Foundry Integration for Eclipse, AJDT, AspectJ, and is researching and implementing future cloud-based developer tooling. He is project co-lead of the Eclipse Flux project. Martin is also co-founder of it-agile GmbH, one of the leading agile companies in Germany."
