language: English
recordingDate: 1494276362
description: 'We all know how healthy kale is, but a diet of only kale would leave us nutritionally imbalanced. (And grumpy.) Likewise, containers are a great innovation for IT, but only one part of the successful organization''s IT "food pyramid." In this session, we''ll talk about the role of containers as part of a larger digital transformation, and how we build on and integrate Linux containers as part of a successful solution. In this session you''ll not only gain insight into Linux containers, but also how the standards allow us to build larger solutions that we can depend on to deliver applications faster, more reliably, and with greater flexibility for the business.'
