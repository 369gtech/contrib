recordingDate: 1567601185
description: "Technology has changed so much about our culture in just the past 10 years, and the world of sales & marketing hasn’t been immune.  There’s never been a larger shift in how we market, sell and buy. Where marketing is concerned, consumers have become experts at tuning out all but the most unique marketing efforts. Sales has shifted dramatically as well, as buyers skip the human element in favor of buying online whenever possible. \n\n•    There’s no doubt that technology has changed consumer behavior. \n•    How consumers behave changes how companies respond with their sales and marketing efforts. \n•    Therefore, technology, in essence, is responsible for these massive shifts in sales and marketing in recent years.\n\nWhat does the future hold? As buyers take more control of the buying process, and technology continues to enable them, does this spell the death of sales and marketing? In short, YES…the death of sales & marketing as they currently exist.\n\nOUTCOMES:\n\n•    Discover how technology will continue to drive change in buyer behavior, and what that will mean for marketers and salespeople.\n•    Learn how businesses can adapt to stay relevant, rather than be reactive and face decline.  \n•    Walk away with new ideas for disrupting the future and capturing marketshare from those who refuse to adapt.\n\nThe speech took place on 9th May 2019 on Inspire Stage during Infoshare 2019."
