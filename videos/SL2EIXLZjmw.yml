description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nIntro: Brigade - Radu Matei & Kent Rancourt, Microsoft \n\nBrigade is a lightweight, Kubernetes-native framework which allows the creation of event-driven workflows. Using JavaScript, Brigade chains together containers and controls their execution in an in-cluster scripting environment that enables easy error handling and data sharing. In this session, you will learn how to get started with Brigade, how to use the existing GitHub, CloudEvents and generic event support and integrate them in your workflow, and how different companies are using Brigade to automate their internal workflows (from code quality assessment and security scanning, to automatically generating preview environments for each pull request), and ultimately allow teams to build massively distributed workflows using a few lines of JavaScript. Finally, we will explore future plans and share the progress for the next major version of Brigade, 2.0.\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zeuq"
