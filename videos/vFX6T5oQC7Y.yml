recordingDate: 1395768835
description: "Making the transition from a development and/or test deployment of Datomic to a production deployment can be a daunting task for the uninitiated. This presentation will provide an overview of RoomKey.com's Datomic deployment, the evolution there-of, real world examples of deployment methodology to the audience, and the pitfalls Room Key stumbled upon during the course of operating Datomic in a production environment.\n\nReal world examples of CloudFormation templates will be shared, along with examples of how to perform transactor and peer upgrades with minimal database downtime.\n\nIn addition to Datomic, Amazon Web Services will be at the heart of the discussion, so familiarity with AWS will be helpful to audience members."
