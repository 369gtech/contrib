title: 'Making Sense of Streaming Sensor Data: How Uber Detects On-trip Car Crashes - N. Anderson & J. Yang'
recordingDate: 1571153429
description: 'Safety is one of the most crucial concerns of Uberâ€™s ride-sharing platform. To advance the timeliness in response to the safety issues in daily business, Uber runs a Flink pipeline that joins together multiple high volume (less then 10 TB/day) streaming sources of sensor data along with trip information in order to extract a number of contextual features. It deploys a deep learning model on top of TensorFlow in Flink to detect potential car crashes and identify general trip and driving anomalies. This knowledge is then passed down to the business operational teams to proactively reach out to riders and drivers to confirm their user experiences and provide prompt safety assistance if needed.'
