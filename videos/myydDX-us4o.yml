description: "I've built a cryptocurrency trading bot called GradientTrader, and in this video I'll show you the tools I used to build it! It uses a graphical interface that lets you back-test on historical data, simulate paper trading, and implement a custom trading strategy for the real markets. The technique I used was a cutting edge Deep Reinforcement Learning strategy called Multi Agent Actor Critic. I'll explain it all here, enjoy! \n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/Watch-Me-Build-a-Trading-Bot\n\nPlease Subscribe! And like. And comment.
