description: "A lightning talk presented by Andy Burke at JSLA October 25th, 2012\nThis talk is about my use of Twitter Bootstrap, Flatiron's director.js and LinkedIn's version of Dust tempting to create grmble.com. It's a pretty lightweight way to get something up and I arrived at it after 1) rolling my own, 2) looking at frameworks after it got unmanageable and 3) trying to rewrite using Backbone but finding it to be way too over-the-top."
