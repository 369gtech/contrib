It is a new normal*. With every new device, service or app a promise of fulfillment of our needs and ultimate adaptability is sold to us. What is hidden from our sight is the real purpose of the flawless software and shiny gadgets; they extort data, fight for our attention and play on individual and collective vulnerabilities. Personal security, psychological health, equal opportunities, social tissue, democracy - all those concepts can be destroyed by reckless use of technology or preserved and cherished by it. How to introduce values in the process of development of new technologies? How to make it truly humane and make sure it serves good purposes? Karolina Iwańska, a lawyer from Panoptykon Foundation and Kamil Grondys, a senior solutions architect from Samsung Electronics will present you an overview of the main ideas on the macro (EU regulation) and micro (programming team) scale.  \n\n---\n\nSPEAKERS\nKarolina Iwańska\nPanoptykon Foundation & Mozilla Fellow \nKarolina is a lawyer at Panoptykon Foundation, a Warsaw-based NGO fighting for human rights in the age of surveillance and member of the European Digital Rights Initiative.
