She is trying to create design probes and tools for deliberation and public participation in science. She follows and supports science community labs and alternative R&D places (Hackerspaces, FabLabs) across the world with a special focus on DIYbio movements, consumer genomics and various citizen science projects. The ethnographic research of these participative and design oriented forms of R&D is combined with genealogical interest in the origins of tinkering culture in the 16. century mechanical arts, early visions of Academy of sciences and discussions between science and alchemy.\nCurrent design projects focused on food and the use of critical probes to reflect upon issues in food studies: Secret Cooks Club www.secretcooks.org and FoodMatch www.foodmatch.org.\nPrevious design project (2008 â€“ 2010): real time video & heritage (Living Avatars Network: outsourcing experiences in real time), real time video as ethnographic methodology.\nTeaching and Research interests in Interactive Media Design, Science and Technology Studies and topics in Digital Culture and Art.\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/WCjv/"
