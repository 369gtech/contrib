Past recipients have included Brian Aker, Angela Byron, Karl Fogel, Pamela Jones, Bruce Momjian, Rikki Endsley, Chris Messina, Sarah Sharp, David Recordon, VM Brasseur, Andrew Tridgell, and Doug Cutting. The nomination process was open to the entire open source community, and all entries were judged by previous winners. The winners will be announced during keynotes on Thursday, May 11.\n\n\nThe Frank Willison Memorial Award for Contributions to the Python Community is given annually to one or two people judged to have made an outstanding contribution to the Python community. The award was established in memory of Frank Willison, a Python enthusiast and O’Reilly editor-in-chief, who died in July 2001. Tim O’Reilly’s “In Memory of Frank Willison” includes a collection of quotes from Frank’s insightful and witty writing, and O’Reilly Media maintains an online archive of Frank Willison’s column, Frankly Speaking.\n\nSubscribe to O'Reilly on YouTube: http://goo.gl/n3QSYi\n\nFollow O'Reilly on \nTwitter: http://twitter.com/oreillymedia\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/OReilly\nGoogle: http://plus.google.com/+oreillymedia"
