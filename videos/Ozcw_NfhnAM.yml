title: 'The world has changed, but school hasn''t'
recordingDate: 1548358646
description: "Lana Brindley, Tahlia White\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/253/\n\nThe world has moved on significantly from the Victorian era, when 'school' as we now know it was first invented. And while the funding models and teaching methods have changed somewhat over the past couple of hundred years, what children do in school has, in reality, changed very little. \r\n\r\nLana will take you through a brief history of public schooling in Australia, focussing on the relative openness of each major step along the way, while Tahlia will recount stories of her own experiences as a student in the present-day public school system.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/\n\n#linux.conf.au #linux #foss #opensource"
