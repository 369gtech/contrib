description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nTutorial: KubeEdge Hands on Workshop -- Build Your Edge AI App on Real Edge Devices - Zefeng Wang, Huawei & Zhang Jie, China Unicom \n\nHere a hands-on KubeEdge workshop is proposed which ideally will run through the full length of the conference.  This workshop is intend to invite participants to get hands on experience building a real edge computing solution with KubeEdge, end-to-end.  Starting from deploying and provisioning an edge node(e.g. raspberry Pi), followed with device modeling and connectivity setup, then building a video stream machine learning based solution.  Through this exercise, participants will get first hand experience to understand the orchestration engine build on top of kurbenetes, understand the edge computing node setup mechanism, learn the device modeling concept for IoT Edge scenarios. And develop a state-of-art AI based video stream processing flow, all in a 30 minutes session.\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zep5"
