description: "When people talk about advantages of micro-services, easy scaling and resilience come up frequently. What they don’t usually tell you, is that robustness does not come for free. If you don’t put extra effort into gracefully failing when one of your dependencies is down, microservices will only make your system even more brittle.\nI will tell you the story of how we learned to build resilient micro-services even if they depend on other micro-services with a weaker SLA. It was probably the most crucial part of our journey from an unreliable monolith to a robust set of microservices. First I’ll talk about the bad practices to set the stage for the motivation behind the good practices, finally, I introduce a number of useful patterns."
