title: '"New" Features in C - Dan Saks'
recordingDate: 1569225223
description: "The first international standard for the C programming language was C90. Since then, three newer standards have been published: C99, C11, and C18. C99 introduced a significant number of new features. C11 introduced a few more, many of which have been available in compilers for some time. C18 fixed bugs in C11 but introduced no new features. Curiously, many of these added features donâ€™t seem to have caught on. Too many C programmers still program in C90 with a sprinkling of C99.\n\nThis session explains many of these \"new\" C features, including inline functions, complex arithmetic, extended integer types, variable-length arrays, flexible array members, compound literals, designated initializers, restricted pointers, type-qualified array parameters, anonymous structures and unions, alignment support, non-returning functions, and static assertions.\n\nSave the date for NDC TechTown 2020  (31st of August - 3rd of September)\n\nCheck out more of our talks at: \nhttps://ndctechtown.com/\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/"
