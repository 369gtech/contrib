description: "Are you ready for a game-changer? Can you do physics at 60 frames per second controlling DOM on a mobile device? Steve Newcomb, founder and CEO of famo.us, is here to tell you yes, yes you can.\n\nIn this highly anticipated and applauded presentation from HTML5 Dev Conf 4, Steve walks us through building a highly performant 3D physics engine in JavaScript. Full of demos that will challenge your faith in CSS3, and an announcement that the famo.us platform will be free for developers deploying apps, this presentation is just about the coolest thing we've seen in a while.\n\n** Head to http://mrkn.co/w49bn for Steve's slides, and to http://mrkn.co/3kg1q for his presentation on the famo.us render engine"
