description: 'Independent of the source of data, the integration of event streams into an Enterprise Architecture gets more and more important in the world of sensors, social media streams and Internet of Things. Events have to be accepted quickly and reliably, they have to be distributed and analysed, often with many consumers or systems interested in all or part of the events. How can we make sure that all these events are accepted and forwarded in an efficient and reliable way? This is where Apache Kafaka comes into play, a distirbuted, highly-scalable messaging broker, build for exchanging huge amounts of messages between a source and a target. This session will start with an introduction of Apache and presents the role of Apache Kafka in a modern data / information architecture and the advantages it brings to the table.'
