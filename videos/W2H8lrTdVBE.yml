description: "Frictionless Data is a suite of open source software, tools, and specifications, with our main reference code in Python, that aims to reduce “frictions” in working with data so users can progress from data to insight faster. Over the past year and a half, we have been working specifically with the researcher community to prototype using Frictionless Data’s open source tools to improve researchers’ data workflows and champion open science. This talk will discuss the technical ideas behind Frictionless Data by showcasing a recent collaborative use case with oceanographers. Together, we implemented Frictionless Data Python code into their data ingest pipelines to integrate disparate data while maintaining quality metadata in an easy to use interface.\n\nThis talk will discuss the technical ideas behind Frictionless Data by showcasing a recent collaborative use case with oceanographers.

PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
