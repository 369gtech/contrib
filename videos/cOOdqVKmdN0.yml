description: "Speaker: Jon Chan (jonhmchan), Lead, Marketing Engineering @ Stack Overflow\n\nAt Stack Overflow, we are a remote-first company. That means no matter where you are in the world, if you are a great developer, we want to make sure you’re treated just like you’re in our headquarters in New York. How do you build agile teams when most people are remote? We take this to an extreme: get my first-hand account of what it’s like to work full-time as an engineer at Stack Overflow traveling to 22 cities in 7 countries in three months. You’ll learn what it means to build a truly remote culture, what tools we use to make it possible, and how we do standups, iteration, and communication in a truly international engineering team.\n\nAbout the speaker\n\nJon is a developer at Stack Overflow since 2013 and heads up Marketing Engineering and Developer Evangelism there. He is also the founder of Bento, a site that helps hundreds of thousands of self-taught developers around the world learn to code from the best resources. Jon speaks frequently on tech education, diversity, and how to build engineering focused startups. Before Stack Overflow and Bento, Jon was a technology consultant at Deloitte and graduated from New York University.\n\nSlides: https://speakerdeck.com/player/eb613ccc851a4706a17bdf284b5c03c5?feature=oembed\n\nEvent Page: http://2016.agilesingapore.org\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/XvSs/"
