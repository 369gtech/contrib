description: "When you look for inspiration in the Agile Coaching community, the name Gordon Ramsay is probably not the first name to come to mind. He has been known to be belligerent, condescending and downright rude, but underneath this brute facade is a treasure trove of skills and talents that influence change.\nIn this presentation we will draw insights from his ‘Kitchen Nightmare’ escapades and draw parallels with how much his work aligns with that of an Agile Coach and the goal to successfully drive change and introduce a number of models and techniques that are indispensable in the coaching toolkit.\n\nCraig Smith has been an Agile Practitioner, Coach and one of Australia’s premier Agile Trainers for over ten years. As a technical director at YOW!, co-organiser of the Agile Brisbane Meetup Group, advisor of Agile Australia, co-chair of one of the world’s leading Agile Podcasts and an Agile Editor for InfoQ, Craig is one of Australia’s heaviest contributors to the Agile community. Craig has presented at numerous conferences including Agile 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2013. He has also presented at Agile Australia from 2009-2016, as well as numerous other Agile conferences and meetups. Craig specialises in all facets of Agile training, executive coaching and technical excellence by helping teams move quality to the left.\n\nFor more information on YOW!
