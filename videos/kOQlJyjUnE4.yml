Considering other phases is necessary, because there is ample evidence that the programs end users create are filled with errors. To help address this problem, we have been working on an approach to software engineering for end users. It incorporates support for software engineering devices to help end- user programmers with, for example, systematic testing and fault localization. The catch: the user is not assumed to have expertise or even interest in software engineering. In this talk, I will..."
