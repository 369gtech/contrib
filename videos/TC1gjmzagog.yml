description: "MobileOptimized 2020, Online â€“ November 6-7, 2020\n\nTypeScript for the Swift Developer, Orta Therox\n\nJavaScript is the world's most popular language, and TypeScript is increasingly how people write JavaScript. \n\nNative developers can try, but you cannot escape the gravity well of the JavaScript ecosystem - so at least they can understand some of the mechanics behind how the 2nd most loved programming language on a Stack Overflow survey works.\n\nThis talk comes from a long-time (more than 10 years) Mac and iOS developer who now works on the TypeScript compiler team at Microsoft."
