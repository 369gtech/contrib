description: 'The Java 8 Streams library makes it easy to run code in parallel. A common error is code that works when run sequentially but that misbehaves when run in parallel. This is often caused by programmers who are stuck in a mode of imperative, left-to-right thinking. This leads to an iterative style in which data is mutated and where the next result depends on the result of the previous computation, creating barriers to parallel computation. This presentation covers an alternative programming technique called array programming, where operations are applied on data aggregates instead of individual elements. It also includes examples and demonstrations that illustrate these techniques and how they lead to easier-to-understand, parallel-ready code.'
