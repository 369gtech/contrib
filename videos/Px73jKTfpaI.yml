description: "Have your cake and eat it – an introduction to event-driven architecture\n\nEvery day we lose data. Not by accident or disaster, but by implementation. However, unlike cake, we can keep our data as we consume and act upon it. This talk is an introduction to event-driven architecture. We’ll learn how to implement event sourcing; revealing intent, decoupling our microservices and even allowing us to time-travel and change history when fixing bugs. We’ll be simultaneously making our lives easier as developers whilst better supporting the growth of our businesses – it doesn’t get much better than that, does it?"
