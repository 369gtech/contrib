description: "Google Tech Talk\r\nWeb Exponents\r\nPresented by Peter-Paul Koch\r\nApril 24, 2009\r\n\r\nblog post: http://google-code-updates.blogspot.com/2009/04/ppk-open-web-goes-mobile.html\r\n\r\nIn this session PPK will discuss some aspects of mobile browser compatibility as well as W3C Widgets, which promise to be the first open, universal standard for creating small and large applications on mobile phone.\r\n\r\nPeter-Paul Koch is a freelance front-end consultant, agent, and trainer in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. He has won international renown with his browser compatibility research, frequently speaks at conferences, has founded Fronteers, the Dutch association of front-end professionals, and advises browser vendors on their implementation of the web standards.\r\n\r\nOn the Web he is universally known as ppk.\r\n\r\nHe feels like Caesar when he talks about himself in the third person, but he will not conquer Gaul. More importantly, he will not write his memoirs in Latin."
