description: 'Functional Programming promotes immutability and the use of higher order functions. For those of us who have designed and architected applications using imperative style of programming and the object-oriented paradigm, this largely appears like a strange idea. We often ask, how is it practical to apply these ideas, realistically to build practical applications. It turns out itâ€™s highly practical but we have to change how we design and how we model our systems. Come to this presentation to think about functional style and how to start viewing design to make better use of this way of programming.'
