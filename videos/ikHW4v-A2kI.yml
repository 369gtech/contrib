description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nInnerSource 和 DevOps：灵魂伴侣 | InnerSource & DevOps: They Are Soul Mates - Jerry Tan, OpenAtom Foundation\n\nInnerSource 是利用开源软件开发的最佳实践，并在组织内部建立类似开源的文化。DevOps 是一套将软件开发 (Dev) 和信息技术操作 (Ops) 结合起来的实践。其旨在缩短系统开发生命周期，确保持续交付高软件质量。之所以说这两者是灵魂伴侣，是因为他们有着相同的目标，即提高效率，并且他们遵循着相同的核心价值观，即开放/透明/协作。此外，它们互相帮助，DevOps 可以帮助 InnerSource，InnerSource 也可以帮助 DevOps。我将在演讲中详细讨论这两者间的关系。\n\nInnerSource is the use of Open Source Software development best practices and the establishment of an open source like culture within an organization. DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development(Dev) and IT operations(Ops). It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality. They are soul mates because they have the same objective ---to improve efficiency，and they follow the same core values --0pen/Transparent/Collaboration。 And they help each other, DevOps can help InnerSource, and InnerSource can help DevOps also. I will discuss their relationships in my talk in detail."
