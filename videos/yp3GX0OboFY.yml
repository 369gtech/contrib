description: "Distributed Teams and Successful Remote Engineering\n\nDavid Argent, Amazon\n\nSince early 2020 work environments around the world have changed dramatically. People who had never before considered working from home have found themselves in that situation. Transitioning to a workforce which has a large presence working remotely is a challenge for both individuals and organisations. Avleen is a WFH veteran having spent nearly 10 years practicing it as an IC and building successful remote teams. He will present lessons for individuals, leaders and groups on how to make a successful transition to working from home, and how to make it viable for the long term.\n\nAvleen is a Production Engineer at Facebook, where he helps scale Facebookâ€™s infrastructure. Before joining Facebook he worked at several large tech companies, including EarthLink, Google, and Etsy."
