description: 'Reliability, security, cost optimization, operational excellence and performance efficiency—not easy to tackle when it comes to your cloud workloads. This is where the Azure Well-Architected Framework comes into the picture. In this event we are going to take you behind the scenes at Azure where you will get five brief peeks at how we power the features that address each of these pillars of the Azure Well-Architected Framework. Not only will you learn how things work behind the curtain, but you’ll also take away some tips and tricks you won’t find anywhere else to help with these subjects. This two hour live event on LearnTV will bring you five sessions, each with an opportunity to get your questions answered directly from our speakers. Join us!'
