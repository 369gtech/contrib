title: '"The ZFS filesystem" - Philip Paeps (LCA 2020)'
recordingDate: 1579151662
description: "Philip Paeps\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/178/\n\nWatch Trouble present a three-day workshop on ZFS in however little time the conference organisers were willing to allocate for it!  We'll cover topics from filesystem reliability over snapshots and volume management to future directions in ZFS.\r\n\r\nZFS is known as 'the last word in filesystems'. This workshop will get your hands dirty with installing, configuring and managing reliable and scalable storage systems with ZFS on FreeBSD. We will cover pool-based storage, optimising storage systems for performance and redundancy and practise zero-downtime recovery from common storage events such as failing disks or running out of space. Participants should bring a laptop with either VirtualBox or VMware installed.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n#linux.conf.au #linux #foss #opensource\n\nTue Jan 14 13:30:00 2020 at Room 9"
