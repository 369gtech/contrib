description: "WPF can be a tricky topic to get right. At first, it is fairly easy to get started. Then, you figure out that seemingly simple things aren't that simple. That's when you realize WPF was built on a different set of rules and ideas from WinForms. It works best with standards and systems in place. One popular standard is to use the MVVM pattern. In this video, I show you how to implement MVVM in WPF using a tool called Caliburn Micro.\n\nSource Code: https://leadmagnets.app/?Resource=WPFwithMVVM\nNewsletter signup (with exclusive discounts):  https://signup.iamtimcorey.com/ (your email will be kept safe and you will not be spammed).\nFacebook Page: https://www.facebook.com/IAmTimCorey/\n\nWant to see a full C# application built from scratch (now with WPF and ASP.NET Add-Ons available)?\n Check out this course: https://www.iamtimcorey.com/p/c-application-from-start-to-finish"
