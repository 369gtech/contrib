description: "Filmed at https://2017.dotgo.eu on November 6th in Paris. More talks on https://dotconferences.com/talks\n\nJohn explains how Category Theory can help you write better code, but without using the words \"Category\" or \"Theory\" (or monad or functor or any of the scary terminology). The idea behind \"Errors are Values\" from the Go blog can be applied to different kinds of programming problems, and we can make our code easier to compose by moving units of control flow into types."
