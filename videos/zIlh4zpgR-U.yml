description: "Software is the DNA of modern society. However, most organizations don’t seem to care about the people who are fundamentally responsible for implementing their digital vision: software developers. Yiannis Kanellopoulos explores several deficiencies SIG found in its current approach to making developers excel and realizing prophesied potential:\n\nTime-related pressure, bad code quality, and inadequate skills or knowledge are the three reasons for developers’ unhappiness at work.\nAlthough developers and executives agree that quality of the produced software is crucial, very few act upon it.\nThe main reason behind this inaction is lack of management support.\nSo how can you help? One word: empowerment.\n\nThis keynote is sponsored by SIG.\n\nSubscribe to O'Reilly on YouTube: http://goo.gl/n3QSYi\n\nFollow O'Reilly on: \nTwitter: http://twitter.com/oreillymedia\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/OReilly\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/oreillymedia\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/8459/"
