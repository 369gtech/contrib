description: "Speaker: Robert Cristobal, Frame316 (@frame316)\n\nHow do you break through the clutter of video content being created on a daily basis on social media. If you are a thought leader, an entrepreneur or even a layman with a serious message to tell, how do you use video to send a message across. Is the word “viral” a good thing? Is this something that can be made?\n\nYou don’t need advanced video editing skills, or the most expensive camera to get started with creating value-centric content for social media. All you need is a clear message and a smart phone at the very least.\n\nLearn the thought process behind designing video content that would resonate with your target audience, use your authentic voice to communicate a message and use a specific strategy to build your audience.\n\nhttp://framethreesixteen.com/\n\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/blessedwind/designing-video-content-for-social-media-marketing\n\nEvent Page: https://www.facebook.com/events/830738897037612/\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/HqFO/"
