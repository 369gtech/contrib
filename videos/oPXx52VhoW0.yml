description: 'During this April 2019 meetup, Uber data scientist Hesen Peng demonstrates an easier way to model censored time-to-event data using Pyro.  In this presentation, Peng demonstrates how censored time-to-event data (data where the outcome variable is the time until the occurrence of an event of interest) is critical to the proper modeling and understanding of customer engagement on the Uber platform.'
