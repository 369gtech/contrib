description: "Data is everywhere! We build applications that collect it, and even better - other people collect it and give us access. But! Do we bring that data back to our apps? In this session, we'll talk about patterns for integrating data into our client-side applications and sweep through a collection of exciting libraries that work with those patterns.\n\nFor reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
