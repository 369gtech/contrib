description: 'We know that functional silos are bad and we should be moving towards autonomous teams aligned with business capabilities. But what are business capabilities and how do we find them? In this talk you will learn about Sociotechnical Organisation Design patterns. Patterns for designing teams and the software systems they maintain. You will learn about plays to optimise your organisation design and software architecture for the specific needs of your business, whether your goal is delivery speed, efficiency, user experience, or something else.'
