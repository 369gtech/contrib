description: "Jason Sams, Tim Murray \n\nRenderScript is an API for high-performance computation on Android using whatever processors are available on a device, including CPUs, GPUs, DSPs, and more. This talk will cover how to develop applications with RenderScript that are capable of running on any device running Gingerbread or greater.\n\nWe will walk you through accelerating a simple application and show how we can provide high performance on different architectures with a single source base. Benchmarks comparing RS to the NDK will be presented.\n\nFor all I/O 2013 sessions, go to https://developers.google.com/live"
