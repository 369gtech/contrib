recordingDate: 1345750206
description: "Google Tech Talk\nAugust 13, 2012\n\nPresented by Philip Guo.\n\nABSTRACT\n\nA month ago, Philip Guo wrote a memoir documenting his Ph.D. experiences and released it online for free (http://pgbovine.net/PhD-memoir.htm ). As the first comprehensive account of an entire modern Ph.D. experience, over 50,000 people have read it, and hundreds have sent him heartfelt email responses. In this informal talk, Philip will recount some of the most valuable lessons he has learned in the past six years of working on his Ph.D. Philip will be delighted to take audience questions and provide a candid perspective on research, internships, job hunting, and career development for Ph.D. students. All Ph.D. interns -- and all undergrad interns who are considering pursuing a Ph.D. -- will benefit from this talk.\n\nAbout the Speaker:  Philip Guo just joined Google last month and is working with Peter Norvig on building tools to improve the teaching of programming and computer science. In his previous life, he received S.B. and M.Eng. degrees in EECS from MIT (2006) and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Stanford (2012)."
