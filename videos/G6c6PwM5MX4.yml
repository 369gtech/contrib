description: "Presented at droidcon Italy 2020\n\nGAME DEVELOPMENT WITH UNITY FROM AN ANDROID POINT OF VIEW\nJulien Salvi, Senior Android Engineer, Aircall\n\nDeveloping mobile games with Unity has become more and more popular these years, and Unity developers often need to tackle OS specific challenges.\n\nThrough this talk you will discover how to work with Unity as an Android Developer. You will see how to build Unity plugins using the JNI and Java/Kotlin, which is the most efficient way to link Unity with the Android framework.\n\nEvery Unity project can be exported as an Android Studio project with a Gradle support. You'll also see how you can integrate Unity inside a native Android Java/Kotlin application, or how to get a full control of the build process so you can benefit from the best of both worlds.\n\nhttps://it.droidcon.com/2020/​​​​\nhttps://twitter.com/Droidconit​​​​\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/showcase/dro​​​​...\nhttps://www.instagram.com/droidconit/​​​​\nhttps://www.facebook.com/droidconIt"
