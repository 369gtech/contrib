With Mob Programming 4 or 5 or more people work together at one computer to create software. It seems preposterous, but it's worked well for us, and for many teams. But how can this possibly work?!\nWell… I don't propose that I know the answer, but I have a few ideas - and one of the most compelling to me is the idea of flow. There are several common uses of the word, and in software development we hear people talk about being \"in the zone\", where there is an intense focus that leads to a highly productive state where the sense of time disappears and we experience a sense of ecstasy and clarity.\nBut there is another use of the work \"flow\" in the world of Lean Manufacturing and Lean Product Development.
