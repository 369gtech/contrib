description: "Drive faster feedback and higher quality with containerized test acceleration\n\nMohan Dattatreya, General Manager Acceleration Solutions, Electric Cloud \n\nFast CI cycles are absolutely necessary for shipping high quality software. But when practicing continuous delivery, CI is only a part of the process. Unit testing, functional testing, code coverage, and static analysis are becoming an increasingly-larger component of an efficient CD pipeline. \n\nHow can you maintain breadth and depth of coverage while these builds and tests grow without requiring people to skip important steps. I'll share best practices for leveraging dynamic resources and job parallelization, and discusses proven tips for giving developers and QA teams faster feedback. Using real life examples, I'll break down the approach and tools used to achieve incredible results.\n\nDOES17 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
