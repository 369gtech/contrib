title: 'Big O: How Code Slows as Data Grows'
language: English
recordingDate: 1528727289
description: "Big O notation is a computer science technique for analyzing how code performs as data gets larger.  It's a very handy tool for the working programmer, but it's often shrouded in off-putting mathematics.\n\nIn this talk, I'll teach you what you need to know about Big-O, and how to use it to keep your programs running well.  Big-O helps you choose the data structures and algorithms that will let your code work efficiently even on large data sets.\n\nYou can understand Big-O even if you aren't a theoretical computer science math nerd. Big-O isn't as mystical as it appears. It's wrapped in mathematical trappings, but doesn't have to be more than a common-sense assessment of how your code will behave.\n\nTalk given by Ned Batchelder at PyCon 2018.\n\nThanks to PyCon for giving us permission to post this talk. freeCodeCamp is not associated with this talk.
