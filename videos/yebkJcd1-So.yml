description: "Have you ever wondered about pair-development? Have you experienced it in your workplace? In this quicktime talk, I divulge my impressions about the impact of pair-programming at clients where I have seen genuine benefits. There are many great pragmatic results when pairing is delivered inside a flexible corporate and culturally sensitive environment.\n\nOn the other hand, pairing is not everyone’s cup of tea, I will provide pointers to defend against social anti-patterns and accidental bad practice. Of course, pair-development is closely associated with Agile software development lifecycle and extreme programming (XP), but don’t let that fact put you off from attending.\n\nFinally, pair-development is exciting way create high quality software for modern organisations. Whether you partially do this technology or apply it 100% of the time, it is a necessary step in a professional career.\n\nIf you are a developer, technical-lead or designer and you never ever worked in a close proximity situation with a work mate then this might be the lunchtime talk for you.\n\nPeter Pilgrim:\nCloud-Native Java Engineer, I develop, architect, coach and mentor Java and polyglot software, usually for `Bluechip Enterprises'.
