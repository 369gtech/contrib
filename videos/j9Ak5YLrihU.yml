description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nDeep Dive: Cloud Native Buildpacks - Joe Kutner, Heroku & Stephen Levine, Pivotal \n\nLearn why you need a buildpack and how to create one. We'll take advantage of caching and Docker layers to speed up rebuilds and deploys. Unlike Dockerfiles, buildpacks are composable. Finally, you'll learn how to rebase your application layers on a new image. This allow operators to efficiently handle the delivery of OS-level dependency upgrades. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Uag9"
