description: "http://www.cppcon.org\nâ€”\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2014\n--\nAll major web browsers are written in C++, but C++ is starting to fill an important role in web *content* as well: while JavaScript is the only standards-compliant language available to websites, compiling other languages to JavaScript has been shown to be practical and effective. This talk will explain how Emscripten, an LLVM-based open source compiler from C++ to JavaScript, lets you run a C++ codebase on the web at near-native speed. To achieve that level of performance, Emscripten emits asm.js, a strict subset of JavaScript that is easy for JavaScript engines to optimize, and was designed specifically as a compilation target for languages like C and C++. We'll also discuss some of the more challenging aspects of compiling C++ to JavaScript, stemming from the C++ language itself, libraries and toolchains, and some thoughts on possible solutions.\n--\nAlon is a researcher at Mozilla, where he works on Emscripten, an LLVM-based compiler from C++ to JavaScript, as well as other projects related to porting existing content to the web.Twitter handle: @kripken\n--\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
