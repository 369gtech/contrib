language: English
recordingDate: 1213036079
description: "Extend the Reach of your Google Apps Environment with Google APIs\r\nJackie Bodine, Ryan Boyd (Google) and Ron Hess (Salesforce.com)\r\n\r\nGoogle Apps already gives your organization an out-of-the-(virtual)-box solution for mail, calendaring, documents and more. What more could you want? How about a way to hook in Google Apps with all the systems you're already using? Or a way to migrate all your data? Or a way to combine data from multiple sources and create a company dashboard? This session will provide an overview of the capabilities of several APIs available for Google Apps customers: Calendar, Spreadsheets, Documents List, as well as some APIs available for Domain Administrators: provisioning, reporting, email migration. We will also discuss some ways Google has used the APIs in our own implementation and leave time for your questions. This talk is recommended for people who are using Google Apps, considering Google Apps or are interested in providing solutions for the thousands of businesses using Google Apps.\r\n\r\nParticipants should have a basic understanding of the Google Apps product suite. Some experience with software integration is recommended but not required."
