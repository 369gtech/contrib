To solve it I have created a  new small opensource library.\n\nWith gen_perstistence  all events coming to your modules are stored to the disk and replayed on the restart but it’s also possible to store a snapshot of the state to reduce the recovery time. An implementation of gen_statem and gen_server with persistence is also provided.\n\nRead the full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/benoit-chesneau/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - BENOIT CHESNEAU\nP2P solutions and database craftsman\n\nBenoît Chesneau is an IT craftsman, living near Paris.
