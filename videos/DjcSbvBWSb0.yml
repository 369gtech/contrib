title: 'Edge Conf 2: Rendering Performance'
recordingDate: 1380140527
description: '''As slick as native'' is a common boast for HTML5 developers. Web developers are not used to dealing in frame rates and memory consumption, but increasingly they need to. If UX is king, the web can only win when rendering is easier. We need great tools, skilled developers that know how to use them, and improvements in the platform to make the task easier in the first place. This session will address the challenges of rendering interfaces in a performant way in the browser.'
