description: "I have to say I wasn't the best hiring manager a few years ago but with each new role and each new candidate, I have learned a lot about hiring great talent, from how to write good job advertisements, how to structure your interviews, how to make the best out of an hour face-to-face interviews with each candidate, how to read and understand body language and last but not least, how to decide who is the best person for your organisation.\n\nIsabel is a highly innovative and award-winning web technologist and people manager with over 15 years industrial experience in the Internet and web development industry. She has an extensive experience in building high traffic and high profile websites. She is passionate about personal leadership, career development, and women in technology.\n\nAs a Development Manager and a Head of Front-end Engineering at Gumtree Australia, Isabel currently manages 12+ software developers and tech leads specialising in backend and frontend technologies and act as a guild lead/subject matter expert on front-end domain.  \n\nWhen she is not at work, she enjoys spending time with her family and she is a mum to a cute and cheeky 5 years old girl.  \n\nFor more on YOW! conferences, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
