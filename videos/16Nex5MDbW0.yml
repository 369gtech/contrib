title: 'How to develop to be compliant with OAuth 2.1 out of the gate - Nahid Farrokhi - NDC London 2021'
language: English
recordingDate: 1628001076
description: "Authorization and authentication are two of the main problems in modern web applicationâ€™s security. They were both solved by OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect(OIDC). OAuth community has patched and added to the OAuth spec over the years. If you want to implement a secure OAuth solution today, it requires reading so many RFCs and Best Current Practices (BCPs). OAuth 2.1 is an in-progress effort to consolidate and simplify the most commonly used features of OAuth 2.0. I want to discuss the details of OAuth 2.1, and the development approach for current projects to be compliant with OAuth 2.1 out of the gate.\nTo demo the implementation, I use .NET 5 and IdentityServer4, which is one of the most popular open source frameworks for OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0 on ASP.NET Core."
