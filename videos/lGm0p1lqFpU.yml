title: 'Delivering Progressive Delivery With Service Mesh'
language: English
recordingDate: 1568918592
description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io\n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nContinuous delivery has been a driving force behind software development, testing and deployment for years, and CI/CD best-practices are evolving with the advent of new technologies like Kubernetes and Istio.\n\nProgressive delivery, a term coined by James Governor of Redmonk, is a new approach to continuous delivery that includes “a new basket of skills and technologies… Such as canarying, feature flags, [and] A/B testing at scale”.\n\nAndrew will demo a canary deployment combining service mesh and Flagger, a progressive delivery operator. Traditional canary deployments shift traffic, so bad canaries still partially degrade user experience - Andrew will show an enhancement that mirrors traffic before shifting, which can prevent bad canaries from being visible to any users. He will compare traffic mirroring to other techniques, exploring when you might choose what kinds of progressive delivery."
