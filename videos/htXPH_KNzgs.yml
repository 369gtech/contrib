description: "by Mark Spanbroek, Marcin Czenko and Stefan van den Oord\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/H.2215/cogito_identity.webm\n\n\nWe present Cogito, a mobile app that helps you remain in control of your\nidentity. It supports a friendly way to identify yourself to websites, perform\nblockchain transactions and encryption. But most importantly, it guarantees that\nyour identity is really owned by you. We believe this to be a good starting\npoint for true privacy online. Identity may seem like a boring topic. Haven't we solved the problem of how to\nidentify ourselves to websites a hundred different ways? Isn't this a solved\nproblem? \n\nWe argue that in order to guarantee true privacy it is essential to introduce\nnew ways to identify ourselves. \n\nWe present Cogito, a mobile app that helps you remain in control of your\nidentity. Use it to create multiple facets of your identity to separate for\ninstance your working life from your personal life. \n\nTraditionally, identities are bestowed on you by others. Your passport is issued\nto you by your government. Your bank account is given to you by a bank. Website\ncredentials are given to you by the owner of the website. \n\nThese identities are ultimately not under your control. You get them on loan\nfrom the institutes that issue them, and they are free to retract them as they\ndeem necessary. This is no basis for true control over your data. This is no\nbasis for privacy. \n\nWith Cogito we've taken a cue from blockchains and PGP and use cryptographic\nidentities. This involves generating a public-private key pair in which the\npublic part is used as your identity (similar to a passport number or bank\naccount number). The private key you keep to yourself because you can use it to\nprove that you are the owner of the identity. \n\nThese self-sovereign identities are created and maintained by their owners. They\ncan not be taken away from them and are therefore completely under their\ncontrol. We believe that this is a prerequisite for true privacy. \n\nWith Cogito we aim to make these self-sovereign identities very easy to use.\nUsing a Cogito identity on a website is therefore as simple as scanning a QR\ncode. Signing a blockchain transaction or decrypting data is as simple as\npressing the 'accept' button. \n\nIn our FOSDEM session, we will demonstrate not only how Cogito works, but also\nwhat developers can do with Cogito. We will discuss the architecture, show the\ndemo app and the tutorial. We invite those who are interested to help develop\nCogito further. \n\nRoom: H.2215 (Ferrer)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 12:20:00+01"
