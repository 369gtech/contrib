title: '"DAING - A monitoring stack for datacentres" - Dave Kempe, Oliver Lowe (LCA 2020)'
recordingDate: 1579217210
description: "Dave Kempe, Oliver Lowe\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/238/\n\nWe will provide a working lab for Icinga, Icinga Director, Netbox, Ansible and Grafana, to allow you to document, manage and monitor datacentre infrastructure at scale.  These components provide a platform that you can document infrastructure, and have it automatically monitored.\r\n\r\nThis lab will be useful for anyone who cares about physical servers, switches, routers etc, and wants to have a better way to manage their lifecycle.  It will be pretty fast paced and assume you have some Linux system administration knowledge.  \r\n\r\nYou will need a laptop capable of running virtualbox with spare 4G of ram, and 10G of diskspace. You can follow along without a laptop, as we will walk through the various components and show how they work together.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n#linux.conf.au #linux #foss #opensource\n\nThu Jan 16 10:45:00 2020 at Room 9"
