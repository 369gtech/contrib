description: "Andrew and Matt add search functionality to the Hacker News reader app in this episode of The Boring Show. They demonstrate how you can use the Material package to wire search into the UI - the result is one call to launch the API and a single class to return the widgets that present the UI for searching.\n\nPlease leave us your feedback in the comments, and let us know what you would like us to build next!
