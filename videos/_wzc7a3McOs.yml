description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2016\n—\nThis is a philosophical talk. It deals with ideals, aims, and ways of approximating those. It deals with practical constraints and risks. It gives short examples. It presents a perspective of what drives the evolution of C++. What is C++ and what it must become over the next years for its success to continue? This involves both social and technical points. Towards the end, I discuss the direction of C++ future evolution, give some opinions, point to urgently needed new features, and discuss how to manage until they are part of the standard.\n— \nBjarne Stroustrup\nMD, Morgan Stanley\nC++: history, design, use, standardization, future; performance, reliability; software developer education; | distributed systems\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
