description: "This talk discusses the impact of quantum computers on cryptographic algorithms and the changes that are required to protect against both passive and active attacks. We cover the new set of public key schemes that are being proposed, the implied security thereof, as well as their practicality when deployed in real world systems. We also discuss the industry challenges and complexities of the roadmap to transition current cryptographic systems to quantum-resistant alternatives. \n\n=== \n\nChief Research Scientist â€“ Crypto Center, Technology Innovation Institute, with 15+ years of experience in applied cryptography, trusted computing, and embedded systems security.
