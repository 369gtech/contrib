title: 'Focusing on A and E in Chromatic Scale - Jenia Barabanov'
recordingDate: 1572166788
description: "Did you know that chromatic scale is a musical scale with twelve pitches, each a semitone above or below its adjacent pitches? No? It’s fine, this talk is not about music. “A” for Angular, “E” for Extension. Chromatic, well, you can guess…\n\nIn this talk, Jenia covers Chrome extensions in general and how to incorporate Angular in a Chrome extension."
