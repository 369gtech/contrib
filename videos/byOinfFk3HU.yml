description: "Erlang Factory SF Bay Area 2013\nMore info and slides on the website: http://www.erlang-factory.com/conference/SFBay2013/talks\n\nMongooseIM provides a unique instant messaging solution when massive volume is required. The growth of social media communication has resulted in the fact that the ceiling is quickly reached when successful projects take off. MongooseIM secures performance and stability.\n\nIn this talk I present lessons learnt when scaling messaging servers using common PC, cloud environments or a dedicated data centre. I demonstrate what bottlenecks we encountered and how to work around them in order to scale to millions of users. I also explain why MongooseIM and Erlang are a good baseline for building a custom messaging solution."
