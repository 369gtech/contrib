title: 'Keynote: Testing as an equal 1st class citizen (to coding) - Jon Jagger - NDC TechTown 2021'

recordingDate: 1635889792
description: "Ten years ago, many companies didn't really pay attention to testing. Then devops took off and people began to see the potential of automated CI/CD pipelines. Soon they started to understand that increasing deployment frequency doesn't work unless you also increase quality! And so people found themselves motivated to learn how to test more effectively!\n\nNow testing is much more prevalent, and the companies going the fastest and with the highest quality are also the ones doing the most automated testing. But even in these companies testing is 'subservient' to coding.\nIn this talk I will present the idea of testing and coding as being\n__equal__ first-class citizens in a co-evolving system. I will elaborate on what I mean by that. I will also present some practical tips and techniques based on this idea, some of which I am confident you will never have come across before, but which might just change the way you think about development."
