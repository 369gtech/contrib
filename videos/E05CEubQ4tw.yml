description: "Google Tech Talks\nJuly 31, 2007\n\nABSTRACT\n\nWe present a variation of the indexing problem involving constraints on the location of the pattern in the text. We call the variation \\emph{range non-overlapping indexing} problem: given a text $T=t_{1}.. t_{n}$ over alphabet $\\Sigma$, efficiently preprocess it such that future queries of the form ``given a pattern $P=p_{1}.. p_{m}$ over $\\Sigma$ and two text locations $i \\leq j$, find a sequence of locations where $P$ appears in $T$ between locations $i$ and $j$, such that the occurrences are \\emph{non-overlapping} and their number is maximal''. This problem thus generalizes the \\emph{string statistics problem}~\\cite{AP96, BLOP02}, in which we only had..."
