description: "Kito Mann, Principal Consultant, Virtua, Inc.\n\nWith support for every major browser (including mobile browsers) and bindings for many languages, Selenium WebDriver is doubtless the most popular open source browser automation tool. Using it with the latest version of JUnit and smart techniques such as the Page Object pattern, you can build a foundation for quality integration and functional and regression testing.
