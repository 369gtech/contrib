description: "Broadening our vision to design for everyone is a conscious act of innovation. Instead of focusing on barriers, we can focus on enabling expression in multiple ways, for products that are modern, global, and responsive, and which work for people with a wide range of abilities. All of the tools and principles of an excellent user experience also support accessibility, just as web design that is responsive to diversity of devices is also responsive to a diversity of human needs.\n\nThe core design principles for a web for everyone are:\n\n    People first: designing for differences\n    Clear purpose: well-defined goals.\n\n    Solid structure: built to standards.\n    Easy interaction: everything works.\n\n    Helpful wayfinding: guides users.\n    Clean presentation: visual design supports meaning.\n    Plain language: creates a conversation.\n    Accessible media: supports all senses.\n\n    Universal usability: creates delight\n\nIf we aim to design for all senses we can focus on good design to create delightful user experiences where accessibility and usability work together. Don't miss this informative webcast presentation.\nAbout Whitney Quesenbery\n\nWhitney Quesenbery combines a fascination with people and an obsession to communicate clearly with her goal of bringing user research insights to designing products where people matter.
