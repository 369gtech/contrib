description: "In this workshop, we set ourselves a challenge: Pairing remotely while we participate in an exercise run by David Lluna, Site Reliability Engineering Manager, which serves us as an introduction to the Twelve - Factor App.\n\nIn this dynamic kata, we explored this methodology for building software-as-a-service apps written in any programming language, and which use any combination of backing services.\n\nThank you David, for making this fun kata possible, where different levels could learn together and share their skills."
