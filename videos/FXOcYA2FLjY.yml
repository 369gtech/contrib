description: "Agile Tour Vilnius 2020. The New Normal\n\n    Facilitating Intentional Agility from Home\n    Thomas van Zuijlen\n\n    Why should things return to how they were, anyway? As a Product Owner, Scrum Master, or engineer, you already knew that nothing stays the same. You already had the tools to inspect and adapt. It’s just your stakeholders that are now catching up.\n    On days filled with video calls, with unprecedented access to experts across and beyond your company, it becomes extra important to ask “why are we doing this?” - and answer that question together.\n\n    Once a shared purpose and scope is affirmed, it’s a matter of facilitation to make sure the experience and outcomes are valuable to all.\n\n    Facilitation in agile environments, distributed or otherwise, can make a world of difference. I’ll share my experience (and mistakes) as a facilitator and Scrum Master, to show you how to\n    * have better, purposeful meetings by focusing on intent;\n    * facilitate your events and meetings to increase the value for all participants;\n    * level the playing field to ensure equal participation and inclusion of all voices.\n\n    And in the process, drive for greater agility."
