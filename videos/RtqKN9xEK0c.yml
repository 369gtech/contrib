title: 'SOLID in the Wild: Life When Your Software is Actually Soft - David Edwards, Mike Kenyon, Zoe Gagnon'
language: English
recordingDate: 1513301792
description: "We talk a lot about the five SOLID principles, but we tend to do so theoretically; we don't always get to see examples of the principles in real-life production code.\n\nThis is the story of how we shipped a real-world Spring codebase for a high traffic online marketplace. Besieged by looming deadlines and sudden requirement changes, specific usages of the five SOLID principles saved the day in pyrotechnic fashion.\n\nWe'll talk about what SOLID looks like outside the laboratory, the ways it saved our skin when it mattered most, and the joy of working on a system that likes to change.\n\n\nSlides: TBA\n \nDavid Edwards, Software Engineer, Pivotal\nMike Kenyon, Software Engineer, Pivotal\nZoe Gagnon, Software Engineer, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2017"
