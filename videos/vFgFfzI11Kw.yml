description: "Speaker Info:\n\nTom Bleier, Vice President, QuakeFinder Humanitarian R&D Project For thirty-seven years Tom Bleier has developed, built, and tested complex defense and commercial satellites and ground control systems. Early in his career Tom became interested in understanding the physics of the pre-earthquake process. Based on the theories developed by Stanford University scientists after the Loma Prieta earthquake and the USGS observations of earthquake lights, he developed ultra-low frequency (ULF) magnetometers to detect electromagnetic signals at the onset of large earthquakes that may provide the key to understanding the warning signs of deadly seismic hazards. What started as an educational outreach program, donating time and materials for the ULF magnetometer kits to a handful of high-schools, has expanded over the last decade into a web-based network of over 110 sensors that detect and record ULF background signals—looking for earthquakes.\n\nAbstract:\n\nCan We Forecast Earthquakes Yet? - The Electomagnetic Aspects of Earthquakes - What are the Physical Processes Involved? - Are \"Short Term Forecasts\" Possible? - QuakeFinder's Use of Electromagnetic monitoring to detect quakes 1-14 days prior.
