These requirements can be high availability, resource efficiency and other policies and heuristics. This talk will provide an overview of the new and upcoming features in the scheduler, including the scheduler framework, and the new component config API that enables scheduling profiles. In addition, we'll present updates on other sig-scheduling projects like the descheduler, scheduler-plugins. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ekHV"
