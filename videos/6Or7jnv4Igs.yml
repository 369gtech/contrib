description: "Watch the lecture by Simona Cotin! Modern applications have shifted their focus on the USER. On one hand the more personalized your application is the higher chances are your users are going to enjoy the experience of navigating it. The first step of getting to know your users is enabling them to save their preferences through a seamless sign up and login experience. More importantly, users need to feel secure and safe while using your app. As basic as it sounds, authentication and authorization have always been a complex task which many of us have struggled with but have had a huge impact on our users' experience. This talk is going to walk you through some of the best practices for authentication and session management in Angular apps. We're going to learn about some of the most common web security vulnerabilities and how to avoid them. Finally, we're going to learn how to leverage the new angular router for improved authentication.\n\nThis spring over 9400 IT specialists took part in Code Europe, the largest programming conference in Poland!
