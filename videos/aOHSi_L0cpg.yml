description: "Anand Ranganathan\nVP Solutions\nUnscrambl\n\nChatbots promise to improve customer experience by providing faster service, improving cross-channel consistency, providing front-ends for troubleshooting, functioning as part of the retail process and automating some outbound and inbound marketing activities. However, most chatbots today are restricted to supporting simple question/answer scenarios. In this talk, I shall present our architecture for personalized and contextual chatbots, running on the Oracle Cloud, that are able to provide a richer experience to customers. These chatbots maintain relevant context about customers and their recent activities, interests, issues and needs. They are powered by analytics providing real-time and personalized recommendations and offers."
