Highlighting the importance of human in, sometimes idealized, world of the software development, while the human is prone to errors.\n\nSlides & full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/dmytro-lytovchenko/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - DMYTRO LYTOVCHENKO\nRefactoring terrible software to be pretty and readable\n\nErlang and C++ professional, Rust, C# and Python enthusiast, 9 years of Erlang experience, 20+ years of C and C++.\n\nMore on Dmytro Lytovchenko: https://codesync.global/speaker/dmytro-lytovchenko/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM SF 2020\nCode BEAM SF is powered by Code Sync.
