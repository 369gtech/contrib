This session will take a look at how to pick the right ciphers for your application, the challenges with enforcing your ciphers with built-in methods in either your application or the Cloud Foundry control plane, and an easy-to-add option that lets you regain control of which ciphers are supported by your application even when running in a multi-tenant environment. The session will wrap up with a behind the curtain look at securing large multi-tenant Cloud Foundry environments, including challenges and potential solutions.\n\nTo learn more about Cloud Foundry, The Proven Developer Experience For Kubernetes click here: https://www.cloudfoundry.org/"
