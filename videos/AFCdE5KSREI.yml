description: "NorDevCon 2014 - 28th February 2014 \n\n10 years of doing BDD all wrong \nby Liz Keogh \n(@lunivore)\n\n10 years ago, Dan North first came up with the idea of BDD: using examples in conversation to explore the behaviour of systems, then carrying those examples into code. Since then, we've learnt a lot about how BDD works, how it works best, and how it can fail horribly! Even the most experienced BDD practitioners have learnt a lot from their failures... but what were they? And how are we failing now?\n\nIn this talk, Liz takes a look at things we said back then which we shouldn't have; ways in which we abused BDD more than we used it; and things that we're still doing all wrong today. Come along to see the mistakes, listen to the stories, and hear the apologies!\n\nAbout Liz\n\nLiz is an experienced Lean and Agile consultant and well-known international speaker. Coming from a strong technical background, her work covers a wide variety of topics, from software development and architecture to psychology and complexity thinking. She is best known for her involvement in the BDD community, and was awarded the Gordon Pask award in 2010 for deepening existing ideas in the space and \"coming up with some pretty crazy ones of her own\".\n\nhttp://www.nordevcon.com/nordevcon2014/"
