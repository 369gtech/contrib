title: 'High-speed personalization with Next.js - Steve Sewell - (Next.js Conf 2021)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1635396151
description: "Static site generation is incredible for performance and uptime, but can prevent you from delivering personalized experiences to your users. Previously, our only options were to load personalized parts of pages client-side, but that can negate much of the performance value of SSG, and create poor user experiences (popping content, layout shifts, etc). In this talk, we will cover how to deliver extremely fast and personalized experiences with Next.js, so you can get the best of both worlds. We will also cover how Builder.io integrates with this and Next.js incremental static regeneration to create high-speed, hyper personalization with Next.js using no-code.\n\nhttps://github.com/BuilderIO/nextjs-builder-edge-personalization\n\nSteve Sewell\nFounder and CEO at Builder.io\n@steve8708"
