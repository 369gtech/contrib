description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nMaximizing Workload's Performance With Smarter Runtimes - Krisztian Litkey & Alexander Kanevskiy, Intel\n\nMitigating noisy neighbours in the world of containers is not an easy task. There are several solutions exists and many of those have own limitations. This presentation will be focusing on exploring new ways of innovations for container runtimes that helps get maximum performance and resource utilisation without modifications of the workloads. In this talk we are planning to briefly cover existing extension points for containerd and CRI-O, talk about new ideas from NRI proposal, as well as covering evolution of dynamic resource usage optimisations in our project CRI-Resource-Manager. We want to share our experience on dealing with heterogenous CPU resources, multi-tiered Memory, Caches, Memory Bandwidth and Block I/O usage. We want to demonstrate how using various metrics and hints provided by Linux kernel can lead to improvements of workload performance and dynamic hardware resource utilisation optimisations."
