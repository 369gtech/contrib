Vehicles are not only a mean of transportation, but they pursue to be the drivers' control center with multiple software components onboard. To keep pace with evolving customer expectations and the newest technological solutions, vehicle's software requires frequent updates. However, the delivery process in a scaled up environment is not straightforward. Developers and operators have to face challenges, which are unusual in the typical Cloud Native world. Even basic service deployment may be complicated due to network performance or geographical considerations. During this talk, Rafał will show how to use Kubernetes, KubeEdge, k3s, Jenkins and RSocket for building continuous deployment pipelines, which ship software directly to the car, deals with rollbacks and connectivity issues. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UaaU"
