description: "The Telco Networking Journey to Cloud Native: The Good, Bad, and Ugly - Heather Kirksey, The Linux Foundation \n\nAs telecom SPs re-imagine their large-scale communications networks, they look to embrace cloud native architecture & technologies. The journey from proprietary hardware to agile, scalable, & OSS for implementing internet, edge & mobile services (LTE and 5G), known as NFV, began several years ago using the first wave of virtualization technologies. As organizations like AT&T, China Mobile, & Orange look ahead to next-gen services, they're increasingly looking to implement fully realized cloud native network services, i.e., Cloud-native Network Functions (CNFs) running on cloud native infrastructure such as Kk8s & network service mesh using CI/CD & automated testing. Citing examples from open source communities and organizations migrating network functions to the cloud, this session will review lessons learned challenges faced by telcos today as well as whatâ€™s in store for tomorrow. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/GrX0"
