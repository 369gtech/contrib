title: 'Learning from your bugs by Henrik Warne'
recordingDate: 1550057988
description: "Bugs are great learning opportunities. So how do we make sure we learn as much as possible from the bugs we find and fix? One way is to reflect on what made the bug hard to solve, and how we could avoid this type of bug in the future. For the past 15 years I have written down short descriptions of the trickiest bugs I have solved. This simple method has helped me distill patterns that have influenced how I write, test and debug code.\n\nIn this talk I will share my experience with this method. I will also present 18 lessons I have learned from going through over 200 such bug entries. The lessons include coding practices I have adopted to avoid similar bugs, rules for effective testing, and useful debugging techniques and heuristics.\n\nHenrik Warne\nTriOptima"
