description: "Lightning Talk: Cloud Foundry Monitoring: How to Never Leave Your Deployment Unattended - Anton Soroko, Altoros\n\nIt wasn’t that long ago when, to enable end-to-end monitoring of Cloud Foundry deployments for our clients, we had to set up and configure a complex combination of several monitoring tools. An idea would not leave our heads that there had to be a one-stop solution to handle monitoring at all levels of the deployment, including VM instances, Cloud Foundry’s internal and external components, BOSH, services and applications. Unable to find such a tool, we built one ourselves. During the talk, Anton is going to provide two real-life stories how we managed to avoid an early-stage disaster and saved the client's deployment with an all-in-one highly available and multitenant monitoring stack developed by Altoros for Cloud Foundry.\n\nAbout Anton Soroko\nAltoros\nCloud Foundry Engineer\nBelarus\nLinkedIn Connect  Websitehttps://altoros.com/\nAnton Soroko is a Cloud Foundry/DevOps Engineer at Altoros with a strong background in SRE activities.
