description: "Whilst the Web and streaming has more or less stopped people being interested in watching OTA television on a computer, it remains a fun problem to work on. Me TV started life when creating software PVR and media centres was \"a thing\". MythTV and Kodi won that race and Me TV faded into obscurity. But I wanted a Freeview (UK DVB T2) player, not a PVR.\n\nThis presentation skims through some of the technical fun and hassles of picking up a \"dead project\" and working on it as a personal project, and then discovering there are users. There will be commentary on evolving vs rewriting codebases, some programming languages, some APIs and their bindings, and tool support.\n\nAssuming there is TV signal in the venue, there will be demonstrations.\n\nOh, and there will be code."
