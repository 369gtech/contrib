Modula had been designed by Niklaus Wirth the inventor also of Pascal. This talk will discuss the large scale international efforts in the 1980’s to create a standard systems programming language. That work led to Chill by the CCITT and to Ada by the DoD. It is surprising how many strange ways of process communication that were invented. All of those languages, however, were imperative yet Lisp and Prolog had been used for some successful applications at Ericsson. The time was ripe to combine these efforts and the Computer Science Laboratory was set up to take the work further. The new programming language was nearly named EriLang. Erlang is the measure of traffic load well-known to everybody in the telecoms industry and was a much better choice.\n\nRead the full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/bjarne-daecker/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - BJARNE DÄCKER\nHonorary doctorate at Linköping university\n\n\nBjarne Däcker worked 36 years at Ericsson, first as programmer and systems designer and the last 18 years as manager of the Computer Science Laboratory. http://www.cs-lab.org/\n\nBjarne Däcker holds a licentiate of technology from the Royal Institute of Technology and an honorary doctorate from Linköping university. \n\nHe was chairman of the steering committee for the Swedish national program for Computer Science research for five years. Bjarne has also been Swedish representative on the committee for EU’s IT prize. He is a member of the Swedish Royal Academy of the Engineering Sciences.\n\nAs a pensioner, Bjarne Däcker has taken up university studies and has a B.A. in Archaeology.\n\nMore on Bjarne Däcker: https://codesync.global/speaker/bjarne-daecker/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM STO 19\nCode BEAM STO is powered by Code Sync.
