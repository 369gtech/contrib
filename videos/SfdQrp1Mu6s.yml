title: 'Transactions Returning to NoSQL'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433255502
description: "Over the last few years, we have seen the rise of NoSQL and big data. The CAP theorem is often cited as a reason for many of the architectural decisions used in the development of NoSQL, and one consequence is that most implementations do not support transactions. This lack of transactions offers benefits for some applications, but it has certain downsides, particularly in terms of fault tolerance and integrating with existing Java EE applications. As a result, the last year or so has seen many NoSQL implementations adopt transactions in one way or another. This session examines this trend back to adopting transactions, why it is happening, and what it means for the future.\n\n\nAuthor:\nMark Little\nDr. Mark Little leads JBoss technical direction, research and development.
