description: "Video from Devoxx Poland 2019.\n\nWhen was the last time you took a day off? How many times this week have you worked overtime? These questions are related to one thing we all experience on a daily basis - stress. Employes who are trapped by their routine to \"deliver business value at all cost\", often forget to take care of themselves. Unfortunately, this work-related stress affects our loved ones too, because work-life balance that we all hear about, usually means work-life stress.\n\nWhat if I were to say that it does not have to be this way? In this talk, we discuss ways how to relax and avoid \"Stress Driven Development.\" We acknowledge the stressors, and draft a comprehensive guide to removing stress at work and in our personal lives."
