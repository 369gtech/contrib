description: 'There were once browsers without element inspector, CSS without border-radius, JavaScript without arrow functions. Although a world without Flexbox and Template Literals sounds scary ... I invite you to reflect on what is really the darkest time for Front-end developers. Let''s ask ourselves if the times were dark when we were worried about border-radius or if we should really be worried about the current times, where a simple landing needs 800kb of JavaScript to display.'
