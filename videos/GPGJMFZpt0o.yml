description: "Three out of four development teams face issues with bugs, defects, or delays when it’s time to release new features or products. That’s almost all teams! It’s no wonder techniques like feature flagging, gradual rollouts, and A/B testing are quickly rising from niche to mainstream to help teams mitigate risk by iterating gradually and validating their ideas with data. But for every game-changing A/B test, there can be a trail of testing mistakes that lead well-meaning teams down the wrong path. \n\n \nIn this session, you’ll learn how to strategically create feature flags in multiple development environments and roll them out to a subset of customers. We’ll explore the possibilities feature flags create and explain how to use best practices such as visibility and accountability to align different flags into a cohesive feature flagging system. You’ll leave with actionable tactics you can quickly apply and see the impact.\n\nPlease bring a laptop and code editor of your choice.\n\nJustina Nguyen: Developer Evangelist Lead, Optimizely\n\nSlides: link to come"
