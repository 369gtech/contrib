description: "More often than none, an Android project's build.gradle files grow larger and more complex with time. This talk will look at the underappreciated buildSrc folder, which allows you to create plugins directly from your project, but also can help you make your build.gradle files cleaner and more readable.\n\nAbout the speaker\nXavier F. Gouchet is a Senior Software Engineer at Datadog. He has been dabbling in Android since the Cupcake days and has been working as a professional Android engineer since 2012. His main interests are testing, static analysis tools, and architecture best practices.\n\nAbout Mobile Era\nMobile Era is organized by a team of enthusiasts across several technology companies in Oslo. We're passionate about developing mobile apps and want to see a kick-ass event in Oslo for people like ourselves. The organizing committee consists of developers who are also active in organizing open events, conferences and meetups in the Oslo developer community.\n\nOur topics: iOS / Android, Mobile web / PWA, Cross-platform / JS-to-Native, IoT / Hardware, Mobile UX / Accessibility\n\nFollow us on:\n\nWebsite: mobileera.rocks\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/mobileeraconf\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/mobileeraconf/\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/mobileeraconf"
