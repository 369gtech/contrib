description: "Keynote: Lessons Learned in Building a gRPC Implementation for .NET Core - Sourabh Shirhatti, Senior Program Manager & John Luo, Software Engineer, Microsoft \n\nJohn Luo and Sourabh Shirhatti are part of the ASP.NET team at Microsoft working on the .NET Core implementation of gRPC. In this talk, they'll cover their experience in building a new gRPC implementation. They'll start by covering the design and limitations imposed by the existing .NET gRPC library and how the library attempts to address these concerns. As part of this deep dive, they'll also cover some of the design decisions that made in designing an opinionated framework and showcase the productivity and performance benefits introduced by the new library."
