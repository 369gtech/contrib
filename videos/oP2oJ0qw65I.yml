description: "Spring Boot made a huge stride to make it easier than ever to develop the next generation of cloud native applications and is the most popular framework. With Spring Cloud, your Spring applications can stay cloud-vendor agnostic while leveraging the power of the target cloud deployment. With a simple configuration switch, you are able to move your local application to run in an on-prem datacenter, or in the cloud with managed services.\n\nGoogle and Pivotal partnered to develop Spring Cloud adapters for Google Cloud Platform. With Spring Cloud GCP, you can quickly develop cloud native applications & harness the power of Google infrastructure. In this session, we'll introduce a number of projects we've been working on, including:\n\nSpring Integration channel adapters for Cloud Pub/Sub to use with Spring Messaging\nSpring Resource abstraction for Cloud Storage to inject shared file resources\nSpring Boot Starters for Google Cloud SQL to quickly connect to managed MySQL or PostgreSQL databases\nWe'll develop an application locally, and see how you can easily swap out components to leverage Google Cloud infrastructure without changing code.\n\n\n\nMark Fisher, Senior Staff, Pivotal\nJoão Martins, Software Engineer, Google\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2017"
