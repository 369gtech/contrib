In this talk, we are going to cover a series of war stories and failure scenarios. We will talk about bugs (or design) that resulted in data loss, file system corruption, or storage simply refusing to come up. The limitations of storage subsystems, both what it can and can not do, will also be discussed     These failures have led to numerous enhancements in Kubernetes. We will review the lessons these failures have provided, and discuss how they have been vital to improving our handling of the storage subsystem.  \n\nhttps://sched.co/UadX"
