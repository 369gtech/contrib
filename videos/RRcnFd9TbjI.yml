description: "The functional style has a number of benefits: code is concise, more expressive, easier to understand, and easier to make change. But, the transition from imperative to functional style is a hard journey. It's not as much an issue of getting comfortable with the syntax. It's the challenge of thinking functionally. What better way to learn that transition than taking imperative code and refactoring it to a more of a functional style.\nIn this presentation we will start with multiple code examples that are written in imperative style and learn how to approach and refactor to functional style."
