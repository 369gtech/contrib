description: "Slides: http://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/cloud-foundry-cloud-native-community-and-momentum\n\nCloud Foundry is the foundation for cloud native applications to live and thrive. Our goal is to build this platform in an open community driving the momentum of a large scale project. In this talk you will learn about the current industry trends forming and how Cloud Foundry is working together around this in the open. You will also learn about contributions and where we see more and more of this taking place from single contributors to major companies and how this plays out.\n\nSpeaker: Jared Wray, Builder, Founder, Investor, CFF \nJared Wray is an early cloud pioneer and a visionary entrepreneur with a passion for building platforms and robotics. \n\nAs founder and CTO of Tier 3, Wray created the Tier 3 cloud and built it into an industry-recognized cloud innovation and performance leader. CenturyLink acquired Tier 3 in 2013 to form the foundation of CenturyLink Cloud. \n\nWray is a respected thought-leader in the enterprise cloud services space. He created the Iron Foundry open source project to enable .NET on the Cloud Foundry. \n\nAt CenturyLink, Wray reinvigorated the engineering core to create a future-proofed platform and engine. The team's’ velocity doubled under Wray’s leadership and this velocity outpaced 75% of the Gartner MQ in new services and features. \n\nFocusing on building teams at scale, Wray introduced an agile / lean manufacturing process over the standard waterfall process. This reduced the company’s average ship time from 18 months to just 21 days or less. This process was integrated into the engineering core for all hosting / cloud products at CenturyLink and has supported substantial growth as the company scaled from six core teams on the cloud to more than 30+ teams. \n\nA serial entrepreneur and advocate for founders, Wray builds and invests in companies. He works hard to enable companies and further the tech industry. Wray is an advisor and investor to companies including Promoter.io and Fons."
