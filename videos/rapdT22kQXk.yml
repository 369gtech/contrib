title: '#HITBCyberWeek D1T1 - Critical Infrastructure Data Breaches - An In-depth Analysis'
language: English
recordingDate: 1607139188
description: "In recent years, many enterprises in the world have suffered from leaks of sensitive customer or employee information due to APT attacks, malware attacks, insider leaks, or mis-configured settings. Data breaches have a considerable impact, not only harming corporate reputations and causing business to be lost, but also causing serious risk for customers. If leaked data flows into the hands of bad actors, we can easily imagine the harmful consequences. These risks equally affect the United States’ 16 critical infrastructures. If sensitive information about employees or external services leaks, hackers can easily apply it to social engineering or advanced continuous penetration attacks. However, a critical infrastructure security incident can cause more than financial loss – it can also create a threat to the safety of physical equipment or to people’s lives and property.\n\nThis research will collect publicly leaked data and share some of the traps and fun that we found during the analysis. We will also share how we have used our unique automatic analytical process for building on the cloud to conduct big data analysis on more than 10 billion pieces of data from 200 plus datasets, with a particular focus on the analysis of data leakage and password habits of 16 critical infrastructure service providers. Based on the in-depth analysis of our data, we will try to provide predictions and warnings to high-risk CI sectors that may be invaded due to information leakage. Finally, we will advise how to perform prevention and mitigation measures.\n\n\n=== \n\n\nMars Cheng is a threat researcher for TXOne Networks, blending a background and experience in both ICS/SCADA and Enterprise cybersecurity systems.
