description: "Speaker: Sergi Almar\r\n\n== Spring Boot with Docker and Kubernetes\n\nDocker and Kubernetes have revolutionized the software industry in the latest years. But how can we containerize our Spring Boot apps? In this presentation, we’ll see different options, from creating our Dockerfile, to tools like Jib and we’ll focus on the new support for Docker in Spring Boot 2.3 that leverages Buildpacks. After having our container, we’ll see how to deploy and run it on Kubernetes.\n\nAbout the speaker:\n \nSergi is a software engineer focused on the JVM and Spring ecosystem.
