title: 'Identity management in distributed applications using Dapr'
language: English
recordingDate: 1608188434
description: "Dapr makes microservice development easier in any language. Using its consistent APIs and reusable building blocks, developers can quickly build distributed applications that are both dynamic and portable. To secure these applications, Dapr provides automatic in-transit encryption using mutual TLS, SPIFFE-based application identity, and a granular set of easy to configure runtime access control policies. This session will review these options with a live demo of:\n\n-Trust relationship definition between microservices\n-Operation-level access policy\n-Component and secrets access scoping\n\nLinks:\nDapr Site: https://dapr.io/\nMark's Dapr Demos on GitHub: https://github.com/mchmarny/dapr-demos/tree/master/hardened"
