description: "Persuasive technologies, already controversial, become yet more potent with ubiquitous AI and abundant data. We are approaching an era of ‘hypernudge’, in which highly networked, adaptive, data-driven services can know and exploit every individual’s persuasive weak spots. Technologists must define the ethics of these interactions. At what point does a nudge become a shove? What are the social and political implications of irresistible automated persuasion? This session will explore the ethics of designing future behaviour and offer ways for technologists and designers to resist dystopian persuasive futures.\n\nWatch the rest of the PAIR UX Symposium talks here ? http://bit.ly/2lMnjyt\n\nSubscribe to the Google Developers channel ? http://goo.gl/mQyv5L"
