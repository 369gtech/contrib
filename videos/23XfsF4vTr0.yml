title: 'Alin Pandichi - Incremental Feature Development with Web Components'
recordingDate: 1531989092
description: 'As a developer, your responsibility is to deliver feature-rich applications fast. Sometimes, you can nail it with your eyes closed! Most of the times, you need a reliable technique to attack the complexity behind that user story with 10 acceptance criteria. During this live-coding session, I will show you one such technique. It might look like “user story slicing”, or “taking baby steps”. It’s more than that! I will start from the most simple requirement, and evolve the feature, bit by bit. I will add layers upon layers of Web Components in an almost mindless fashion. The feature will be ready to be pushed into production before you can say “incremental iterative development”. I’ll be using React, but it shouldn’t matter that much.'
