description: "Slides: http://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/no-time-like-the-present-establishing-technology-as-a-core-competency-at-allstate\n\nInsurance is one of many well established industries which is being rapidly disrupted by a number of forces including the emergence of direct sales, displacement of traditional underwriting by analytical capabilities and well funded new entrants. Allstate, founded in 1931 and the second largest Property and Casualty Insurer in the US, is pursuing the goal of creating a 22nd Century Corporation. In addition to acquiring esurance in 2011 and establishing a Strategic Ventures arm in 2015, Allstate set about recasting the organization's technical and engineering discipline to make it core to the company, and moving technology up the value chain. Learn more about how Allstate is building new applications that are evolutions of their core business, and modernizing decades of legacy investment. This talk will also address best practices to organizational change management and real experiences in successful technical collaboration across the globe.\n\nSpringOne Platform 2016 \nSpeaker: Opal Perry; VP & CIO, Allstate"
