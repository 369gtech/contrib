title: '.NET Data Security : Hope is not a Strategy - Stephen Haunts'
language: English
recordingDate: 1506326798
description: "Not encrypting your data is a risky move and just relying on hope that you won't get hacked and compromised is not a strategy.\n\nAs a software developer you have a duty to your employer to secure and protect their data. In this talk, you will learn how to use the .NET Framework to protect your data to satisfy confidentiality, integrity, non-repudiation, and authentication.\n\nThis talk covers random number generation, hashing, authenticated hashing, and password based key derivation functions. The talk also covers both symmetric and asymmetric encryption using DES, Triple DES, AES, and RSA. You then learn how to combine these all together to product a hybrid encryption scheme which includes AES, RSA, HMACS, and Digital Signatures."
