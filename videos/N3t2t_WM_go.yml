description: "Have you ever heard about NodeBots? In this talk (or show) you are going to learn about what a NodeBot is and how it's possible to do some electronics and robotics magic using JavaScript, from basics projects like controlling a LED to more advanced ones like a biped robot or crazy musical instruments like a theremin. Besides the cool things you can build in NodeBots the most awesome part of it is the community, you'll see what we are doing from the community point of view and how we are achieving social impact bringing more people from all ages to programming and electronics, specially in Latin america, through the NodeBots community.\n\nhttps://www.jsconfar.com/"
