description: "Quantum computing is advancing rapidly, from theory, to tangible technologies, to use cases and business development. The panel addresses advances in quantum technologies across hardware, software and communication layers. It also discusses how quantum computing is likely to revolutionize Crypto and AI technologies. \n\n=== \n\nDr. Marc Manzano is the Executive Director of Cryptographic R&D at DarkMatter, where he supervises the research and development teams. His current research interests are Post-Quantum Cryptography, Lightweight Cryptography, the intersection between Machine Learning and Cryptanalysis, and performance optimizations of cryptographic primitives implementations on a wide range of architectures. Dr. Marc has led the development of many secure cryptographic libraries and protocols in the past decade. Dr. Marc has a PhD in Computers Network Security done under the supervision of University of Girona (Spain) and Kansas State University (KS, US). He has presented more than 25 articles at International Conferences, published more than 10 journal papers and collaborated in several book chapters. \n\n--- \n\nEngineer in electronics and computer science, Yann Allain is an Entrepreneur, so called “cybersecurity expert” but who knows that he does not know everything. He is interested in the model “Do It Yourself”. he has founded Opale Security in 2008, and created one of the world’s leading IoT vulnerability research team before being acquired by a larger group in 2016. He has been working in the security industry for 25 years. His past activities were related to software security and hardware security . He was the leader of the Hardsploit Project. Yann speaks as a lecturer and trainer all over the world (Blackhat USA, Blackhat Europe, Hack In the box Amsterdam, TedX, Hack In Paris & more …). At night, he hacked into old computers and work on subjects normally “reserved” for academics … like quantum computing or Bio Hacking and many other things … Yann has a new project: He build his own Quantum computers based on Trapped Ions technology at NextGenQ (his new company).\n\n--- \n\nChief Research Scientist – Crypto Center, Technology Innovation Institute, with 15+ years of experience in applied cryptography, trusted computing, and embedded systems security. International Experience: USA, Middle East, Australia, Africa, Asia\n\nEducation\n\n* Ph.D. with Highest Honors in Computer Engineering from Princeton University\n* Masters Degree in Computer Engineering from Princeton University\n* B.Eng. in Computer and Communication Engineering from American University of Beirut\n\nEmployment History\n\n* Senior Vice President, Special Projects at DarkMatter LLC, UAE\n* Lead Senior Associate, Booz & Company, USA and Middle East\n* Research Staff Member, NEC Labs-Princeton University, NJ, USA\n* Research Staff Member, IBM T. J. Watson, NY, USA\n* Research Staff Member, Intel Corporation, Oregon, USA\n* Currently serves as a Board Member in several Security focus and Machine Learning start-ups\n\n--- \n\nJosé Ignacio LATORRE is a full professor on Theoretical Physics at the Universitat de Barcelona and a long term visinting professor at the Center for Quantum Technologies in Singapore. He is the head of the Quantic research group at the Barcelona Supercomuting Center. He got his PhD in High Energy Physics at the Universitat de Barcelona. He then became a MIT Fulbright Fellow in USA, followed by a postdoc at the Niels Bohr Institutet in Denmark. He has worked on short visits in a large number of universities. He has written over 120 research papers in international journals on Quantum Physics, and on applications of neural networks to high energy data. He founded the Centro de Ciencias de Benasque Pedro Pascual, that he directs. He has produced two documentaries, one of them with the last voice of the Manhattan Project by Roy Glauber. He founded Qilimanjaro Quantum Tech SL and is a partner of Entanglement Partners SL. He produces wine for fun."
