title: 'YOW! 2012 Don Reinertsen - The Practical Science of Batch Size'
language: English
recordingDate: 1513951700
description: "Of all the ideas of Lean, batch size reduction is the most important economically. Yet, few product developers understand it. Manufacturers handle physical objects and they can easily see their batch sizes. Developers handle information and batch size is frequently invisible. In fact, 97 percent of product developers have no systematic program to reduce batch size. In this keynote Don Reinertsen will discuss why batch size reduction is such an important tool, and how you can approach it with a bit of science. He will show you why popular manufacturing ideas like one-piece flow can make little sense in product development and how to think about the economics of batch size.\n\nDon is the President of Reinertsen & Associates, a consulting firm specialized in the management of product development. He has worked with leading product development organizations for over 3o years, and taught executive courses at Caltech for 14 years. He is the author/co-author of three best-selling books on product development. His latest awarding winning book, The Principles of Product Development Flow: Second Generation Lean Product Development, has been praised as, “… quite simply the most advanced product development book you can buy.”\n\nFor more on YOW!
