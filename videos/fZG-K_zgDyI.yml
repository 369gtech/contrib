description: "Programming languages are an incredibly powerful tool. So powerful that giving end-users access to run them on your production servers is generally seen as dangerously reckless.\n\nWe'll see how the BEAM's preemptive scheduler can be combined with Lua's ability to remove entire facets of its core functionality to create a nearly impenetrable sandbox.\n\nAnd then the war will begin!\n\nAll audience members may participate in a PvP battle royale game during and after the talk using Lua scripts designed to crush other players -- or the server."
