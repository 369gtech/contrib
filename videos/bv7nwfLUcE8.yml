description: "DOES19 Las Vegas — Hear about our digital transformation journey, the challenges, lessons learned and successes. Agile, DevOps and SecOps enabled us to transform an IT culture that valued control & governance over agility, contracts over value, standards over flexibility and safety over failure. By prioritizing efficiency, business requirements and user experience, we now build in automation with business logic and ensure the entire deliverable travels through a holistic build and test process.\n\nHow BMC IT Learned to Reinvent vs Just Run the Business\n\nVinod Cheriyan, Sr. Manager IS&T Data Architecture, BMC Software\nDavid Riggan, VP IS&T, BMC Software \n\nVinod measures and models the current application development, deployment and support processes to determine if the processes meet the organization’s mission and strategies, and if and how well the current IT systems enable and support the processes. As a result, spends a great deal of time working with different PMO, BSA, application teams, infrastructure teams, and operations on how best to adopt DevOps and derive value from current and future technology investments. \n\nVinod believes that, an agile enterprise is one that reflects agile and lean values and principles. Agile development practices have been so successful at connecting the once isolated developer to their business user. DevOps extends the gains made with meeting business users' needs to operations' needs. The ultimate goal in this role is to provide perfect value to the customer through a perfect value creation process (Lean) that has zero waste.\n\nDavid Riggan is an accomplished IT Executive with 20+ years of global experience leveraging information technology to rapidly deliver business value. He has experience with a broad range of disciplines including Business Architecture, Portfolio Management, Analytic and Data Strategies, general strategy development, investment strategy, Lean/Agile, offshore development, vendor management and process re-engineering.\n\nDavid is always asking how to improve \"Time to Value\" and then continuously executing, measuring and adjusting. David asks, how can we make the whole greater than the sum of the parts? Where is the non-value add work and how can we remove it? \n\nDOES19 Las Vegas\nDOES 2019 US\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
