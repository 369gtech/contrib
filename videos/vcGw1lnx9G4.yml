description: 'Ever lose out on a good night''s rest because your pesky cats keep waking you up at 4am for food? Rachel has. Many times. For her first project using node, socket.io, microcontrollers, and johnny-five, Rachel built a web-based feeder that delivers tasty cat chow on a configurable schedule or when triggered remotely. She''ll walk you through her learning process with utilizing new tech for the first time and get you excited about trying your own projects so you can take the first steps to putting your work out and contributing to the open source community.'
