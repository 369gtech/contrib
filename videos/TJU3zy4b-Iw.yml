description: 'GraalVM''s Substrate VM is a framework for ahead-of-time compilation of Java applications and smooth interaction with C-like data structures. It brings together the benefits of Java language with behavior of native programs. It offers smooth C-interop API for accessing and calling native OS functionality. The above combined with automatic memory management of Java objects make it a perfect fit for writing reliable, fast startup, low memory consumption applications. Let''s see how easy it is to convert your Java applications to native! Let''s explore how to use such binaries in the cloud containers. Let''s investigate the C-interop API. Let''s find out how to use Java where low level languages like C or Go were needed. Let''s make Java a Universal language!'
