description: "As our industry matures, there is an increasing demand for high-throughput, low-latency systems heavily utilizing event-driven programming and asynchronous processing. This trend is rapidly converging on the somewhat well-established but so far not well-understood term \"reactive.\" This session explores how Java EE as a whole aligns with this movement via features and APIs such as JMS, MDB, EJB @Asynchronous, JAX-RS/Servlet/WebSocket async, CDI events, and Concurrency Utilities for Java EE. We will also see how these robust facilities can be made digestible even in the most complex cases for mere mortal developers through Java SE 8 Lambdas and Completable Futures.\n\nSpeaker:\nReza Rahman, Java EE Evangelist, Oracle\nReza Rahman is a long time former independent consultant and now officially a Java EE evangelist at Oracle. He is the author of the popular book EJB 3 in Action. Reza is a frequent speaker at Java User Groups and conferences worldwide including JavaOne and Devoxx. He is the content chair for the Java EE track at JavaOne and a JavaOne Rock Star award winner. He is an avid contributor to industry journals like JavaLobby/DZone and TheServerSide. Reza has been a member of the Java EE, EJB and JMS expert groups. He implemented the EJB container for the Resin open source Java EE application server. Reza has over a decade of experience with technology leadership, enterprise architecture, application development and consulting. He has been working with the standard Java EE platform since its inception. Reza has developed enterprise systems for well-known companies like eBay, Motorola, Comcast, Nokia, Prudential, Guardian Life, USAA, Independence Blue Cross and AAA using EJB 2, EJB 3, CDI, Spring and Seam."
