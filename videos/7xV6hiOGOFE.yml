description: "This video was recorded at the Erlang User Conference in 2012. For more info and slides, visite the website: http://www.erlang-factory.com/conference/ErlangUserConference2012/speakers/GordonGuthrie\n\nThanks to the miracle of Twilio API's Erlang web developers can now recreate the golden days of Erlang, but in the browser.\n\nYou too can experience the thrill of building conference calls and answer phones, inbound/outbound blended call centres. Amaze yer pals with whisper and pop!\n\nCombining Scottish sweary slang with German and Spanish robot voices is pretty much the best legal fun to be had on the interwebs. Combining that with the adrenaline buzz of a live demonstration, this session will be the only one at EUC with the thrill-o-meter cranked all the way up to 111."
