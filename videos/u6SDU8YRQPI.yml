description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2016\n—\nRemoving a feature from a programming language can be difficult. The amount of code that will no longer compile is always weighed against whether the language provides a better alternative with an easy migration path. For the next C++ standard, quite a few features have been removed or deprecated. From auto_ptr and binary_function to register and trigraphs, this talk will present the motivation for removing and deprecating features in C++ as well as the alternatives that may be used.\n— \nBilly Baker\nFlightSafety International\nSenior Staff Engineer\nBroken Arrow, OK\nBilly Baker has developed deterministic real-time flight simulation software using C++ for FlightSafety International, Evans and Sutherland and Boeing since 1997. At C++ committee meetings, he can most likely be found in LWG. He received his B.S. and M.S in Applied Mathematics from the University of Tulsa and is currently working on a Ph.D. in Computer Science. If asked, he will tell stories from his research semester at NCSA when web browsers did not yet have forms support.Website: http://www.flightsafety.com\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
