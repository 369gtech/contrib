This talk will show you how to optimize network requests to minimize round trips without slowing down critical data paths. We will cover rarely-used but widely supported features to efficiently load data to give your app the fastest possible rendering times.\n\nThis talk will answer the following questions:\n- GraphQL can be used to minimize request round trips.\n- Batched data transfer will be slowed down by the slowest data that is requested\n- We can combine batched data transfer with streaming responses to get the best of both worlds (even in legacy browsers) without the overhead of managing socket connections.\n\n\nmore:\n- https://graphql.org/ A query language for your API\n- Explore together with Rob how to optimize a conference app thanks to GraphQL.\_\n- specification: https://graphql.github.io/graphql-spec/\n-  optimize page loads with @defer and Apollo Server: https://blog.apollographql.com/introducing-defer-in-apollo-server-f6797c4e9d6e\n- Code to fetch and parse MultiPart HTML Response https://github.com/relay-tools/fetch-multipart-graphql\n- Laney Kuenzel & Lee Byron - GraphQL Future at react-europe 2016 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViXL0YQnioU\n\n\nRob (@rob_richard) is a Front-End Engineering director at 1stdibs, a marketplace for rare and desirable goods, where he led the adoption of React, GraphQL, and Relay.\n\n\nSign up for our Newsletter to receive preview-links every other Thursday starting 2019, April 04: https://js-kongress.us13.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=9c3420f6b5269855b07422fb5&id=f490a69da5"
