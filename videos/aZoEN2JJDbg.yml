language: English
recordingDate: 1433517154
description: "People counters are being strategically deployed in retail as a key intelligence-gathering tool for monitoring people traffic and quantifying sales conversion rates.  These same intelligent sensors are also leveraged in the transportation market, where they are installed on board public vehicles to monitor the occupancy levels in real time, with the goal of improving customer satisfaction and gathering critical data for route optimizations. This session presents two real-world case studies in which Java and OSGi technologies running on embedded edge computers are employed to drive and manage people counter devices. It also illustrates how these technologies offer a great foundation for remotely managing always-connected M2M edge computers.\n\n\nAuthors:\nMarco Carrer\nMarco Carrer joined EUROTECH as Chief of Software Engineering after a successful 15-year career in the software industry.
