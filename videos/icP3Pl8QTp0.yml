title: 'YOW! Lambda Jam 2018 -  Jed Wesley-Smith & Mark Hibberd Interview'
recordingDate: 1555569319
description: "Jed Wesley-Smith is a programming philosopher, concerned with how software behaves, scales and composes. He has been a functional programmer for the last 10 years, having discovered FP as a technique to simplify intractable concurrency problems, and then became such an enthusiastic proponent he was nicknamed Captain Immutable at Atlassian. Jed is currently Director of Engineering at Simple Machines, is a YOW! Evangelist, as well as a co-organiser of the FP-Syd and ScalaSyd user-groups.\n\nMark Hibberd spends his time working on data and sustainability problems for Kinesis. Mark takes software development seriously. Valuing correctness and reliability, he is constantly looking to learn tools and techniques to support these goals. This approach has led to a history of building teams that utilise purely -functional programming techniques to help deliver robust products.\n\nFor more information on YOW!
