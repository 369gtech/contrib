description: "2018 has been an eventful year for AI to say the least! We've seen advances in generative models, the AlphaGo victory, several data breach scandals, and so much more. I'm going to briefly review AI in 2018 before giving 10 predictions on where the space is going in 2019. Prepare yourself, my predictions range from more Kubernetes infused ML pipelines to the first business use case of generative modeling of 3D worlds. Happy New Year and enjoy! \n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/kubernetes \n\nPlease Subscribe! And Like. And comment. Thats what keeps me going.\n\nWant more education?
