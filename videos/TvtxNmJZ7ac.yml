description: "A New Way of Deploying .Net Applications at Nasdaq - Bhavani Yellapragada, Nasdaq & Madhav Sathe, Pivotal\n\nNasdaq adopted PCF to start the modernization journey, starting with a legacy .Net application, in order to achieve business agility and velocity. Prior to adoption of PCF and Concourse, Nasdaq relied on home-grown solutions for OS and configuration management using diverse technologies such as Terraform, Puppet, DSC, WSUS and Ansible. This added extra burden on operations team to maintain the automation scripts and manage the technology sprawl. The ticket based systems slowed down Nasdaq’s development teams. And yet there was always a challenge with snowflake configurations. Furthermore, the OS upgrade required every month meant downtime for application.\nIn this session hear Nasdaq’s journey of cultural change along with the adoption of the platform as a product approach. Operators will learn best practices regarding use of Powershell and Concourse for automating platform installation and patching, use of isolation segments and CredHub to address InfoSec needs. Learn lessons on engaging with InfoSec team and help them enhance their checklist for modern cloud native paradigm. Finally, learn how Nasdaq drove real business outcomes by achieving higher business velocity, zero-downtime patching and greater stability.\n\nAbout Bhavani Yellapragada\nNasdaq\n\nAbout Madhav Sathe\nMadhav is a Platform Architect at Pivotal.
