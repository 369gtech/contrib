language: English

description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2017\n—\nOn the surface, function parameter default arguments seem like a very simple feature of the C++ language. This session explores how (not) true that is. If you like the dark corners of C++, you will come away with a new appreciation for this innocent looking syntactic sugar. Otherwise, you will have at least informed yourself on how not to blow your foot off with what looks like a slingshot.\n— \nMichael Price: Synopsys, Inc., Senior Software Engineer\n\nMichael Price has developed and taught C++ for more than a decade and has been an active participant in WG21 since 2014, allocating most of his committee-time to EWG and the Reflection Study Group. He professes interest in making C++ \"safer\" to use through language and library design, automation, testing, and education. His past work includes enterprise-grade screen sharing applications, ABI-safe C++ component design, network protocol design, software development utilities, large-scale build and test automation, C/C++ compiler front-end development for static analysis tools, and a smidge of management experience.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
