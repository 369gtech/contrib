description: "Convolutional neural networks? Stochastic gradient descent? Multivariate linear regression?\n\nMachine learning is a big buzzphrase that contains many big buzzwords that distract from how simple models can be very useful in many different fields, and even put people off from trying to learn the basics.\n\nThis talk will address those two points, explaining what machine learning is really about, what a simple model looks like, and how you can get started with using them.\n\nKrishan Bhasin \nStudied mechanical engineering. Started building things in the cloud. Currently trying to predict things with data."
