title: 'Wix Engineering Podcast, episode 09: The Race for Black Friday'
language: English
recordingDate: 1611149678
description: "For consumers, Black Friday is a convenient time to get a good deal. For developers, it is a tsunami ready to take down everything in its path. \n \nEvery year, on the Friday after Thanksgiving, traffic to online shopping sites spikes three, four, five times over. Websites built to accommodate a certain amount of demand can easily be overwhelmed by a stampede of customers they donâ€™t see at any other time of the year. How, then, is it possible to avoid system breakdowns? \n \nJonathan Ginzburg, Head of Production at Wix, has one solution: break them down yourself. \n\nIn this episode, we follow Jonathan, Shahar Zur and Fabio Furiosi as they conduct a multi-continental test of just how far they can push their system in production."
