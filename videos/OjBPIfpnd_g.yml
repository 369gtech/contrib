language: English
recordingDate: 1413221147
description: 'Freemium is the way to go for many apps. You need to make a good app for non-paying users, to get good reviews, while at the same time giving customers a good reason to upgrade to the paid version. Philip Bergqvist from the startup Unified Intents tells Martin Omander how they struck this balance.'
