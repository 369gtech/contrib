description: "GoWayFest 4.0, Online â€“ July 11-12, 2020\n\nInfrastructure for ML Applications, Natalie Pistunovich\n\nTensorFlow 2.0 is the new version of the end-to-end open source platform for Machine Learning, where researchers can push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers can build and deploy ML and AI powered intermediate applications.\n\nBut the ML code, that is at the heart of an ML system in production, usually accounts for a few percents of the entire codebase. In this talk, Natalie will share from her experience the infrastructure side of things, and will discuss considerations in preparing the infrastructure for an ML training, real time and offline, and present a walkthrough using a production example."
