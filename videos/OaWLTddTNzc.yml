title: 'Stephen Roe - Why raku? The Physics::Unit edge.'
language: English
recordingDate: 1593111981
description: "As raku matures, we need useful basic eco-system modules to bring the unique strengths and cultural style of raku to the wider world. Imagine a universal library of extensible raku classes spanning the sciences - Physics, Chemistry, Bio-sciences, Economics, Maths, Ecology, Virology. For this vision to be possible, one core tool is a standard module to represent real world measurements of values and units.\n\nPhysics::Unit and its sister Physics::Measure, combine the unique capabilities of raku to build on the popularity of this perl5 module in a newly released raku native rewrite. This talk is in two parts (i) highlighting the usefulness of rakuâ€™s unique combination of capabilities - Grammars, Unicode, Rats, infix/postfix operators, Types, OO - all had a place in the implementation and (ii) showcasing how these modules can be used as a natural extension for scientists or engineers at any skill level.\n\nUnlike any other Units module, raku makes it possible to apply Units for the full range of use cases - source code examples and demonstrations will cover embedded postfix units, unit conversion, unit math, unit / object geometry in Jupyter notebooks. With support for US, Imperial and SI units covering base units, derived units and user defined units and parsing."
