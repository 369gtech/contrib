description: "Video with transcript included: https://bit.ly/2ZAyNum\n\nTim Berglund covers Kafka's distributed system fundamentals: the role of the Controller, the mechanics of leader election, the role of Zookeeper today and in the future. He looks at how read and write consistency work, how they are tunable, and how recent innovations like exactly-once semantics and observer replicas work.\n\nThis presentation was recorded at QCon London 2020: http://bit.ly/2VfRldq\n \nFor more awesome presentations on innovator and early adopter topics check InfoQâ€™s selection of talks from conferences worldwide https://bit.ly/2tm9loz\n\n#ApacheKafka #DistributedSystems #SoftwareArchitecture"
