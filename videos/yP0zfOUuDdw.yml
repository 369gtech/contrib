description: "\"Bringing your Python script to more users!\nEuroPython 2020 - Talk - 2020-07-23 - Ni\nOnline\n\nBy Takuya Futatsugi\n\nIt is wonderful to automate boring stuffs with Python.\nIn Japan, new introductory books are being published every month and more and more Pythonistas are working on automation.\nA Python script that is useful to you may be useful to others.\nSo I talk about how to enable others to use your script.\n\nIn this talk, I use a simple script which can reduce the width and the height of a specified image in your computer.\nI assume someone who's read the introductory book can understand the script.\n\nFirst, I introduce Command Line Interface (CLI) to solve hardcoding in the sample script.\nAfter implementing CLI, you don't need to edit the script.\nSecond, I introduce Grafical User Interface (GUI) to make the script more user-friendly.\nFinally, I introduce web application so that users can the script without installation. All users have to do is connecting the Internet!\n\nThe timeline is supposed to be the following:\n\nh1Introduction (3min)/h1\n\n\nself-introduction\nmotivation of this talk\nsample script (pathlib, Pillow)\n\n\nh1CLI (5min)/h1\n\n\nproblem: need to edit the script\nintroduce argparse module (pass target file path from command line)\nabout positional arguments and optional arguments\ncheck whether a path points an existing file (type parameter of add_argument())\n\n\nh1GUI (9min)/h1\n\n\nproblem: CLI is not easy to handle than GUI\nintroduce eel\neel's elements: HTML, CSS, JavaScript\nhello world in eel\nfile access in eel app\nconvert sample script to eel app (user can see which image is specified as targetðŸ˜ƒ)\nhow to distribute\n\n\nh1Web app (9min)/h1\n\n\nproblem: Users need to install\nintroduce Web app\nserver / client\nactually eel's elements are used in web app (we can recycle codes)\nintroduce Flask\nhello world in flask\nstatic files in web app\nhow to deploy (heroku)\n\n\nh1wrap up (1min)/h1\n\nh1Q&amp;A (3min)/h1\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2020.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/\n\n    \""
