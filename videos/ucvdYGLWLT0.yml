language: English
recordingDate: 1433504944
description: "JavaFX offers a wide range of default controls for creating cool and great applications, from business to entertainment use cases. Because JavaFX is a multiplatform UI framework that can be used mainly on desktop-based platforms and embedded devices, a cross-platform skin named Caspian is provided by JavaFX. As of Java 8, Modena will be a official second cross-platform skin for JavaFX, but some applications and developers have a definite need for native or custom skins for their controls and applications. This session points out how to create custom skins for JavaFX controls. You will learn that with AquaFX, this custom skin can even feel like a native one.\n\n\nAuthors:\nClaudine Zillmann\nClaudine Zillmann is a software engineer at SICSone GmbH in Dortmund, Germany.
