description: "Europe’s Leading Laravel Conference\nBlind-bird Tickets 2020 Available\nhttps://laracon.eu/2020/tickets\n\nYou’ve probably heard about XSS, SQL Injection, and RCE. Very few developers out there have actually witnessed first-hand what exploiting any of the mentioned vulnerabilities looks like, and therefor don’t necessarily understand the consequences that having such vulnerabilities in your application can have. In this talk we’ll exploit some commonly known vulnerabilities and misconfigurations that can occur to a Laravel application running on a Linux based host. By learning to think like a hacker you’ll be able to develop more secure applications with Laravel, and to keep yourself, your clients, and your users data safe."
