title: 'Securing Spring Functions By Breaking In'
language: English
recordingDate: 1538632949
description: "Serverless Spring Functions rock the security boat. The fact we dont need to manage servers or capacity rids us of certain security concerns, while the sheer number of functions and the security management they need raises others. In this talk, well experience these security concerns live. Well break into a vulnerable Spring Cloud Functions application and exploit multiple weaknesses. For each, well explain the mistakes that led to them, their implications, and how you can avoid making the same mistakes yourself.\n\nSpeakers:\nGuy Podjarny\nCEO, Snyk\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
