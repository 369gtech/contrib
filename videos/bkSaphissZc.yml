description: "From the 2014 Solid Conference: The digital revolution is over. The bits won and have invaded every aspect of our life, changing the essence of how we live, work, and play. Information is no longer confined to the pixels on our screens. Instead the entire physical world, even living and breathing matter, are being infused with data and code demanding new, unprecedented forms of interactivity.\n\nIn this talk, Ivan Poupyrev argues that the success of this brave new world where real and virtual is seamlessly merged will depend on inventing technologies and designs that can add intuitive, fluid interactivity to the world on a very large scale. Ivan presents his recent research in this direction including sensing and actuation, visual and tactile, energy harvesting and and the fine art of growing digital plants. Although everything he develops has immediate applications in the world of today, it is the dream of a better and brighter tomorrow, a \"conditional optimism\" for the human race as emphasized once by Walt Disney, which drives his work.\n\nAbout Ivan Poupyrev (Google):\nDr. Ivan Poupyrev is an award-winning scientist, inventor and designer who is creating cutting edge interactive technologies blending digital and physical realities. Ivan is currently Technical Program Lead at Google ATAP division. Prior to Motorola he was at Walt Disney Imagineering and Sony CSL in Tokyo. He also did a stint at the Human Interface Technology Laboratory at the University of Washington as a Visiting Scientist and taught at Princeton University School of Architecture as a Visiting Lecturer.\n\nHis research focuses on inventing new technologies and interaction paradigms that seamlessly blend digital and physical interactivity in devices, everyday objects, and living environments on a large scale. It spans a broad range of topics including virtual and augmented reality, haptics, sensing and actuation, interactive biological matter, energy harvesting, 3D printing and additive manufacturing and more. The results of his work have been presented at major international scientific conferences and was broadly reported in popular media including BBC, CNN, New York Times, Wired, New Scientist, The Washington Post, Forbes, Time, MIT Technology Review to name a few. His research was released on the market in a variety of products worldwide and received numerous awards including the Nokia Ubimedia Award, Honorable Mention at ARS Prix Electronica and nomination for National Design Award by Smithsonian Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum. Forrester Media featured him as one of the leading Digital Disruptors in 2013 and Fast Company Magazine recognized him as one of the World's 100 Most Creative People of 2013.\n\nFor more information on the Solid Conference, visit http://solidcon.com.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to O'Reilly to get SolidCon videos as they release: http://goo.gl/szEauh\nStay Connected to O'Reilly Media by Email - http://goo.gl/YZSWbO\n\nFollow O'Reilly Media:\nhttp://plus.google.com/+oreillymedia\nhttps://www.facebook.com/OReilly\nhttps://twitter.com/OReillyMedia"
