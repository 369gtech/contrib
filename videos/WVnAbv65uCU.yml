description: "Stephane Maldini, Project Reactor Lead, Pivotal\nBen Hale, Lead, Cloud Foundry Java Experience, Pivotal Software, Inc.\n\nAs more applications are experiencing the benefits of using a reactive programming model, one of the biggest problems they experience is the mismatch between Reactive Streams backpressure and current networking protocols. Most existing network protocols don’t support the key Reactive Streams concept of pull-push backpressure. Even newer protocols such as HTTP/2 do flow control only at the packet level and provide no way to slow down production on the publisher side of a connection. This session explores how to create a fully reactive multiservice architecture utilizing the RSocket protocol. It shows integration with Spring and how it can be used in ways familiar to longtime Spring developers."
