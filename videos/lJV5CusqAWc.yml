title: 'Driving the Data Pipelines for Connected Vehicles with Spring Cloud Data Flow'
language: English
recordingDate: 1632325253
description: "A data pipeline is a set of actions that ingest raw data from disparate sources and move the data to a destination for storage and analysis. \n As autonomous vehicle technologies continue to evolve, the data generated inside the vehicle only continues to grow exponentially. All of this data needs to be streamed, processed, stored, and analyzed in real time, offline at control centers, or by the auto company for quality improvements.\n \n The need for data pipeline toolchains has led to vendors offering commercial versions that are either proprietary or complicated, leading to vendor lock-in. More importantly, these commercial products have a difficult time keeping up with technology changes, resulting in their products becoming obsolete even before they hit production. Enter Spring Cloud Data Flow (SCDF).\n \n In this session, we'll explore one such implementation in the auto industry that deals with collision assistance. We'll show you how we implemented this solution and walk you through a demo.\n\nBanu Parasuraman, Chief Technologist at Wipro\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/driving-the-data-pipelines-for-connected-vehicles-with-spring-cloud-data-flow"
