description: "Наша группа в ФБ: https://www.facebook.com/qafest/\nНаш сайт: www.qafest.com\n\nДоклад на конференции QA Fest 2017 в Киеве.\nYou might wonder why this title? Because the word manage comes from the Italian maneggiare (to handle, especially tools or a horse) and because if there is a team it does not need to be managed, it needs a goal and support. This talk if for you if are in a “management” or leadership position, if you are working within a team, if you want to work in a team but cannot move on from being a group, if you are working within a team and cannot find your place and especially if you want to have some knowledge in what it takes to create a team."
