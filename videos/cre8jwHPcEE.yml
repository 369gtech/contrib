The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nSIG Cloud Provider Deep Dive - Walter Fender, Google & Yassine Tijani, VMWare \n\nThe long-term goal of SIG Cloud Provider is to promote a vendor-neutral ecosystem for our community. New vendors providing support for Kubernetes should feel equally empowered to do so as any of todayâ€™s existing cloud providers. More importantly, SIG Cloud Provider is focused on ensuring a consistent and high-quality user experience across providers. This deep dive will focus on the efforts to finalize the removal of cloud-specific code from the Kubernetes code base and develop a migration strategy for in-tree to external providers. This session will also cover the evolving SIG governance structure following from the merging of individual cloud provider SIGs as working groups under SIG Cloud Provider, as well as any other major topics raised by the cloud provider community. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Uafo"
