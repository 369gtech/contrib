description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nToolchains Behind Successful Kubernetes Development Workflows - L Körbes, Tilt \n\nKubernetes solved a lot of problems, but it created a clumsy development workflow: Every code change requires fiddling with containers, registries, and manifests. Managing config files isn't trivial. Distributed debugging; a mystery. Dev clusters are tricky to set up, and sharing cluster state among team-members is mostly fiction.  L Körbes, an expert in Kubernetes development tooling, outlines successful development workflows in three different settings: a very large enterprise, a small and agile startup, and a popular open source project.  L will share how they set up dev clusters, manage configs, automate the development feedback loop, share context across teams, debug, and, finally, deploy to production.  Learn how these teams made their Kubernetes dev workflows not only seamless, but amazing to use!\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zet3"
