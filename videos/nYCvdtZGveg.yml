description: "This video looks at an algorithm for finding a particular pixel that is the closest or highest.   The idea is to set a \"record\" value and check each and every pixel to see if they beat the record leaving yourself with the \"world record holder\" at the end of the for loops.  This can be used to track the top a person's body or even the tip of a finger rather accurately (but only if the person is pointing the finger up!)\n\nOpen Kinect links:\nhttps://github.com/shiffman/OpenKinect-for-Processing\nhttp://shiffman.net/p5/kinect/\n\nContact: https://twitter.com/shiffman\n\nLearn Processing from scratch:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman/playlists?sort=dd&shelf_id=2&view=50\n\nMore about image processing in Processing:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6YB9x6f23CBftiyx0u_5sO9\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/Qbte/"
