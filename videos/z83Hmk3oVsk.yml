recordingDate: 1485157341
description: "Ephox’s rich text editors, TinyMCE and Textbox.io are two of the most complex and widely used JavaScript applications in the world: around 10 million people use these full-featured textediors every day. Last year, the team at Ephox took on the huge task of porting the 1500 module, shortcut-key driven, keyboard and mouse intensive application from desktop to mobile.\n\nIn this example-packed presentation, we share the experiences of our epic journey, the challenges faced, and the surprises that blindsided us. If you are planning to transition your own application from desktop to mobile, or create a new responsive web app, our 7 UX Secrets may just save you months of effort (and preserve your sanity!).\n\nDr. Anna Harrison is an award winning speaker, author and designer. She currently leads user experience design at Ephox, makers of the world’s most popular Web editing products including Textbox.io and TinyMCE. Anna’s research has been applied by worldwide organisations including Oracle, NICTA, Unisys, IBM’s Tririga and major airports.\n\nDamien Fitzpatrick is Senior Director of Products at Ephox and has 14 years of experience in content management. Damien is responsible for Ephox’s contributions to TinyMCE and the development of Textbox.io, a next generation rich text editor and the first available for mobile devices. Using HTML5 and responsive CSS3 Damien and the Ephox team have overcome the challenge of adapting rich, browser based word processing to mobile devices and introduced new capabilities on the desktop.\n\nFor more on YOW!
