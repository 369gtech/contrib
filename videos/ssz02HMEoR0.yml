description: "Filmed at https://2020.dotswift.io on February 3, 2020 in Paris. More talks on https://dotconferences.com/talks\n\nSwiftUI has become a topic of great interest this year. It really is fantastic. Unfortunately, itâ€™s incomplete at the moment. Ishmael discusses the process of either starting with a new SwiftUI project and adding UIKit to fill in the gaps or starting with an existing UIKit project and augmenting it with SwiftUI."
