description: 'It was almost midnight when I heard my phone ringing. For my clients from the other part of the Globe it was middle of the day. And not a particular good one. Nothing was working for them because of a bug. What bug? Well, a bug which appeared when they tried to use the application with their new file format. Apparently this blocked their entire system. Damn (!!!) (sigh), not much to do at this hour, I thought, let’s wait for the morning to come to have the chance to talk with the development team, hoping that we will still meet our SLAs. Morning came and I called the technical guys. What ?? Only Alex can solve the problem and he is on holiday?? And he is coming back in two weeks??… As you can imagine, there was no happy end. And the company had to pay a lot of money for not respecting our SLAs. Does the story above sound familiar to you? Unfortunately, I am sure that many of you know what I am talking about. In this presentation we will discuss how to measure the cost of owning a software application and how to decrease this cost as much as possible. For measuring how much a software application costs, instead of considering only the purchase price of an object, the complete cost from purchase to disposal have to be summed up. This calculation is called Total Cost of Ownership, abbreviated TCO, and is designed to help in financial decisions by giving a picture of the profitability over time.'
