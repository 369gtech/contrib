It leverages Spring Cloud for microservices and contains best-of-breed JavaScript and CSS libraries for creating your UI. In this session, you’ll learn about what’s new in JHipster. Possible topics include Angular 2, Progressive Web Apps, HTTP/2, JUnit 5 and Spring 5.\n\nMatt Raible is a web developer and Java Champion. He loves to architect and build slick-looking UIs using CSS and JavaScript. When he's not evangelizing Okta and open source, he likes to ski with his family, drive his VWs, and enjoy craft beer."
