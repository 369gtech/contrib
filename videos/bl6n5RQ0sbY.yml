description: "Cloud, Containers, Kubernetes\n\nMicrosoft issued me a Mac when they hired me to help people use Linux on Azure. If this sounds like the beginning of a nerdy joke, it’s because we need to question long-held opinions, let go of deeply-cherished stereotypes, and welcome this new era of open collaboration.\nLet’s take the 10,000 foot tour of today’s cloud, containers, and orchestration landscape before diving into specifics we can use when making calls on microservices, backing data stores, and app decomposition. We’ll talk public cloud, containers, and k8s from the “Open at Microsoft” perspective!\n\nBridget Kromhout is a Principal Cloud Developer Advocate at Microsoft. Her CS degree emphasis was in theory, but she now deals with the concrete (if 'cloud' can be considered tangible). After 15 years as an operations engineer, she traded being on call for being on a plane. A frequent speaker and program committee member for tech conferences, she leads the devopsdays organization globally and the devops community at home in Minneapolis. She podcasts at Arrested DevOps, blogs at bridgetkromhout.com, and is active in a Twitterverse near you.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
