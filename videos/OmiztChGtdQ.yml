Additionally, it will help everyone to establish a reactive mindset, which is definitely the most crucial skill needed for being efficient with RxJS. Together we are going to develop a fully-featured carousel implementation, heavily relying on RxJS. By attending this experience one will boost his knowledge about RxJS and especially establishing a reactive mindset leading to scalable and resilient software design. Paired with lots of live coding attendees will learn how to approach complex scenarios and how to solve them reactively.\n\nJan-Niklas Wortmann - RxJS Core Team | Germany\nJan-Niklas Wortmann is an IT consultant mostly working on Angular projects.
