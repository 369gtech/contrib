title: 'Deploying Software Containers on Heterogeneous IoT Devices'
language: English
recordingDate: 1509726413
description: 'The Internet of Things presents the situation of millions of devices collecting and generating data. Processing all of this in the cloud has a huge overhead in bandwidth and latency. In some cases it even has security implications. Moreover, we are dealing with heterogeneous devices with different hardware characteristics: architecture, CPU/GPU/TPU, sensors and actuactors. In this session we see how Docker can be used to carry out continuous deployment on IoT devices, bring the processing of data closer to the edge in a reliable way, and deal with device heterogeneity.'
