description: "Keynote: Debunking the Myth: Kubernetes Storage is Hard - Saad Ali, Senior Software Engineer, Google \n\nWe often hear “Storage on Kubernetes is hard” or “Don’t deploy stateful applications on Kubernetes!” Is there any truth to these statements? In this talk I separate fact from fiction.\n\nStorage on Kubernetes can mean a lot of things. First I will start by separating three layers: 1) consuming block and file storage from a pod running in Kubernetes, 2) deploying a stateful app (like a database) on Kubernetes using storage and workload primitives, and 3) deploying a software defined storage system on top of Kubernetes to provide block or file storage. Each of these areas has a different set of challenges that are often conflated to make storage on Kubernetes appear much harder than it is.\n\nAfter separating these layers, I will help you understand what the challenges are with each of them, and how you work around them to effectively deploy stateful applications on Kubernetes. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MQhi"
