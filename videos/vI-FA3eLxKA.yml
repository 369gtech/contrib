description: "Blaine Carter\nOracle Developer Advocate for Open Source\nOracle\n\nAre you thinking about modernizing your database development process... someday... maybe? Do you have directories full of .sql files you use to build your application? You know unit tests should be included as part of your build process and you are going to start adding them... maybe next week? If you think modernizing your dev process will be difficult, time-consuming & expensive, you may be surprised at how easy and inexpensive it is to get started. In this session, Blaine will explore the Oracle Developer Cloud Service. He will talk about some of the included tools & explore mixing in additional open source tools to automate building & testing your applications. The sooner you get started, the more it will save you in the long run."
