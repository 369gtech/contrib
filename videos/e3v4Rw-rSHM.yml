title: 'Webinar: Learn how to clean up your cloud-native “DevOps Dumping Ground”'
language: English
recordingDate: 1595013262
description: "As the automation surface area grows to accommodate hundreds of interconnected APIs on the cloud, developers are using their own, home-grown “digital duct tape” to manage a growing “DevOps dumping ground”. For a lot of organizations, home-grown glue logic is inconsistent, not repeatable, and expensive to maintain hundreds of event-based workflows and thousands of combinations. We believe that the answer lies in automation workflows. In particular, workflows-as-code that can be triggered by events. We want to replace engineers’ home-grown digital duct tape with reusable, event-driven workflows. Your infrastructure is more than the lowest-level plumbing that it runs on. Take control of your infrastructure before it takes control of you!\n\nPresenters:\n\nMelissa Sussmann, Product Marketing Lead @Puppet\nKenaz Kwa Principal Product Manager @Puppet"
