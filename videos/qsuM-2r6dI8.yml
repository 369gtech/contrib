title: 'YOW! Conference 2018 - Chris Ford - Functional Composition'
recordingDate: 1549603147
description: "Functional Composition\n\nChris Ford shows how to make music starting with the basic building block of sound, the sine wave, and gradually accumulating abstractions culminating in a canon by Johann Sebastian Bach. Examples live-coded in Clojure.\n\nChris began to make music with code to compensate for his poor piano technique. It was only later that he realised that programming offers deep insight into musical structures. Over the past few years, Chris has given many talks presenting music theory to programming audiences, covering topics including European classical music, complexity theory, jazz, central African polyrhythms and tuning systems.\n\nFor more on YOW!
