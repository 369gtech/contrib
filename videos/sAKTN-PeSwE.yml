recordingDate: 1362004193
description: "http://strataconf.com/\nRecommendation algorithms have long been a valuable component of ecommerce. They drive incremental revenue by helping customers find what they are looking for. But a new shopping service is taking recommendations to the next level. Stitch Fix, with its disruptive business model, is betting big on algorithms, technology, and domain expertise to transform the way we shop. To Stitch Fix, recommendations represent more than incremental revenue; the company has oriented its entire business model around its ability to get relevant merchandise to its customers. They go beyond helping customers find what they are looking for; Stitch Fix helps customers find what is right for them. And, sometimes what's right isn't obvious until the customer has it in her hands.\n\nIn this talk you'll learn how Stitch Fix approaches algorithms, acquires unprecedented data, and fuses analytics with human intuition -- all the necessary ingredients to make this innovative business model work. The talk will inspire those with conceptual or aspirational knowledge of algorithms by showing what is possible. And, it will intrigue the experience data scientist by showing what has been done.\n\nhttp://strataconf.com/strata2013/public/schedule/detail/27190"
