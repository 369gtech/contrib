description: 'Git is a revision control system that is used for many Open Source projects. Having a basic understanding of Git is essential to being able to join an Open Source project and become a contributor. Itâ€™s also super useful for many other activities! This talk will explore the basics of Git, assuming no existing background experience. Via analogies to other, familiar technolgies, the basic principles of using Git will be explained in an approachable, understandable fashion. People who attend this talk should come away ready to make an initial contribution to an Open Source project, and will leave with a list of additional resources to explore to learn more.'
