It provides you with a subset of Python 3 features including numeric types, strings, tuples, lists, dictionaries and classes. Large parts of the Python standard library have also been ported. This session will give an introduction to MicroPython, discuss how it differs from traditional CPython, and how to get up and running with coding yourself.\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
