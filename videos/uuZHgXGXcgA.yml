description: "Do you run a business? Are you a startup? Better yet, is it something you've always wondered how to get started or just genuinely interested in what it takes to run a business?\n\nIn this panel / mixer we're going to gather around the campfire and share our war stories. What did it take to get started. How much money was involved? Did you seek funding, have you gotten paid yet? How in the world do you put food on the table."
