description: "Dean Wampler, principal consultant at Think Big Analytics, shares his thoughts on why \"Big Data\" needs to be Functional at the 2012 Northeast Scala Symposium. Dean examines how OOP and Java thinking is impacting the effectiveness of Hadoop (the current darling of the Big Data world).\n\nUsing Scala examples from tools like Scrunch, Spark, and others, Dean demonstrates why functional programming is the way to improve internal efficiency and developer productivity. Finally, Dean looks at the potential future role for Scala in Big Data.\n\n** Videos sponsored by Typesafe (http://typesafe.com) and Marakana.\n** Head to http://mrkn.co/01lzs for Dean's slides."
