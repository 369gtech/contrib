title: 'ColdFront17 • Peter O''Shaughnessy: The Samsung Internet Story: Why Samsung Made a Web Browser'
recordingDate: 1509353192
description: "As the third most used mobile web browser in Europe according to StatCounter, Samsung Internet is “the biggest browser you’ve probably never heard of!”. This is the story of why we are developing our own browser and contributing into the open source Chromium project. Plus the web technologies we’re most excited about and how we want to help push the web forwards. This talk will reveal the behind-the-scenes history of the browser and what it means for web developers. It will also touch on the wider themes of browser diversity and the rise of the “Chromia” - multiple browsers based on Chromium.\n\nSlides: https://poshaughnessy.github.io/the-samsung-internet-story-coldfront-2017/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/poshaughnessy"
