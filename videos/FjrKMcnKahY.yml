language: English
recordingDate: 1635169498
description: "Let's build our first Android app - a tip calculator! This video assumes NO prior experience with Android, and by the end you'll have something an app you could publish. We'll cover how to create the user interface with XML, and how to code the logic using the Kotlin programming language. These are the fundamental building blocks of any modern Android app. \n\nWe'll use the ConstraintLayout for the layout and two event listeners for the app logic. After you enter a base amount and a tip percentage, the app will calculate the tip and total for you. We also implement a tip percentage animation and a footer to make our app more unique.\n\nâž¤ Learn Kotlin in 12 Minutes: https://youtu.be/iYrgWO2oibY\nâž¤ Learn how to publish your app: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMzQ2vM1S6c\nâž¤ Download this app on Google Play: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rkpandey.tipcalculator\n\nðŸ”— Follow Rahul on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/rpandey1234\nðŸ”— Follow Rahul on Twitter: https://twitter.com/rpandey1234\nðŸ”— Follow Rahul on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/rpandey1234/\n\nðŸŽ‰ Thanks to our Champion and Sponsor supporters:\nðŸ‘¾ Wong Voon jinq\nðŸ‘¾ hexploitation\nðŸ‘¾ Katia Moran\nðŸ‘¾ BlckPhantom\nðŸ‘¾ Nick Raker\nðŸ‘¾ Otis Morgan\nðŸ‘¾ DeezMaster\nðŸ‘¾ AppWrite\n\n--\n\nLearn to code for free and get a developer job: https://www.freecodecamp.org\n\nRead hundreds of articles on programming: https://freecodecamp.org/news\n\nAnd subscribe for new videos on technology every day: https://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=freecodecamp"
