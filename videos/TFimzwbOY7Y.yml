language: English
recordingDate: 1433235236
description: "This session discusses two major topics: the emergence of graphs and graph databases outside of the  classic  social use cases and the factors driving this trend. It draws from open source community projects as well as real-world early commercial adopters in verticals such as finance, telecom, healthcare, and life sciences. You will leave this session with an appreciation for and an understanding of how you can reap the benefits of applying graph technologies beyond managing the social graph.\n\n\nAuthor:\nEmil Eifrem\nEmil is the founder of Neo4j, the most widely deployed graph database on the planet, CEO of its commercial sponsor Neo Technology and a co-author of the O'Reilly book Graph Databases. He plans to save the world with graphs and own Larry's yacht by the end of the decade.
