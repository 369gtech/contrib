description: "Blockchain technology, Deep Learning, and Interplanetary File Systems? How can we merge all this cool new technology to create something useful and beautiful? I'll go over the underlying technologies that can help create decentralized artificial intelligence. I visited Singapore for a short stint recently and gave this talk at a local data science meetup. The crowd was full of energy and excitement. I went ahead and re-uploaded the video they posted to my own channel, since I think you guys could benefit from it as well. Its a 40 minute talk with 5 minute Q&A at the end. \n\nPlease Subscribe! And like. And comment. That's what keeps me going.\n\nWant more education?
