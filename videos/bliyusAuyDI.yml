description: "Professor Mark Gold visited Google LA on May 1, 2015.  He is the former director of Heal the Bay and made a presentation on the current water crisis.\n\nCalifornia is in an unparalleled water crisis.  Not only are we in the 4th year of a drought, but the April 1st Sierra snowpack was a record 5% of normal.  In response to the crisis, cities have been mandated to cut their water use by an average of 25% and agriculture will soon receive massive cutbacks in their water allocations. How will the drought affect you and can you do anything to make a difference?"
