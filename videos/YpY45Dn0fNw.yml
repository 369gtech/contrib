description: "In this talk, we will discuss computer vision, one of the most common real-world applications of machine learning. We will deep dive into various state-of-the-art concepts around building custom image classifiers - application of deep neural networks, specifically convolutional neural networks and transfer learning.\n\nWe will demonstrate how those approaches could be used to create your own image classifier to recognise the characters of \"My Little Pony\" TV Series [or Pokemon, or Superheroes, or your custom images].\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
