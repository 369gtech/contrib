description: "The first core value of the Agile Manifesto is to value individuals and interactions over processes and tools. When speaking to people on various organization levels, you need to be able to interpret and adapt to technical information. The way you would interact with the engineering department differs from how you would present information to the marketing group. The best speakers often use stories as a tool for explaining and bringing to life a key message. It’s one of the best ways to convey your ideas. Even technical presentations can be engaging, entertaining and memorable!\n\nThe talk will be packed with practical examples how to shape your presentation to match your audience.\n\nValdas Maksimavičius\nValdas Maksimavičius – IT Solutions Architect and Team Lead working in a multinational company Cognizant.
