recordingDate: 1492597154
description: "Confused about reactive web applications? Unsure how buzzwords translate into practice? You can come see a Reactive web application built before your eyes, using standard Java 1.8 classes and the Play Framework.\n\nIn this presentation, we will walk you through how to put together a non-blocking, asynchronous, event driven application, using a REST API as an example, showing the some of the \"gotchas\" behind non-blocking APIs, and the best practices to manage them, and the practical differences between small-r \"reactive\" applications and full on microservice architectures.\n\nWill Sargent works on the Play team at Lightbend. He has a background as consultant, trainer, and general technical problem solver with a focus on web applications. He also has a Docker Cheat Sheet that is quite popular, and enjoys playing with odd Java security features."
