description: 'In Chinese philosophy, Yin and Yang represent opposite yet equally necessary elements that work in harmony to maintain balance while bringing about change. In today’s software economy, DevOps represents multiple people in the value delivery chain (Dev, QA, Ops) that work in harmony to maintain balance while bringing about change. But scratching deeper, we find another key harmonic relationship – that of teams, tactics and tools. This session will focus on how ways organizations can empower DevOps teams by providing the necessary support, processes and tools they need to flourish and accelerate the rate of sustainable change they unleash on the world.'
