recordingDate: 1634736561
description: "This talk was presented during the React Native EU 2021 - the largest community conference in the world focused exclusively on React Native.\n\nAbstract: Going from web to mobile? Starting with React Native comes naturally for React developers, but there are some significant differences because mobile development is a totally different adventure. In this talk, I'd like to go over the challenges you'll experience in your journey from React to React Native apps. I'll offer my own experience as a React developer on how to get started building mobile apps and a new perspective showing that the mobile world is quite different from the web. I want to share all the differences, challenges, and advantages to keep in mind when diving into the native apps universe.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\nSoftware Engineer living and working in Serbia. Tech Lead in Badin Soft with experience working on React and React Native apps. Loves teaching and mentoring, and considers it a work of heart. Supporting women who code and inspiring girls in their path to become successful developers.\n\nI have been more active on Instagram where I share my knowledge in React, React Native, and JS generally so here is links for Instagram and Twitter to check it out:  \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/millicode_/ \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/millicode_"
