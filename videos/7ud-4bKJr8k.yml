title: 'Agile Adria 2014 / Vasco Duarte: "How to improve estimates for software: The #NoEstimates view"'
recordingDate: 1400181756
description: "ince 1968 -- the year of the Garmisch conference that originated the \"software crisis\" word -- our industry has been struggling with predictability and estimation. We all know of the horror stories of software project run amok with unbelievable cost and time overruns. Can we do it better? Can we estimate better software projects?\nIn this talk we will review some of the advances in software estimation by such luminaries as Barry Boehm, Caper Jones, Steve McConnel and others and present a different way to look at software projects and estimation specifically.\nWe'll review data from several projects to present an approach that can deliver 4% deviations in schedules and can deliver projects predictably. But there is a catch, we will be looking at something totally different. Bring an open mind...\n\nAbout Vasco\n\nCurrently an Agile Coach at Avira, Vasco Duarte is an experienced Product and Project Manager. Having worked in the software industry since 1997, Vasco has also been an Agile practitioner since 2004, he is one of the leaders and catalysts of Agile methods and Agile culture adoption at Avira and previously at Nokia and F-Secure.\n\nAbout Agile Adria conference\n(agileadria.com)\n\nThis video is recorded at Agile Adria conference.
