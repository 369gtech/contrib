description: "Agile methodologies are associated with change-friendly and results-focused software development, so why keep it only for the developers?\n\nAmong other benefits, company-wide application of Agile practices can help create inter-departmental synergy; centralize organizational strategic objectives and underlying tasks; provide a bird’s-eye view of the strategy execution progress.\n\nThe presentation will share the intermediate results of the solution implemented using a collection of Kanban boards."
