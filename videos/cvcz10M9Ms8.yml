description: "The talk from .NET Fest conference in Kyiv, Ukraine.\nPresentation: http://bit.ly/34tWnrW\nFb: https://www.facebook.com/dotNETFest/\nWebsite: http://dotnetfest.com/\n\nGraphQL is a great way to expose your APIs and it has changed the way we think about consuming data over HTTP. With GraphQL we want to have one schema that provides all the data to us in a consistent way, enabling us to drill into the graph and fetch with one request what we actually want instead of having to issue multiple requests.\nIn the real world, however, we more often build small services that serve certain use cases. Simpler services are easier to maintain and can be deployed more rapidly. Moreover, we often also want to use external services that are not built by us. Ultimately, we will end up with multiple APIs again.\nThe solution for this dilemma is schema stitching. This talk will explore the schema stitching capabilities on ASP.Net Core with Hot Chocolate. We will show how you can set up a Hot Chocolate GraphQL gateway in under 5 minutes and move on to the various stitching scenarios.\nThis talk introduces simple auto-stitching scenarios and goes on to demonstrate how you can rewrite your GraphQL APIs into something truly new."
