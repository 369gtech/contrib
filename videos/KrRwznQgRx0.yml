title: 'Cloud-native Microservices by Timo Derstappen | DevOps Gathering 2018'
recordingDate: 1535528348
description: "https://devops-gathering.io/\n\nThank you bee42 solutions (https://bee42.com/de/) for the great conference!\n\n***********\n\nMicroservice Architectures are around since a while now. There have already been a few generations of tooling and patterns that helped to run and manage them. Timo will show us how a current cloud-native stack looks like and which tools should be on your radar. The talk will cover both operational and architectural topics. As the name cloud-native suggests most of the projects explained in the talk are either already hosted within the cloud-native computing foundation (CNCF) or within the incubation process. Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, Opentracing and GRPC are just a few examples.\n\n\n***********\n\nWanna stay tuned and get our newsletters? Subscribe here: https://devops-gathering.io/"
