description: "Talk recording from Amsterdam JSNation 2019 Conference: https://jsnation.com\n\n# Testing Tools and Their Friends\n\nDay to day I work on Cypress.io open source end-to-end test runner. And I love it - but there are other tools that help me write better tests and better code. In this presentation, I will show some of my favorite tools that complement, extend and supercharge my unit, integration and end-to-end tests."
