description: "A common misconception is that traditional frameworks such as Flask and Django are incompatible with asynchronous web servers. In this talk I'm going to show you how to write an asynchronous web application using Flask.\n\nAsynchronous web servers are hot these days, but to have access to this technology in Python most people will tell you that you need to use one of the new asyncio based web frameworks. Unfortunately none of those frameworks have the robustness, extension ecosystem or developer community of more traditional options such as Flask or Django.\n\nSo here is one of the best kept secrets in the Python world: Did you know that asyncio is not the only way to implement asynchronous servers, and that some of the alternatives to asyncio are fully compatible with your favorite WSGI web frameworks, including Flask, Django and many others?\n\nIn this talk I'm going to show you how to write a fully asynchronous web application using Flask. All the techniques I'll show are also applicable to Django and most other WSGI web frameworks!"
