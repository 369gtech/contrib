description: "Martin Hogg, Oracle\n\nMike Turner, Product Lead, Zenotech Ltd\n\nThe ability to deploy supercomputing workloads on public cloud infrastructure presents a world of opportunities for engineers building complex fluid dynamics, modeling, and simulation applications. This session explains how supercomputing workloads can be rapidly deployed and executed with blistering performance with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and describes how Oracle customers are using it to maximize the efficiency of wind farmsâ€”at a fraction of the cost and complexity of traditional supercomputing applications."
