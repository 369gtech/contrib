description: "A hearing aid allowing someone to hear music for the first time; smart glasses displaying captions enabling a deaf person to enjoy the theater; a remotely assisted blind person walking an unknown busy street; glasses allowing people to perceive colors for the first time. Technology smashes through perceived barriers to participation and enjoyment, and truly enables all. This is equally true in the digital world, where, with the right approach, technology can again break through these barriers. \n\nIn this session, you will learn what the \"right approach\" is on the web, and how APEX can help you work toward this. We will also talk about what \"disability\" really means; how it’s not just about those with obvious disabilities, but either through circumstance or injury, how anyone can face certain limitations or restrictions at some point in their lives, and therefore how thinking inclusively about your design and development can truly benefit everyone. Starting today, let’s all build APEX apps that anyone can use and love!\n\nOracle Application Express (APEX) is a low-code development platform that enables you to build stunning, scalable, secure apps, with world-class features, that can be deployed anywhere.
