Brown\n(Cheriton School of Computer Science, University of Waterloo)\n\nABSTRACT\nHaplotype inference is a field that results from a technological limitation: it is expensive to separate the paternal and maternal chromosomes of an organism. However, being able to do so would be useful, particuarly when one tries to identify genetic variations partly responsible for common diseases. Haplotype inference is the computation problem of inferring these different chromosome sequences, by optimizing some combinatorial or statistical requirement. What makes haplotype inference attractive to computer scientists is that one can very quickly abstract away many..."
