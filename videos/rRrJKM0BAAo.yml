description: "Evolution of Integration and Microservices with Service Mesh and Ballerina - Christian Posta, Red Hat \n\nCloud-native describes a way of building applications on a cloud platform to iteratively discover and deliver business value.

What challenges arise when we start building applications to take advantage of this new technology?   In this talk we'll explore the role of service meshes when building distributed systems, why they make sense, and where they don't make sense.
