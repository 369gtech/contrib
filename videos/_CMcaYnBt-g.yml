description: "A series of lightning demos from Velocity Europe 2014 in Barcelona:\n- Google BigQuery, with HTTP Archive and Google Cloud Dataflow (Ilya Grigorik, Google)\n- OpenSpeedMonitor (Uwe Beßle & Nils Kuhn, iteratec GmbH)\n\nWatch more from Velocity Europe 2014: http://goo.gl/Hl7fvj\nVisit the Velocity website to learn more: http://velocityconf.com/velocityeu2014/\nSubscribe for more from the conference! http://goo.gl/szEauh\n\n\"Uncovering Web Performance Trends with HTTP Archive and Google Cloud Dataflow\" - Ilya Grigorik\n\nHTTP Archive crawls over 300K sites and archives millions of response bodies that are used to construct the page. In this lightning demo we’ll take a look at the performance trends and insights hidden in this data with the help of Google Cloud Dataflow and BigQuery.\n\n\"Webpagetest-automation 2.0 – OpenSpeedMonitor\" - Nils Kuhn and Uwe Beßle\n\nWebPagetest is a great tool for ad hoc measurement and analysis of single web-page performance. Our goal however was a continuous monitoring of web-applications. With WebPagetest-Monitor there is an extension to WebPagetest for this purpose. Unfortunately WebPagetest-Monitor had it’s last release on 2010/12/20 with version 0.3.0. Many new features and metrics from WebPagetest are not supported by the old WebPagetest-Monitor. Therefore we developed a new tool to leverage private webpagetest-infrastructures: OpenSpeedMonitor. In providing the following features it perfectly fits the need for automation of webpagetest and trending its results.\n\nMeasurement-Jobs can be scheduled with cron-like expressions. Thus scheduling is much more flexible than configuration by frequency. You can schedule jobs to only run over the day (omit the nightly maintenance window) or on weekends.\n\nEvery setting of WebPagetest can be configured per job within OpenSpeedMonitor (bandwidth characteristics, capturing a tcpdump, emulate mobile browser etc.). Every result WebPagetest provides OpenSpeedMonitor visualizes in trends over time. Correlations between different kind of measurands, like document complete-time and the bytes loaded until that time, can be represented by a diagram. Additionally, all measured results can be sent to Graphite, to include page performance measurements in central monitoring from OPS.\n\nThe individual pages of a web application typically share some static content. Other content is page-specific. Each web-application has its typical use cases, with sequences of pages typically visited by customers in the same order. Thus, the pageload-behaviour users normally experience differs significantly from measured page load times with both WebPagetests first view as well as the repeated view.\n\nWebPagetest can handle scripts with multiple steps, in order to measure page load times correctly. But the handling of scripts with WebPagetest is cumbersome. With WebPagetest only one measurement can be made per job, containing either the whole script as one measurement or only a certain part of the script. This leads to very inefficient WebPagetest measurements executing scripts with ten steps and only measuring the last page load. Furthermore there is no assistance for editing scripts with the scripting API. In order to measure the impact of the browser cache in correct state we adapted WebPagetest to save and visualize separate results for each single page in the sequence of a script.\nOpenSpeedMonitor provides a Javascript editor to write multistep-scripts. That editor simplifies scripting with syntax-highlighting and code completion for WPT scripting keywords and configured pagenames, validation of script logic and the possibility to parameterize scripts.\n\nOpenSpeedMonitor is free, open source and will be available on github soon.\n\nClick here to learn more about all three presenters: http://goo.gl/Xn4n25\n\nStay Connected to O'Reilly Media by Email - http://goo.gl/YZSWbO\nFollow O'Reilly Media:\nhttp://plus.google.com/+oreillymedia\nhttps://www.facebook.com/OReilly\nhttps://twitter.com/OReillyMedia"
