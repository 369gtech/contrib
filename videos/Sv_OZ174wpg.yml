description: "Google Tech Talks\nJune, 19 2008\n\nABSTRACT\n\nDigital tools for annotation of video have the promise to provide immense value to researchers in disciplines ranging from psychology to computer science to ethnography. With the traditional methods for annotation being cumbersome, time-consuming, and frustrating, technological solutions are situated to aid in video annotation by increasing reliability, repeatability, and workflow optimizations. Three notable limitations of existing video annotation tools are lack of support for the annotation workflow, poor representation of data on a timeline, and poor interaction techniques with video, data, and annotations. Our model is a new system called VCode and VData. The benefit of our system is that is directly addresses the workflow and needs of both researchers and video coders.\n\nSpeaker: Josh Hailpern canditate\nJoshua Hailpern is currently a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in the Computer Science Department focusing on Human Computer Interaction.
