A lot of legacy is thrown out and new mechanisms will replace old flawed ones. Most of the TLS handshake will be encrypted as opposed to earlier when most of the first handshake was in plain text and encryption started first when sending the final handshake confirmation message.  TLS-1.3 also puts new requirements on TLS-1.2  to pave the way for migration. Supervisors, generic behaviours, logger, gb_trees, ets, queue models, maps, try catch, binaries, records how are they used and why.  \n\nSlides & full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/ingela-anderton-andin/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - INGELA ANDERTON ANDIN\nTop female contributor to Erlang/OTP - New SSL/TLS application in OTP  and contributions to AXD 301 and SGSN\n\nComputer science education from Uppsala University worked with Erlang/OTP and its development for almost 20 years.\n\nMore on Ingela Anderton Andin: https://codesync.global/speaker/ingela-anderton-andin/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM SF 2020\nCode BEAM SF is powered by Code Sync.
