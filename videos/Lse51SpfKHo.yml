description: "Spring Framework 5 brings full reactive support to developers everywhere. What better way to demo reactive programming than to actually build something live? Trisha will live code an end-to-end application using Spring Framework 5, Spring Boot, Reactor, Kotlin, JavaFX, and maybe even some MongoDB, all built using IntelliJ IDEA. During this session, weâ€™ll see how these different components can work together really easily using Spring. What could possibly go wrong?\n\nSpeaker: Trisha Gee, Developer Advocate, JetBrains\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2019"
