By understanding what he meant by \"symbolic violence\", \"cultural capital\" \"hexis\" etc, we see how each of us influences and is influenced by the people around us, in ways that we wouldn't expect.  From this talk, a vulgarized and easy to understand version of  Bourdieu's ideas, each of us can seek how to improve the ambience immediately around us\n\nSlides & full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/romeu-moura/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - ROMEU MOURA\nOne must imagine sisyphus happy\n\nEndless conversation — with friends, compilers — on art, Symmathesy, methods, absurdism, dialectic, paradigm jumps, serendipity.\n\nMore on Romeu Moura: https://codesync.global/speaker/romeu-moura/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE MESH LDN 19\nCode Mesh LDN is powered by Code Sync.
