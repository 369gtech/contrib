description: "Meetup #AperiTech della Community di Angular Roma\n\nManfred Steyer - Micro Frontends and Monorepos: Smart Idea or Contradiction?\n\nMicro Frontends \"by the book\" are managed in different repositories. However, many Angular developers value the comfort and features provided by monorepos.\nWith an example built with Nx and Module Federation, this session shows how to combine these two concepts and set out the consequences of this strategy. We discuss sharing libraries between separately deployed micro frontends, enforcing isolation between micro frontends and deployment strategies.\nBy the end, you know how to build micro frontends with Nx and Module Federation and what you should take care of.\n\n\nPer restare aggiornato su tutti gli #AperiTech:\nTelegram #AperiTech https://t.me/aperitech\nCalendario del Developer https://bit.ly/devcalendar\nCodemotion Tech Community https://bit.ly/CodemotionTC"
