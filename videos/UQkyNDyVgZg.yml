language: English
recordingDate: 1463780031
description: "Dan Lyons is a veteran technology journalist who worked at Forbes and Newsweek. He was the voice behind Fake Steve Jobs, and The Secret Diary of Steve Jobs, and later worked on two seasons of Silicon Valley, the HBO comedy. His new book, Disrupted: My Misadventure in the Start-Up Bubble, is a New York Times Best Seller and a hilarious chronicle of his mishaps trying to fit in as the \"old guy\" at a software startup where he was twice the age of everyone else. It's a funny book but Dan also takes a serious look at the dysfunctional culture of startups and in Silicon Valley in general. In a conversation with Chris DiBona, Dan talks about the ideas he explores in \"Disrupted.\" He also talks about how he ended up working on \"Silicon Valley,\" and what it was like working in the room with a team that included former Twitter CEO Dick Costolo. \n\nSee all the talks from Google I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/olw6kV\nWatch more Android talks at I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/Uv3jls\nWatch more Chrome talks at I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/JoMLpB\nWatch more Firebase talks at I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/JTH9Fr \nSubscribe to the Google Developers Channel: http://goo.gl/mQyv5L \n\n#io16 #GoogleIO #GoogleIO2016"
