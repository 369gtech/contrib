title: 'GopherCon 2021: Tom Miller - Northwestern''s Data Science Program Features Go'
language: English
recordingDate: 1640048361
description: 'If Go is good enough for Google, Netflix, Uber, Dropbox, PayPal, American Express, Salesforce, and others, then Go is good enough for all organizations. If Go can provide an effective platform for building Docker, Kubernetes, Prometheus, Pachyderm, Dgraph, CockroachDB, and various cloud-native microservices, then Go can be an effective platform for building data science applications. It does not take long to find examples of benchmarks demonstrating the advantages of Go over Python and R. At Northwestern, they have taken this to heart and they now have three featured languages in data science: Python, R, and Go.'
