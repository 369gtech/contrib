This can lead to poor customer experience and/or failed transactions during checkout. Because of Walmart's scale of serving around 265 million customer every week, the comnbined effect on customer experience as well as the loss of revenue is pretty huge.  To overcome the issue between Stores and cloud, Walmart is building and rolling out the next generation of Point of Sale (POS) systems on highly resource constraint edge computing environment using modern service mesh based technologies designed to allow maximum business flexibility, extreme performance and rapid deployment and powered by Kubernetes. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UdJf"
