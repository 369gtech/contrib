recordingDate: 1581969605
description: "The Journalists of the ICIJ used graph technology to understand the relationships between the leaked pieces of information in the Panama and Paradise Papers.\n\nNBC News applied graph algorithms to the messages and follower networks of Russian Twitter trolls to gain further insights.\n\nThe Trumpworld organizational data correlated with US bills and government contracts offers starting points for further investigations.\n\nNew tools like graph databases allow data journalists to understand the intricate networks of the criminal, economic and political world better as those three examples show. Each journalist adding new connections helps others to validate their stories. They say \"It's like magic\".\n\nJoin Michael for a look behind the scenes of graph based data ingestion, analysis and investigation.\n\nWe will use the open source graph database Neo4j, data visualization and graph algorithms to read between the lines.\n\nchael has been passionate about software development for a very long time. For the last few years he has been working on the open source Neo4j graph database filling many roles.\n\nAs caretaker of the Neo4j community and ecosystem he especially loves to work with graph-related projects, users and contributors. As a developer, Michael enjoys many aspects of programming languages, learning new things every day, participating in exciting and ambitious open source projects and contributing and writing software related books and articles.\n\nFor more on YOW!
