recordingDate: 1476980314
description: "A Google TechTalk, June 28, 2016, presented by Antonello Scardicchio (ICTP)\nABSTRACT:  I will report on our work aimed at understanding the properties of the quantum spin glass transition (at zero temperature) of the Ising spin glass with transverse field.  We have performed a Montecarlo study of the properties of such transition, including the entanglement entropies and scaling of gaps. I will present a phenomenology of the transition which accounts for these observations and suggests an attack line for similar models arising from combinatorial optimization problems solved with the adiabatic algorithm. I will also comment on the connections of this phase transition with the many-body localization transition, if this occurs at lower values of the transverse field.\n\nPresented at the Adiabatic Quantum Computing Conference, June 26-29, 2016, at Google's Los Angeles office."
