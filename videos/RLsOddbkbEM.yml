description: "Google Code Jam is back this year for their 10th anniversary! Mark your calendar - the Qualification Round will start on Friday, April 12, 2013.\n\nTen years after its inception, Code Jam continues to bring together professional and student programmers from all over the world to solve tough algorithmic puzzles. Last year over 35,000 coders competed, but it was Poland's Jakub Pachocki (meret) who earned the title of Code Jam Champion, and the $10,000 reward.\n\nThe competition consists of four online rounds, culminating in the world finals held at Google's office in London, United Kingdom this August. The winner of Code Jam 2013 will walk away with a $15,000 prize, the coveted title of Code Jam Champion, and automatic qualification in the Code Jam 2014 finals to defend his or her title.\n\nJoining us today are Bartholomew Furrow and Igor Naverniouk from the Code Jam engineering team. Besides the fact that the Code Jam problems are fun to solve, it is also a great way to brush up on your programming skills for future job interviews. Please use the Google Moderator series below to post questions in advance about Code Jam."
