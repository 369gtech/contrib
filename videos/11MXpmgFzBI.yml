description: 'Modern web-scale applications place exacting demands on data for speed and latency. These demands are difficult to satisfy with heritage SQL data systems, which were never designed for modern applications or deployment mechanisms like containers. On top of that, the need for SQL-like consistency and transaction integrity remains. Is it possible for a database to reconcile all of these competing requirements? In this session we will go through different use cases where Tanzu GemFire can provide value to the customer and outcomes it drives. We will also go through the high-level overview of the product.'
