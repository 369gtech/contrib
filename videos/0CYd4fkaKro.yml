recordingDate: 1465295294
description: 'Coming from a strong psychological background, I was immersed into the world of software development. With no technical background nor prior experience, I was slowly discovering that those two worlds, that seemed to be so far from each other, are after all very connected. I would like to guide you through my journey and put on psychologist’s glasses for a while. Together we’ll look into Agile world from a different perspective.'
