The initiative fosters cross-community collaboration and includes contributors from FD.io CSIT, Network Service Mesh and OpenStack among others. This intro + deep dive session will walk through how users can provision the hardware and cluster infrastructure on Packet bare-metal machines as well as the deployment of various telecom-focused use cases onto those clusters. There will be time for Q/A as well as looking at the implementation for some components of the CNF Testbed. Attendees should leave this session with an understanding of how to deploy the CNF Testbed with their own Packet accounts and to contribute to the CNF Testbed initiative. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UakA"
