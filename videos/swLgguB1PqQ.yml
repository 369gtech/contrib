title: 'Deploy to any Cloud Foundry target with eXo Cloud IDE'
recordingDate: 1322520315
description: 'As the first open platform as a service, Cloud Foundry was created with the idea that developers should have maximum freedom of choice: in frameworks, application services and deployment clouds. By open-sourcing the code, a rich ecosystem of third-party providers has grown around the Cloud Foundry project. The latest development to that end is the availability of the eXo Cloud IDE with support for Cloud Foundry deployments and Micro Cloud Foundry'
