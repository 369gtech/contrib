description: "Disrupting the Undisruptable: The UX of Emerging Tech in a Large Corporate\n\nIn 2017, you saw the leaps made by machines that can think, adapt and learn to perform tasks better than any human ever can. But what does any of this mean for you, your industry and the field of UX? In the last UX Conference, Onwah called out the responsibility of the UX sector for ensuring it participates in the development of new and emerging technologies. Since then, he has been leading the work at LexisNexis on the practical application of cutting edge technologies to create new and engaging experiences in a sector that isn’t familiar with disruptive tech. Find out how he overcame corporate traditions, industry attitude and technology hurdles and took an idea from concept to customers in weeks rather than years.\n\nAbout the speaker: \nOnwah Tsang http://twitter.com/thisisready – Specialist in technology strategy and delivery. Currently Head of Tax Workflow at LexisNexis. Previously Technical Project Manager at BBC\n\nAbout the conference:\nAt The UX Conference on February 20th 2018 in London we were exploring how to improve collaboration between designers and business stakeholders.
