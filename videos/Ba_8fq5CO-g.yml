description: "Google TechTalks\nAugust 9, 2006\n\nDr. Roger Stettner\nSteve Silverman\nNoel Gorelick\n\nABSTRACT\nAdvanced Scientific Concepts has developed a 3D camera unlike any other in existence. At video frame rates (30Hz) their solid-state flash LADAR system is able to simultaneously measure the distance to every point in the scene by recording the time-of-flight of a laser pulse. At full speed the camera collects 500,000 range points per second using a 1.57um eye-safe laser that has been successfully tested at distances greater than 5km.The entire system is the size of a shoebox and weighs only 12 pounds. It uses less than 60 watts of power and can be controlled from a laptop. Engineers from ASC will discuss..."
