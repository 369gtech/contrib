description: "Container technologies such as Docker are rapidly becoming the de-facto way to deploy cloud applications, and Java is committed to being a good container citizen.\n\nIf you are running the JVM in containers already, or looking at using container tech like Docker or Kubernetes, there are some things you should know about how it works and how to do it well. With fast startup, small container images and good resource management as our goals, this talk will cover some practical tips you can use right now as well as looking at what is coming in the future of Java and the JVM. We'll also see what GraalVM can do to help."
