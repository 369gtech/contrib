description: "We are very used to generating visual results with code but are still often surprised to hear that we can create music in the same way.\n\nOh, you didn’t know that? You are not alone. Even though the idea of music programming is definitely older than all of us this concept is still pretty unfamiliar among many developers. Not for long! Let's shed some light on Sonic Pi and JavaScript capabilities of live music coding as well as music integration into our web applications with Web Audio API.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks, courses, and conferences in the following links:\nhttps://ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
