description: "Automated testing is a must nowadays.\n\nNevertheless developers often skip writing automated UI tests because it's tricky and boring. But now we have a simple and powerful tool that makes writing UI tests really effective.\n\nSelenide is an open-source library for writing concise and stable UI tests in Java. With Selenide you can forget all these timing issues, ajax and browser whims. You can concentrate on business logic.\n\nDuring my session I will demonstrate how you can write readable and stable tests that assure your application works after any changes and serve as an executable documentation. I will see it's really easy."
