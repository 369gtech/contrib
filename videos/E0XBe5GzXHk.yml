title: 'Keynote: Crossing the River by Feeling the Stones (Simon Wardley at P3X 2021)'

description: "We live in a competitive world. That competition forces change. It has always forced change. Change is normal. The question is not whether our organisations will change, that’s a given, but can we see this change before it hits us, do we know where we’re heading or are we simply floating aimlessly being carried by a river? It certainly feels that way sometimes.\n\nTo answer the question we need to understand our landscape, the economic forces at play, the context we operate within and our situational awareness of this. Can we navigate the waters, can we see a storm coming or are we being battered by rocks because we refuse to look?\n\nDuring this talk we will examine the level of situational awareness within business, why it matters and whether we can anticipate and exploit change before it hits us. We will explore how we can manage our economic environment by, as Deng Xiaoping would say, “crossing the river by feeling the stones”.\n\nThis talk was recorded live on 8 September 2021 at P3X — People Product Process eXchange 2021"
