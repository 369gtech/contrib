description: "HTML5 has won the race for the most interesting rendering technology, but with JavaScript it’s hard to write maintainable applications. DukeScript solves this problem by simply replacing JavaScript with Java. In this session, you’ll learn how you can program in Java; render in HTML5; and deploy to any device, from a desktop to an iPhone. You can either use our existing APIs enabling modern architectural UI patterns such as MVVM via the Knockout API, or immediate mode rendering via the Canvas API, but you can also create your own APIs very easily and utilize existing JavaScript libraries hidden behind a type-safe Java API.\n\n\nAuthor:\nAnton Epple\nToni is a Java Consultant and Trainer specialized in JavaFX and the NetBeans Platform...\nView more trainings by Anton Epple at https://www.parleys.com/author/anton-epple-5\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
