description: "In a mostly-connected world, offline support is more important than ever. People expect the web to work from anywhere, but it won't. If your page doesn't load, first they blame you, then the phone, then (maybe) the network.\nThis session will begin by introducing simple example of offline support. We'll then build on this to improve the experience, looking at some good and bad real-life examples. We'll look at different offline features, and ways to optimize the offline experience.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcsydney.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
