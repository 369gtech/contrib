description: "Since Martin Fowler’s article on microservices in the beginning of 2014, there has been a lot of controversy about the topic. Although most articles talk about microservices from an architectural perspective, this session intends to go further and also provide examples of and best practices for building and deploying polyglot applications in an enterprise Java environment. In the session, the build process focuses on efficiency and shows that microservices don’t necessarily cause overhead for a project. Microservices don't imply copying and pasting the same boilerplate code over and over. The deployment process in the presentation is, of course, automated but also demonstrates best practices for integration testing between different active services.\n\n\nAuthor:\nBart Blommaerts\nBart Blommaerts works for HP Enterprise Services in Belgium.
