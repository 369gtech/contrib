title: 'JeremyBytes - Lambdas & LINQ in C# - Bonus: Captured Variables & for Loops'
recordingDate: 1429565220
description: 'Lambda Expressions have a really cool feature called "captured variables". This is very useful (as we saw in Part 1), but it can also be dangerous if we try to capture the indexer of a "for" loop. Today we''ll see the problem in action, and we''ll also look at a really easy solution. For code samples and more information, be sure to visit http://www.jeremybytes.com/Demos.aspx#LLL'
