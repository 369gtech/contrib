description: "Liz MacPherson\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/135/\n\nIn my role as the Government Chief Data Steward my focus is on building a foundation to enable government to better manage New Zealand’s data, maintaining and building trust in its use. In this role, I also leave New Zealand’s open data programme.\r\n\r\nThere is so much to be gained by empowering and enabling government agencies to open their data, so that it can be safely shared and reused to inform decision-making and ultimately improve outcomes for people.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/\n\n#linux.conf.au #linux #foss #opensource"
