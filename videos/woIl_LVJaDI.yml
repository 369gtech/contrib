description: "Learning faster: Scrum's compatibility with Lean UX, Lean Startup, Design Thinking and other discovery elements\n\nSpeaker: Aaron Sanders (@_aaron_sanders), Member @ Collaborative Movement \n\nWhat do these items have in common? Most speak of cross-functional collaboration, and a few outright refer to XP as the best set of current working technical practices. This talk assumes you've got the XP/Scrum iterative development engine running, maybe even with DevOps and continuous development going.\n\nWhat’s next? Wouldn’t it be worthwhile to talk to people that will use the solution? Even on some internal thing like a Salesforce integration? What outcomes really matter to your users? Given that unused features (which there seems to be lots of) provide no value, what’s the least amount that can be done to assure what gets released, gets used?\n\nThe Scrum/XP development engine is the delivery track. How you’re learning to quickly deliver the right outcomes, the fuel for that engine, is the discovery track. Coined by some as Dual-Track Scrum, these tracks are meant to run in parallel for each and every Scrum team, all the time.\n\nWhy would you want to do that? As one CTO in the health care industry put it to me, he had a few people on a product innovation council, and has a few hundred in product development. Building more, at a faster rate, with Scrum to him seemed a waste of time if nobody used it. Ideas were also stalling in the council’s New Product Introduction process. He saw dual-track as a better way to serve the customers and their needs.\n\nAbout the speaker\n\nCoaching people to enjoy working in collaborative, learning environments excites Aaron.  Especially in pursuit of building lovable products. People ask him to train, consult, mentor and facilitate teams to better use a set of Agile discovery and development concepts, tools, methods and practices. The whole set gets absorbed through interactive training, applied in context. And it usually takes more practice for it all to sink in. Coaching allows Aaron to sense an impactful situation, helping people to integrate the set of Agile concepts, tools, methods and practices that much faster. Aaron’s effectiveness results from experiences spanning over two decades in technological and interpersonal disciplines. For him, there’s always room for improvement. Pairing with others helps improve Aaron’s collaboration skills while increasing the customer’s benefit, so he consistently seeks out people to co-train and coach with.\n\nSlides: https://prezi.com/3boepxnywhug/dual-track-scrum/\n\nEvent Page: http://2016.agilesingapore.org\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/XvSw/"
