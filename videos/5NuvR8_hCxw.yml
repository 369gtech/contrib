description: "Ever wondered how honeybees have come to be some of the world's most efficient architects? Learn how we can all use mother nature's expertise to better architect our software solutions to be more reactive, responsive and resilient through reactive architecture frameworks.\n\nI will be explaining the principles of reactive systems (including the key points behind the reactive manifesto) and using bee hives and the social behavior of bees to help visualize and understand the benefits of these principles.\n\nGrace is a developer advocate at IBM, working with Open Liberty and Reactive Platform. She has now been with IBM for a year, after graduating from Exeter University with a Degree in Biology. Moving to software engineering has been a challenging step for Grace, but she enjoys bringing a varied perspective to her projects and using her knowledge of biological systems to simplify complex software patterns and architectures. As a developer advocate, Grace builds POCâ€™s, demos and sample applications, and writes guides and tutorials to help guide users through technologies and products. Grace also has a keen passion for encouraging more women into STEM and especially Technology careers."
