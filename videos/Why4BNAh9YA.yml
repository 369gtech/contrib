description: "Parting the Clouds: Tracing Cloud Foundry for Improved Performance and Availability - Isobel Redelmeier, LightStep\n\nPushing a new app is fast - except when something times out. Maybe scaling takes too long. And, of course, you need more instances of some apps than you'd expect, or you just can't trust them to perform as well as you'd like.\n\nHow well do you really know what's going on in your Cloud Foundry? How much time do you spend ensuring availability? How much do you spend keeping excess nodes around, \"just in case\"?\n\nWhether you're an operator trying to make sure everything is running smoothly for your developers, or you're a contributor working on Cloud Foundry itself and want to gain better insight into how your components actually behave, you'll learn how distributed tracing can keep you better informed about how your platform is actually behaving so that you can spend less time and money ensuring everything is performing to your standards.\n\nThe talk will cover the basics of what tracing itself is, before a deep dive into some examples of how it can help Cloud Foundry operation and development.\n\nAbout Isobel Redelmeier\nIsobel Redelmeier is an Open Source Engineer at LightStep, where she focuses on OpenTracing and the overall goal of making the software world more observable. She's worked deep in the bowels of Cloud Foundry at Pivotal, had a brief front-end spell at Flux.io, and pushed production code in about 10 different languages while working with different companies at Pivotal Labs. Ask her about observability, security, testing, or, frankly, most other software-related topics, and she'll probably have an opinion or three!\n\nhttps://www.cloudfoundry.org/"
