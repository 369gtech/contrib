title: 'Database Design for APEX Devs - Heli Helskyaho'
language: English
recordingDate: 1587394351
description: "Database designing is a skill everybody should acquire. There is no serious application without a database and if that database is not designed well the application will not run well. In this session we will do a live demo on database designing. We will start with talk about requirement analysis, conceptual design, logical design and physical design. In the end we will generate the DDLs to create the database and the objects in it. And all this will be done using Oracle SQL Developer Data Modeler: a cost-free database designing tool from Oracle that will not only support designing Oracle databases but also other relational databases.\n\n\nA recording provided by the awesome APEX community, that built a virtual 24 hour conference called APEX@Home held on April 16th 2019.\n\nWith 24 world renowned speakers and nearly 5000 virtual attendees, this event was a huge success.
