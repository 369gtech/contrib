description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io\_The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nDeep Dive: Fluent Bit: High Performance Log Processor - Eduardo Silva, Arm Treasure Data \n\nLogging in distributed environments is very demanding, specifically when applications generate data at high rates. On this case processing data as fast as possible is one requirement, but also there is another one in high demand: low resources usage, keep your CPU and Memory usage as low as possible. The challenge is: how to optimize for fast data processing and optimizing for low CPU and Memory usage?, this is when Fluent Bit joins the game. Fluent Bit is a sub-project of Fluentd written in C language with a pluggable architecture and optimized for performance. It's becoming one of the preferred options for cloud native environments. In this session you will learn about it architecture, performance designs and best practices. \n\nhttps://sched.co/cpB5"
