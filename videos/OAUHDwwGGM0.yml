Ближайшая конференция — DotNext\_2020 Piter\n15-18 июня, Online\nПодробности и билеты: https://bit.ly/dotnext2020piter\n\n. Автор одной из самых крутых книжек по RX: ссылка.\n\nReactive applications are designed to handle asynchronous events in a way that maximizes responsiveness, resiliency, and elasticity. Reactive Extensions (Rx) is a library that abstracts away the sources of events and provides tools to handle them in a reactive way.\n\nWith Rx, filtering events, composing event sources, transforming events, and dealing with errors all become much simpler than with traditional tools and paradigms.\n\nReactive Extensions requires a change of mindset: you’ll learn to think about your application as a message hub that knows how to react to messages. After this session, you’ll understand better what Rx is, and you’ll have a starting point from which to effectively use it in your application."
