recordingDate: 1363370227
description: "From public policy to elections, from healthcare to the battlefield, our lives rely on the analysis of abundant, connected data. But if data is infrastructure, then that infrastructure's vulnerable. Enemies can confound, confuse, distort, and mislead by attacking the information we collect and the ways we analyze.\n \nIn this online event, we'll look at data under attack. We'll see how data fights crime-and how it might abuse innocence. We'll look at sock puppets, identity fraud, and Internet fakery; and we'll look at some of the ways we can fend off attack. Join us for a free Strata online event as we look at the downside of data dependency, and the coming Data War.\n\nStacks get hacked \nBy: Alistair Croll\n\nThe history of communications technology has been open, interoperable stacks, built by shameless idealists, that get attacked by bad guys. From denial-of-service attacks to SYN floods to spam to phishing, most of today's cyber-security exploits capitalize on the inherent openness of the Web.\n\nBut Big Data is at the top of the stack. It's where technology meets people. If we're living in a data-driven world, then it's one that's easily hijacked. Bad data can undermine machine learning, misinform, and obfuscate. And while that doesn't sound dangerous, it's enough to sway an election or cripple a market.\n\nSex. Drugs. Rock. And CODE: Hacking Cybersecurity \nBy: Christina Gagnier\n\nCybersecurity and \"hacking\" have become recent topics in the mainstream media. While some hacking is seemingly innocuous pranks, serious electronic breaches have threatened the security of major organizations. Developing appropriate responses to cybersecurity threats is key. Yet, in the US, legislative initiatives attempting to address the problem have so far been awkward and controversial. Christina Gagnier leads the Intellectual Property, Internet & Technology practice at Gagnier Margossian LLP, with a specialization in social media, copyright and information privacy.\n\nCrowdsourcing large scale identity theft and fraud to make bucket loads of easy money\n By: Jo Prichard\n\nThis session will demonstrate to attendees how easy it is to crowdsource identity theft to commit fraud and make money. We will look at which opportunities and segments of the population are easy targets for large scale identity fraud what insights are gained from this analysis and what can be done on the ground to narrow the window of opportunity for these types of operations and schemes. We will discuss at-risk identities, synthetic identities and look specifically at Tax Refund Fraud and Disaster Relief Fraud. Attendees will learn about how LexisNexis uses big data and massive compute capability to tackle identity theft in scale. Two insights will be shared about protecting your own identity and a simple strategy for protecting yourself from tax refund fraud. Mr. Prichard is an Architect at LexisNexis Risk Solutions. He has responsibilities to the core HPCC Systems platform technology.\n\nUsing data for EVIL: a beginners guide \nBy: Duncan Ross and Fran Bennett\n\nBeing good is hard. Being evil is much more fun and gets you paid a lot more. Duncan and Fran will give an introduction to some of the simplest things you can do to make the maximum (negative) impact on your friends, your business and the world. This session will give you a quick and easy guide to becoming an evil overlord of data without really trying. With (unfortunately) anonymized examples from the real world we will show how ordinary data scientists can have a real impact on the world around them, with very little effort. Francine Bennett is a data scientist, and is the CEO and cofounder of Mastodon C. Duncan Ross was Director of Advanced Analytics at Teradata until 2010, leaving to become Data Director of Experian UK.\n\nBlack-hat Data Science \nBy: Joseph Turian\n\nIf you're an evil genius with a yen for data science, what are your possible attack vectors? If you're a good guy and want to protect your data from unscrupulous competitors, what are your counter-attacks? How effective are they? This talk will focus on data science attack vectors that can be exploited for commercial, not military, gain. Joseph Turian, Ph.D., heads MetaOptimize LLC.\n\nWhat to do when your Machine Learning get attacked \nBy: Vishwanath Ramarao\n\nIn this talk, I cover engineering best practices for ML system design when an adversary is present. I will be covering how to do better feature engineering, learning system design and feedback management to make learning systems less susceptible to gaming and manipulation. Vishwanath Ramarao is the co-founder and CTO of Impermium.\n\nProduced by: Yasmina Greco"
