description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nWASM in the Wild West: A Practical Application Tale - Matt Butche & Taylor Thomas, Microsoft\n\nAlmost one year ago, our team released Krustlet, a Kubernetes Kubelet implementation for running WASM modules. Since then, we’ve spent plenty of time out on the frontier, implementing full Kubernetes functionality for WASM as well as other experiments like WAGI. Along the way, we’ve seen all the rough edges and gaps when using WASM in the cloud. Using these project as a practical backdrop, we’ll discuss the lessons we’ve learned and the remaining gaps to be filled (and how you can participate!) in order for WASM to become more mainstream."
