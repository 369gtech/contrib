description: "Spring Security 5.0 introduces new support for the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework and OpenID Connect 1.0.\n\nThis talk will provide a detailed overview of the new OAuth 2.0 Login feature, which provides the capability for authenticating the end-user against a standard OAuth 2.0 Provider or an OpenID Connect 1.0 Provider. This feature essentially realizes the use case “Login with Google” or “Login with Facebook” and is implemented by leveraging the Authorization Code Grant flow.\n\nThis talk will also walk through the necessary steps in setting up OAuth 2.0 Login using Google as the Authentication Provider.\n\nJoe Grandja, Spring Security Senior Engineer, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2017"
