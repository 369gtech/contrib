description: "OCI Images for Droplets and Buildpacks [B] - Julz Friedman, IBM   \n\nThe CF buildpacks workflow allows app developers to focus on the business logic of their code rather than the operational concerns of the OS that runs their code. At the same time, CF operators need confidence that all the code running in their org has been patched for the latest vulnerabilities. However, the current workflow does not currently support dynamically linked compiled languages well. This makes it very difficult to support apps written in C, haskell, et.al.; and also leaves us with a large difficult-to-protect surface area in our rootfs. We explore a solution to this problem using the new OCI container image specification, and demonstrate how this could result in a more flexible, more secure platform that supports better interoperability with the rest of the container ecosystem. For example, what if you could download your droplet and run it on any OCI container manager?\n\nThe OCI Image Spec standard gives Cloud Foundry an opportunity to unify the container and buildpack workflows, and to embrace open standards throughout the stack. An OCI Image can be used both to describe a container created using a tool such as a Dockerfile and a container created from a Cloud Foundry buildpack. Using OCI images as a primitive throughout the stack lets us revisit some of the assumptions in the platform and enables a number of new features. This talk motivates this idea and talks about our progress towards making it happen!\n\nJulian Friedman\nIBM\nProduct Manager / Software Engineer\nJulian is an IBMer and the Product Manager of Garden Core, Cloud Foundry’s Container Engine supporting both buildpack and docker apps. Julian has worked on Cloud Foundry and IBM’s Cloud Foundry deployment, BlueMix, for 4 years and before that on Cloud Technologies, IBM Watson, Large Scale Performance engagements and Map/Reduce for around 10. He holds a doctorate in Large Scale Complex IT Systems. Julian spoke at all of the past Cloud Foundry Summits and at various other conferences, including twice at ContainerSched and at CF Meetups and authored the InfoQ article “Build Your Own Container in Fewer than 100 Lines of Go” which was one of the Golang Newsletter’s 10 most popular articles of 2016."
