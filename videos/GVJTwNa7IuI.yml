description: 'Recruiters are people too, but given the backlashes we have seen along with the poor spam messages from "recruiters" you would think otherwise. So a group of recruiters familiar with the community will sit down over drinks and share some of their horror stories. From this you will learn how to improve your job search, your interviewing and maybe come to enjoy working with recruiters.'
