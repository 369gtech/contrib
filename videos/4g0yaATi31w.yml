recordingDate: 1573123307
description: "EVE Online: Defending our players from hackers and the evolution of account security\n\nIn this session I will walk you through the history of account security in EVE Online, the uniquely player-driven spaceship MMO game set in a vast online sci-fi sandbox, running for more than 15 years. With EVE being a single-shard universe known for it's huge battles, it is a big target for hackers who want to break into and steal player accounts for various purposes.\n\nI will show you what methods we have used to prevent and counter online attacks against our players, the challenges we've faced in doing so with minimal impact to user experience, where we've failed and succeeded and how we've had to constantly evolve in the process. By sharing our experiences and methods, we hope you can take advantage of them to increase the security of your own systems.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks, courses, and conferences in the following links:\nhttps://ndcsydney.com/\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
