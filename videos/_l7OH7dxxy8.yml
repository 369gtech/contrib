description: "Although it is hardly possible to find any memory leaks, deadlocks, or concurrency bugs with unit and integration tests, the vast majority of enterprise apps are barely stress-tested. A stress test not only increases the probability of finding concurrency bugs and potential bottlenecks but it also helps you understand the behavior of an application under heavy load. This session discusses and demonstrates how to continuously stress-test your Java EE applications with open source tools while having lots of fun!\n\n\nAuthor:\nAdam Bien\nConsultant and author Adam Bien is an Expert Group member for the Java EE 6 and 7, EJB 3.X, JAX-RS, and JPA 2.X JSRs.
