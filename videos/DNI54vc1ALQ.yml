title: 'XStream: Stream Processing Platform at Facebook'
recordingDate: 1635787801
description: "Real-time data processing powers a variety of use cases at Facebook. To power these, we have built a Stream Processing ecosystem[1] over the years with Scribe, Puma, Stylus, Laser, Swift etc. With XStream, we are consolidating this ecosystem under one umbrella augmenting capabilities of these systems with advanced computation libraries such as Velox, built at Facebook. In this talk, we would cover the evolution of stream processing systems at Facebook. We will also talk about XStream, a novel platform weâ€™ve built at Facebook, we will discuss its features such as joins, pluggable shuffle, interpretive engine, vectorized execution and how it consolidates the previous real-time data processing ecosystem.\n\n0:00 Stream processing use cases\r\n3:45 Brief history of real-time data processing at Facebook\r\n8:39 Introduction to XStream\n13:03 XStream Design Principles"
