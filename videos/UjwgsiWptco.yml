description: "The AR platforms we are playing with these days are getting pretty good at “single-player” experiences.  But all of the really interesting stuff begins to happen when we can share experiences in AR, and see and interact with the same mixed reality at the same place and time, together.  This is the kind of stuff that the future of AR will be all about, but it’s still very unusual.  This talk will explore what the future of location-based media might look like, why it’s still kinda hard to do, and how you can hack what we’ve already got to build it right now.  Mark will also share a live multi-user AR demo & tell you all about how he made it work.\n\nThis is the future of the internet, for real.  It’s the future of media.  This is what AR is for. Come and see how it all works and try it out for yourself!\n\nMark Rigley\nSenior Creative Technologist, Smith\nhttps://twitter.com/markrigley\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc\n\nSave 10% off any FITC event with discount code 'youtube'.\nSee our upcoming events at www.fitc.ca"
