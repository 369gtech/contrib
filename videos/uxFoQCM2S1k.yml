description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2012\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nAnders Hejlsberg - Technical Fellow in the Developer Division at Microsoft Corporation\n\nABSTRACT\nIn this keynote Anders will introduce TypeScript, a new language and toolset that makes it easier to write cross-platform, application-scale JavaScript. TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. TypeScript adds optional static types, classes, and modules to JavaScript to enable great tooling and better structuring of large JavaScript applications. The TypeScript compiler is Open Source and written in TypeScript. The compiler outputs standard JavaScript that runs in any browser or any host. The TypeScript language specification is available under the Open Web Foundation's, Final Specification Agreement (OWFa 1.0).\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
