description: "ðŸ”¥ Python Developer Masters Program:  https://www.edureka.co/masters-program/python-developer-training\nThis Edureka Live video on \"Image Processing Tutorial Using Python\" will provide you with a comprehensive and detailed knowledge of Image processing and how it can be implemented using OpenCV library. In this video, you will be working on Image processing with Python and also create a model using a convolutional neural network. Finally, we will build an end-to-end model to process and identify the handwritten images. These are the following topics that are covered in this video on Image Processing Tutorial Using Python :\n00:00:00 Introduction\n00:00:52 What Is Image Processing?\n00:02:40 Python For Image Processing\n00:03:20 Image Processing Concepts\n00:08:53 Digit Recognition Board\n\nðŸ”¹Edureka Python Tutorial Playlist: https://goo.gl/WsBpKe\nðŸ”¹Edureka Python Tutorial Blog Series: http://bit.ly/2sqmP4s\n\nðŸ”´Do subscribe to our channel and hit the bell icon to never miss an update from us in the future: https://goo.gl/6ohpTV \n\n------------------------------------Edureka Online Training and Certification---------------------------------  \n\nEdureka Community: https://bit.ly/EdurekaCommunity\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/edureka_learning/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/edurekaIN/ \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/edurekain \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/edureka \nTelegram: https://t.me/edurekaupdates \nSlideShare: https://www.slideshare.net/EdurekaIN \nMeetup: https://www.meetup.com/edureka/    \n\n#Edureka #PythonEdureka #PythonImageProcessing #ComputerVision #PythonProgramming  #PythonTraining #PythonOpenCV #EdurekaTraining\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nAbout the Python Certification Training by Edureka\n\nThis Python course is live, instructor-led & helps you master various Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib to name a few, with industry use cases. Enroll now to learn Python online & be a certified Python professional with Edureka.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nWhy learn Python Programming?\n\nOne of the key features of the Python language is its simplicity in code writing. It uses 1/5th of the code when compared to other object-oriented programs. This factor makes it the most sort after language used in trending domains like AI. AI has a wide horizon under which it deals with Machine Learning and Deep Learning.\n\nPython runs on Windows, Linux/Unix, Mac OS and has been ported to Java and .NET virtual machines. Python Programming is free to use, even for commercial products, because of its OSI-approved open source license. \n\nPython has evolved as the most preferred Language for Data Analytics and the increasing search trends on python also indicate that Python is the next \"Big Thing\" and a must for Professionals in the Data Analytics domain. \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\nWhat will you learn in Edurekaâ€™s Python Training\n\nEdurekaâ€™s Python Certification Training will help you to learn more about how to write code in python with examples. Along with that you will also learn more about python syntax, Python basics, python ide, and many more.
