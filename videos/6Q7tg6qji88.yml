description: "This video was recorded at Code Mesh V 2020 - https://codesync.global/conferences/code-mesh-ldn/\n\nSession Types: a History and Applications | Nobuko Yoshida - Professor of Computing at Imperial College London\n\nABSTRACT\nSession types is a typing discipline for concurrent and distributed processes that can detect errors such as communication mismatches and deadlocks, statically or dynamically. \n\nThis talk first gives a brief history of session types, along with a very gentle industry-friendly introduction of session types. \n\nI then talk how an extension of session types to multiparty interactions (multiparty session types) was discovered under the collaborations with industry. \n\nI then give a summary of our recent research developments on session types for verifying distributed, parallel and concurrent programs, and our collaborations with industry partners with demos.\n\n• Follow us on social: \n  Website: https://codesync.global/conferences/code-mesh-ldn/\n  Twitter: https://twitter.com/CodeMeshIO\n\n• Looking for a unique learning experience?\n  Attend the next Code Sync conference near you! \n  See what's coming up at: https://codesync.global \n\n• SUBSCRIBE TO OUR CHANNEL\n  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC47eUBNO8KBH_V8AfowOWOw"
