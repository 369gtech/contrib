description: "In the rush to make everything Agile, it is easy to jump to the conclusion that everything has to be done an an Agile way. However, there are systems that actually work better if they are left alone and there are systems that needs frequent changes to work well.\nKees Jan shows how the architecture of VisionsConnected builds on the stability of the infrastructure, without letting it slow down rapid development cycles. Attendees of the talk gain insight in a practical, bi-modal architecture, without castles in the sky."
