description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nAs Strong As the Weakest Link: Securing the Software Supply Chain- Brendan O'Leary, GitLab\n\nThe Solarwinds breach is an event that we won't truly understand for some time - if ever. Several discussions we've been having in the abstract for years have become very concrete. The systems we use to develop, build and deploy our code are essential production systems. Securing the software supply chain is one of the most underrated security aspects today. All software today is built with dependencies. However, a discussion of these dependencies - both explicit and transient - as links in the software supply \"chain\" couldn't be more accurate. And the truth is, a chain is only as strong as its weakest link. In this talk, we'll examine the complexities and sophisticated tradecraft from the various supply chain attacks. We'll also explore securing the cloud native supply chain with CNCF tools from Helm & Distribution to Cloud Custodian & Porter. More importantly, we'll delve into the simple, practical security measures that can help prevent such attacks."
