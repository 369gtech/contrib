description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2019 by Florina Muntenescu, Google.\n\nMore info: http://androidmakers.fr/schedule/?sessionId=XEB-2115\n\nOur responsibility as developers is to ship high quality features in a timely manner. But there are many factors which can hinder development: from tightly coupled, untested codebases, to differences between team members in architecture visions and API knowledge, to time pressure. \nWe tend to look at app development from one point of view: the code. But the team that writes that code is as important as the code, so we need to work on architecting a good, solid team as well, making sure that we create a common language in the team, a shared vision and an environment where team members learn and communicate freely.\n\nIn this talk, I’m going to cover some of the lessons I learned along the way and show how we, a team of four, applied them in rewriting Plaid - an open source app, initially created to showcase Material Design. We’ll see how intertwined the code and the team were for the project.\n\nAlex Karp Production"
