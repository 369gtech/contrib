recordingDate: 1520945209
description: "Dr. Michal Vakrat Wolki is one of the most inspiring women in the israeli R&D field. During our open hearted chat with Simona Valsky, they take a look back at Michal’s journey, different roles she held in her career, choices she has made and how it affected her professional and personal life. Being a successful woman in male-dominated industries and being an “immigrant” in the Valley, creates all kinds of different challenges. We get her perspective on the glass ceiling and whether it’s any different across the pond? In addition, Michal shares with us her “toolkit” with best practices from her career.\n\nDr. Michal Vakrat Wolkin - https://www.linkedin.com/in/mwolkin/\nSimona Valsky - https://www.linkedin.com/in/simonavalsky/"
