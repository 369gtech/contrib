language: English
recordingDate: 1576353319
description: "Quantum Computing is one of the most disruptive and fast-paced disciplines of the present time.\n\nFor Data Science practitioners, understanding the main elements of the new paradigm (Superposition, measurement, entanglement, Qubits, etc) can be a daunting task. In this talk, we will try to explain the main elements of the Quantum world, mapping from already known concepts from classical computing when possible.\n\nThe talk will focus on familiarizing the audience with the main elements of Quantum Information, Quantum Algorithms and how open source tools are laying the foundation of future data processing methods with quantum computers, supported with practical examples.\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
