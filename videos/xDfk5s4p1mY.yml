title: 'Designing with Light: The Upcoming Wave of Ubiquitous Projection'
language: English
recordingDate: 1588815705
description: "With so much hype around device-based augmented reality, it has been easy to overlook an existing medium: projection. Originally known as spatial augmented reality or projection mapping, the technique of using video projectors to digitally augment physical objects has been limited to high-budget events and research projects. Now, with advancements in computer vision, projector technology, and embedded computing, we are approaching an era where projection and lighting will merge to enable ubiquitous, light-based interfaces.\n\nWhat does it mean to use projected light as a medium, and how will we begin to see projected AR integrate itself into our environments? Can projection be a calm technology, freeing us from the distractions and confines of our screens?\n\nThis is an in-depth tour from Phil Reyneri, a projection mapping veteran and creative director at Lightform: a new tool that lets any designer easily create projected AR experiences.\n\nEVENT:\nFITC Toronto 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\nPhil Reyneri\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nConference Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish fitcevents videos"
