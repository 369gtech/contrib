description: 'Spring framework is widely used by Java developers because of its large functionality set and elegant integration solutions with other Java technologies. Initially Spring provided single configuration option with XML. Then annotation driven approach became quite popular. Now Java and Groovy configuration options are also available. In this talk we will discuss how to make Spring configuration easy to read and maintain, flexible enough to work in many environments, testable and reliable. I have worked with Spring framework since early 1.0-RC versions and used it almost in every project through my career. From 9 years of my practice I gathered many approaches that help me and now I want to share them with you.'
