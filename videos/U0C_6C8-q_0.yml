description: "Full title: \"Open Empowerment - A method to train, push and hack citizen powered projects\"\n\nOpen State is a series of events starting in Autumn 2013. We will explore, develop and support innovative projects that work on the future we urgently need. And everything will be open-sourced. We'll prototype the smallest cell of a sustainable society and create blueprints for everyone to adopt. Small and mid-sized groups of people can pick these step-by-step manuals from a web platform, free to use, share and rework. Until 2015 we'll promote 100 projects through continued Open State events and aim to empower thousands of local adaptors worldwide.\n\nSummit of Newthinking, 15. bis 16. November 2012\nEine Veranstaltung von http://newthinking.de/"
