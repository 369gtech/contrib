description: "Docker and Kubernetes have revolutionized the software industry in the latest years. But how can we containerize our Spring Boot apps? In this presentation, we’ll see different options, from creating our Dockerfile, to tools like Jib and we’ll focus on the new support for Docker in Spring Boot 2.3 that leverages Buildpacks. After having our container, we’ll see how to deploy and run it on Kubernetes.\n\n\nSPEAKER:\nSergi Almar\n\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\n\nATTRIBUTION CREDITS:\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAmULBywsXA&t=292s"
