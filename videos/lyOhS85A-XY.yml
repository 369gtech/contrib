title: 'How We Accidentally Created ChatRoulette on JSFiddle - Will Sentance & Alex Zai'
recordingDate: 1430417878
description: "What inspired us to build this? Setting up WebRTC (all the signaling servers and infrastructure etc) can be a huge pain – it takes 100s of code and a bunch of configuration. So instead we decided to save other engineers from doing it in the future and build out a platform that does all that behind the scenes – Icecomm\n\nIcecomm lets you add video chat to a site in 8 lines of frontend javascript and use the various SDKs (for e-commerce, in-email video chat) etc to build awesome things.\n\nWe launched at #2 Hacker News, and the front page of Reddit and Product Hunt in February and received an extraordinary response from the community – JSFiddle Chatroulette – that’s still a great place to start\n\nNow we have over 250 engineering teams working with the platform – some of the best are on the Icecomm blog."
