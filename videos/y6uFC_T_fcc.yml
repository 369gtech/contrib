description: "Spring I/O 2017 - 18 -19 May, Barcelona\n\nHow to design and develop internal tools ecosystems, so called commons? You find these in almost every company. Not so obvious task though if you need such ecosystem to stay powerful and easy to use despite constant changes in requirements.\n\nWe'll dive into structuring the ecosystem, cover API design, handling of dependencies, deciding on features and much more. All this coming from our experience (and mistakes) of building a Spring-based platform and libraries for the microservice infrastructure at Allegro.\n\nI hope to leave you with practical knowledge essential for building successful tools â€“ both for growing internal commons and for creating useful open-source libraries in general."
