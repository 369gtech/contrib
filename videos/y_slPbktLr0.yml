description: "Mathias Doenitz kicks off this year’s Northeast Scala Symposium with a thorough investigation of Akka HTTP, its use cases and the improvements it brings over its predecessor scary.io.\n\nThis talk is for those who wish to provide or consume HTTP-based APIs with Scala or Java. According to his talk’s abstract, Mathias asserts that “Akka HTTP takes reactive high-performance web interactions to the next level,” then, \"you will not want to use anything else after having tried it.\"\n\nWatch the 13 talks from NE Scala 2015: http://crcl.to/bdvun\nScala Training from NewCircle: http://crcl.to/chrua\n\nhttp://www.nescala.org/"
