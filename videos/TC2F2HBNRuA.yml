description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM SF 2020 - http://bit.ly/2wpn0SM\n\nGet involved in Code Sync's next conference - http://bit.ly/2Mcm4aS\n\n---\n\nERLANG IS GETTING PRETTY!\nby Michal Muskala\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nErlang\nTooling\nDeveloper experience\n\nTALK LEVEL: All\n\nABSTRACT\nHow much time did you spend today reading code? How many times did you have to look harder because of how the code looked?\n\nMaintaining a clear and consistent code style is hard: manual inspections often leads to endless bikeshedding and linters add noticeable overhead to the workflow. Many languages solved this issue through automated code formatters - Go, Rust, Elixir, Elm among many others. And now, thanks to the new erlfmt tool, Erlang is getting pretty as well!\n\nCome to this session to learn more about erlfmt - how it works and how it can help your team.\n\nSlides & full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/michal-muskala52/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - MICHAL MUSKALA\nEngineer at WhatsApp Erlang Team and Elixir contributor\n\nSoftware engineer, open-source developer, speaker and trainer. Michal is a member of the Erlang team at WhatsApp working on the language and its tooling and a member of the Ecto core team. He also contributes to maintains multiple open source projects including Elixir and OPT and maintains some of his own including Jason - the most popular projects on hex.pm.\n\nWhen not programming, he enjoys reading, travelling, and sailing - no matter if sunny, rainy or stormy. It's even better if all of those are combined!\n\nMore on Michal Muskala: https://codesync.global/speaker/michal-muskala52/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM SF 2020\nCode BEAM SF is powered by Code Sync.
