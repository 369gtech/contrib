description: "Recording brought to you by American Express. https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs\nKotlin has many amazing features. Some of those features are even more amazing, knowing that they are somehow supported through the existing Java programming language capabilities.\n\nThis session will explore how some of the magical features of Kotlin actually work, under the hood(ie). Get ready for code decompilation, bytecode, and explanations of R8 and D8 optimizations.\n\nIf you happened to see the presenters' talk \"Kotlin Under the Hood\" earlier this year, this is a similar concept, but with different examples. Because it's fun to see how stuff works.\n\nResources:\nKotlinConf website: https://jb.gg/fyaze5\nKotlinConf on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlinconf\n\nKotlin website: https://jb.gg/pxrsn6\nKotlin blog: https://jb.gg/7uc7ow\nKotlin on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlin\n\n#KotlinConf19 #Kotlin #JetBrains\n\nAbout the Presenters:\nChet has been on the Android team since 2010, mostly working on and leading the UI Toolkit team, but recently as a part of the Developer Relations team. He enjoys hacking code for graphics, UI, performance, and then talking to developers about it at conferences like this.\n\nRomain is an engineer at Google. He worked on the Android Framework team, leading the UI toolkit and UI renderer, and now works on new graphics related projects."
