Just the language feature, no library support apart from a few traits that allow developing coroutine adaptors.\n\nIn this session we will start with just a compiler that implements a coroutine TS and a reference networking TS implementation and through (mostly) live coding together we will develop a cool, efficient and beautiful async networking app. \n— \nGor Nishanov: Principal Software Engineer, Microsoft\n\nGor Nishanov is a Principal Software Design Engineer on the Microsoft C++ team. He works on design and standardization of C++ Coroutines, and on asynchronous programming models. Prior to joining C++ team, Gor was working on distributed systems in Windows Clustering team.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
