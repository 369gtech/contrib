title: 'YOW! Data 2019 - Hercules Konstantopoulos - Is Agile Data Science a thing now?'
recordingDate: 1563397204
description: "How come there’s no standard text on how to operate a Data Science team? At its current scale this is a young practice without a widely accepted mode of operation. Because so many practitioners are housed in technology shops, we tend to align our delivery cycles with developers… and hence with the Agile framework.\n\nI will argue that if a data team fits within Agile it is probably not performing data science but operational analytics—a separate and venerable practice, and a requisite for data science. To ‘do’ science we need a fair bit of leeway, although not a complete lack of boundaries. It’s a tricky balance.\n\nIn this talk I will share my experience as a data scientist in a variety of circumstances: in foundational, service, and advisory roles. I will also bring some parallels from my past life in scientific research to discuss how I think data science should be performed at scale. And I will share my current Agile-ish process at Atlassian.\n\nGrowing up by the mountains of Northern Greece, Hercules Konstantopoulos developed a fascination with the night sky and all its intrigue. After a career as a researcher in astrophysics that spanned ten years and four continents, he became drawn to addressing a greater variety of data-related problems. Data science ensued with work on sustainability and energy management, and now a spot as Sr Data Scientist at Atlassian, Sydney’s most acclaimed home-grown tech shop. There he focusses on converting support tickets and behavioural data into product strategy and business direction, and on creating informative and accessible data visualisation. \n\nFor more on YOW!
