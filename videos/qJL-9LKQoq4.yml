This talk presents a case  study of a BitTorrent client written in Haskell. We will look into certain patterns used to implement the client and present how it works. \nCertain tricks used will be presented. We will also present what was easy and what was hard in the implementation and draw some comparisons to etorrent, which is a BitTorrent client written in Erlang.\"\n\nFollow us on Twitter @Erlangfactory twitter.com/#!/erlangfactory\nJoin our group on Linkedin Erlang Factory linkedin.com/groups/Erlang-Factory-2003110?trk=myg_ugrp_ovr"
