title: '#bbuzz 2015: Ted Dunning -What and Why and How: Apache Drill 1.0'
recordingDate: 1433496134
description: "Find more information here: http://berlinbuzzwords.de/session/what-and-why-and-how-apache-drill-10\n\nThe 1.0 release of Apache Drill does SQL on Hadoop, but with some big differences. \nThe biggest difference is that Drill changes SQL from a strongly typed language into a late binding language without losing performance.  This allows Drill to process complex structured data in addition to relational data.  By dynamically generating code that matches the data types and structures observed in the data, Drill can be both agile as well as very fast.  Drill can analyze complex data directly with no ETL steps.\nDrill also introduces a view-based security model that uses file-system permissions to control access to data at an extremely fine-grained level that makes secure access easy to control.\nThese changes have huge practical impact when it comes to writing real applications.\nI will give several practical examples of how Drill makes it easier to analyze data.  This will include examples of how to use Drill to analyze real complex data."
