description: "(Recorded at Jfokus 2016. http://www.jfokus.com)\n\nBeyond the buzzword: a reactive web application in practice\n\nIn this talk / live-coding session we will have a practical look at how a reactive web application is different from a \"normal\" one and how resilience, elasticity and responsiveness translate into code. We will start by having a quick theoretical introduction to asynchronous computation and then build, run, deploy and load-test a small reactive web application built with the Play Framework, exploring a few key concepts such as Futures, Actors and Circuit Breakers along the way.\n\nManuel Bernhardt, bernhardt.io\n\nManuel is an independent software consultant with a passion for building web-based systems, both back-end and front-end. He's the author of \"Reactive Web Applications\" (Manning) and started working with Scala, Akka and Play Framework in 2010 after spending a long time with Java. He lives in Vienna, where he is co-organiser of the local Scala User Group. He's enthusiastic about the Scala-based technologies and the vibrant community, and is looking for ways to spread its usage in the industry. He's also scuba-diving since age 6, and can't quite get used to the lack of sea in Austria."
