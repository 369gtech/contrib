language: English
recordingDate: 1605298071
description: 'Tracing can be very powerful. It gives the ability to connect the customer experience to the backend services several hops away. This comes down to what information is in your traces. There isn''t one standard set of tags to add for EVERY application. It comes down to how traces are used and what matters to your organization. During this webinar, we will discuss the need for tracing, dive into the why (and what) you would want to trace distributed tracing, and delve into the OpenTelemetry specs and architecture on how we can tailor (or tag) our traces.'
