description: "Security has become one of the most important topics of the widespread RESTful Web services. There are currently many approaches for securing REST services, and choosing the appropriate one may not be a simple task. This session covers authentication and authorization mechanisms, from basic to complex, and detailed solutions such as OAuth and OAuth 2. It also focuses on applying security to a client whose API comes with the new JAX-RS 2.0.
