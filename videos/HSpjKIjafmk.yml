description: 'Docker is an incredible platform for the application developer. But getting visibility into the intricacies of what you are building can be a challenge. You need to understand the performance of not only your code but the infrastructure your application relies on. In this session, you will see how you can start monitoring all of the components to give you a fuller picture of the entire system. We will start by monitoring the database and server. Then we instrument the code so we can understand the bottlenecks. From there we optimize the code before deployment and continue to monitor while in production. You will see how easy it can be all in this 20 minute session.'
