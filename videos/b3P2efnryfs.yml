language: English
recordingDate: 1479323952
description: "Git is hard to grasp. This is especially true if you've worked for decades with centralized version control systems such as Perforce, CVS or SVN. This talk is about our journey to on-board 4000+ engineers with 200+ different code bases to Git at Autodesk. Amongst other things, Lars will cover how we manage the Git client setup at that scale as well as AutoDesk's experiences with large Git repositories.\n\nLars Schneier is the technical lead for Git at Autodesk, working out of Berlin, Germany. His current work involves migrating large codebases to Git and establishing Git workflows within teams. He is a Git contributor, the author of the ShowInGitHub Xcode plugin, and is an avid kiteboarder."
