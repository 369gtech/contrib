Introducing asynchronous patterns is so much more than just applying async and await to your methods; you really, I mean really, need to understand what's going on.\n\nIn this session, we'll make sure you know how to avoid crashing your applications, and how to adhere to best practices when applying asynchronous patterns in our .NET applications.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks, courses, and conferences in the following links:\nhttps://ndcsydney.com/\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
