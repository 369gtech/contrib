description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nPower Level 9000! Improving Application Performance with Chaos Engineering - Saiyam Pathak, Civo & Karthik Gaekwad, Verica\n\nChaos engineering is becoming a standard to test the resiliency and performance of cloud native applications. It allows you to validate assumptions, catch loopholes, and generally improve resiliency in your cluster. This talk will focus on the specific experiments that will improve cluster and application performance and cover tools in the ecosystem, including Litmuschaos, Kraken, and Chaos Mesh. At the end of the talk, the audience will understand the basics of experiments, apply them in their orgs, and code to run in their infrastructures. Breakdown: The idea of an experiment Application Performance Ideas Identifying Cluster Latency Issues (k8s, k3s) Improving App SLO Fixing issues with app latency Detecting latency in Service Meshes Rightsizing cluster auto-scaling issues Ways we use Chaos Experiments in our companies Demo: Running a latency Chaos Experiment continuously in a CI pipeline on k3s Chaos Tooling review FAQs about Chaos Engineering Conclusions"
