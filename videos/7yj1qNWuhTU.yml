description: "Trustworthy Graceful Degradation: Fault Tolerance across Service Boundaries\n\nDaniel Rodgers-Pryor, Stile Education\n\nDoes your service gracefully degrade when a database, cache, or remote service becomes unavailable? Are you sure?\n\nGraceful failure when downstream services are overloaded or down is critical to maintaining availability in complex systems, but because each of these failures is (hopefully!) rare, it can be hard to really trust that your systems will respond as expected in an emergency.\n\nCome along to learn: how easy it is to mess this up (repeatedly), what it takes to maintain a trustworthy system, and a set of simple approaches for testing system failures in both CI and production.\n\nView the full SREcon21 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon21/program"
