description: "Video with transcript included: https://bit.ly/2XhMLOK\n\nSam Newman shares some key principles and a number of patterns to use to incrementally decompose an existing system into microservices. He covers patterns that can work to migrate functionality out of systems hard to change, and looks at the use of strangler patterns, change data capture, database decomposition and more.\n\nThis presentation was recorded at QCon London 2020: http://bit.ly/2VfRldq\n \nFor more awesome presentations on innovator and early adopter topics check InfoQâ€™s selection of talks from conferences worldwide https://bit.ly/2tm9loz\n\n#Monolith #Microservices #SourceCode"
