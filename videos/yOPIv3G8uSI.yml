description: "Slide Deck: http://bit.ly/message-micronaut210310-slidedeck\n\nCommunication between distributed services is challenging and we want to show you a few tricks for simplifying this difficult task by using Micronaut and some fairly popular messaging solutions. In this session, weâ€™ll help you get started implementing messaging in your applications using open source tools such as Apache Kafka and RabbitMQ, as well as a managed Oracle Cloud-based option that can be plugged into your service with very little setup and configuration.\n\nhttps://developer.oracle.com/"
