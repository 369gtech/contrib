description: "Onboarding new and junior developers to the team is hard. You want them to become good, but that requires instruction, and instruction takes time. \n\nHow do we teach new programmers in a way that enables them to truly learn and be independent? How do we bridge the gaps of not only knowledge but confidence and creative thinking? What enables systematic learning, and what makes a good teacher, and how do we cooperate these ideas into our work?\n\nEVENT:\n\nYou Gotta Love Frontend 2016\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nNetta Bondy\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nYou Gotta Love Frontend Conference Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video."
