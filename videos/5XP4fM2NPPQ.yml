title: 'Using SSR to Boost Performance and SEO - Alon Kaduri'
recordingDate: 1543753100
description: "Wix is using ReactJS and Server-Side-Rendering (SSR) to generate sites.\nSupporting Wix Code meant moving from rendering of static sites to rendering of dynamic web-applications with custom user-code.\n\nThis made SSR a whole lot more complicated because now we had to also render the dynamic content on the server side.\n\nIn this lecture, Alon describes how we took SSR to the next level in order to improve site loading time and have all the dynamic content indexed by search engines. Alon focuses on the challenges we faced (and still do), such as scaling and security when running Wix Code (the user’s code) in the server.\n\nAlon works at Wix.com as an SSR team lead in the editor group, focusing on improving performance and SEO for our users.\nHe is a full-stack engineer, Javascript fanatic and has been a web development fan for the past 10 years."
