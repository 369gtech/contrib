description: "As stream processing engines become more and more popular and are used in different environments, the demand to support different deployment scenarios increases. Depending on the user's infrastructure, a stream processor might be run on a bare metal cluster in standalone mode, deployed via Apache Yarn and Mesos, or run in a containerized environment. In order to fulfill the requirements of different deployment options and to provide enough flexibility for the future, the Flink community has recently started to redesign Flink's distributed architecture. This talk will explain the limitations of the old architecture and how they are solved with the new design. We will present the new building blocks of a Flink cluster and demonstrate, using the example of Flink's Mesos and Docker support, how they can be combined to run Flink nearly everywhere.\n\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://BashFilms.com"
