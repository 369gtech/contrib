recordingDate: 1559026772
description: "Randy Shoup is a veteran of Silicon Valley, and has worked as a senior technology leader and executive at companies ranging from small startups to mid-sized places to eBay, Google, and Stitch Fix. Randy is currently VP Engineering at WeWork in San Francisco.\n\nAs the research in Accelerate and in the DevOps Handbook shows, high-performing organizations deliver more rapidly, more repeatably, and more reliably. And as an organization scales, it becomes more and more important to get the product development process right. Drawing on the speaker's experiences leading high-performing organizations at Google and eBay, this session discusses the upstream parts of that process, focusing on organization, problem definition, and prioritization. We will discuss forming small, cross-functional teams with clear areas of responsibility. Then we will discuss the importance of clearly defining the problem we are trying to solve as a team. Finally, we will cover focus and prioritization -- how we decide what to do when. You will take away actionable techniques you can apply in your own organization."
