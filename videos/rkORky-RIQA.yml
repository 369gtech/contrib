title: '"Affordable Custom Input Devices" - Jonathan Oxer, Chris Fryer (LCA 2020)'
recordingDate: 1579268399
description: "Jonathan Oxer, Chris Fryer\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/47/\n\nLearn how Open Source software and hardware can be used to build a custom “button box” which can be adapted to suit the needs of an individual, and allow them to control a computer by acting as a keyboard, mouse, or game controller. Then through their computer, they can control their world.\r\n\r\nPhysical disabilities can take many different forms. Everyone has a unique body and needs, but medical devices are extremely expensive to develop due to the overhead of regulatory compliance. The economies of scale that can be achieved with mass market consumer goods just don’t come into play when it comes to devices designed to help with specific physical problems.\r\n\r\nThere is no “one size fits all”, and in many cases it’s necessary to design and build one-off devices to suit a specific individual. With traditional approaches this is prohibitively expensive.\r\n\r\nOpen Source technologies including Arduino and 3D printing have opened the door to low-cost DIY solutions that can be customised to suit the individual.\r\n\r\nFor some people with disabilities it can be much easier to navigate in the virtual world than in the physical world. Co-presenter Chris has Duchenne muscular dystrophy and when he’s not using his computer he is very limited in his ability to interact with his physical environment, but he can do almost anything on his computer with the use of custom-built input devices.\r\n\r\nCombining these custom input devices with computers acting as his intermediaries, we have worked together on projects that allow him to reach out and control his physical environment in a way that hasn’t been possible for most of his life.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
