description: "\"I have stopped counting how many times I've done this from scratch\", said a developer when yet again a new project had to be created. Every company sets up a pipeline to take code from source control, through unit testing and integration testing, to production from scratch. Every company creates some sort of automation to deploy its applications to servers. With the deployment pipeline we're not really done, quite the contrary - this is just the beginning. Do you actually, really know what is deployed to production? In which versions? Which instances are broken and which are not? Can you perform more sophisticated production deployments? In this presentation we'll show you how you can leverage Spring Cloud Pipelines and Spinnaker together. Well start a new project for which well have a deployment pipeline set up in no time. You'll leave with a clear idea where the boundary between continuous integration and continuous delivery is, and how best to organize your delivery automation to ensure you can rapidly repave your infrastructure.\n\nSpeakers:\nMarcin Grzejszczak\nStaff Software Engineer, Pivotal\nJon Schneider\nPrincipal Software Engineer, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
