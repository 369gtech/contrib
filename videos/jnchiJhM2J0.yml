description: "Exoplanets are planets that orbit stars other than our sun. Until recently, exoplanet research has been the domain of professional scientists and large observatories. PANOPTES brings exoplanet science to students and amateurs. It combines cloud computing with low-cost, off-the-shelf electronics and open source software to build a geographically distributed array of robotic telescopes. In this session we'll explain how open source comes together with cloud computing to discover planets. We'll show you what PANOPTES is made of, how it observes the sky, and how it turns raw data into candidate planets.\n\nSpeaker: Jen Tong"
