description: "Yo ninjas, once again! I'm here with another CSS tutorial for beginners, and this time we're going to be getting familiar with the nth-child pseudo classes. They are you new best friend, trust me. If there's one structural pseudo class you should master, it's this one! Nth-child selectors help us target any child of a parent element based on it's position within the HTML structure. It is an awesome technique, and one that I hope you will enjoy using on your own projects. Stay cool, keep coding & peace, my friends :).\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO CHANNEL - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n========== CSS for Beginners Playlist ==========\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gQeDH6xYhmO-db2mhoTSrT\n========== HTML Basics Course ==========\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9ibZ2TSBaGGNrgh4ZgYE6Cc\n\n========== The Net Ninja ============\n\nFor more front-end development tutorials & to black-belt your coding skills, head over to - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg or http://thenetninja.co.uk\n\n========== Social Links ==========\n\nTwitter - @TheNetNinja - https://twitter.com/thenetninjauk"
