description: "Get the Code: http://goo.gl/yODM3\n\nWelcome to my Iterator Design Pattern Tutorial! The iterator design pattern allows you to access objects that are stored in many different collection types.\n\nYou do this by creating a common interface that these classes share. Then you have them provide you with an iterator that allows you to traverse the objects they contain.\n\nBecause they all share a common interface you can treat them polymorphically and eliminate a lot of duplicate code."
