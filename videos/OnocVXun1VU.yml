description: "Performance matters to your users. And the importance of performance doesn't dim over time - if anything, users expect better performance this year than they experienced last year. Performance is important for the long-term. While your company's aims and structure may change, its commitment to performance should not.\n\nThis talk provides strategies that build performance culture from the long term. From starting a performance culture at your company to educating and empowering teams to understand and own their products' performance, this talk presents tools and strategies that you can use to make performance last at your company.\n\nEVENT:\n\nSmashingConf London 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nAllison McKnight\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nSmashingConf Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to publish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nSmashing Magazine: https://www.smashingmagazine.com/\n\nSmashing Conference: https://smashingconf.com/"
