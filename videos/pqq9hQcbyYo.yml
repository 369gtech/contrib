description: "Erlang User Conference 2013\nMore info and slides on the website: http://www.erlang-factory.com/conference/ErlangUserConference2013/talks\n\nPeak load, and burst-y traffic are problem spaces which are often (and tragically) confused for each other, invariably to the detriment of both ops and users.  While peak-load is all about capacity management, in a burst-y situation, you might have to prioritize - or even drop! - requests.  Knowing which requests to process, and how to actually process them is the world of Active Queue Management (AQM). While AQM has long been exclusively in the domain of the TCP/IP crowd, it has been slowly making its way into the world of cloud-services, albeit with much (faulty!) wheel-reinventing.\nJoin me as I take you through a whirlwind tour of AQM, with - I promise - much more Erlang and much less TCP/IP."
