description: "Are transactions really needed? Is a  Java EE  transaction a DB transaction? What happens behind dependency injection? How can deployment be implemented? What is the performance overhead behind EJB, CDI, JPA, and JSF? Why is it difficult to write your own ORM, and what are isolation levels? What happens in a cluster? Are Java EE components thread-safe? Are application servers  black magic  technology, and if not, what happens behind the scenes? Some questions are asked over and over again, and the answers are often simpler than expected. This session answers the most frequently asked questions about application servers and Java EE.\n\n\nAuthor:\nAdam Bien\nConsultant and author Adam Bien is an Expert Group member for the Java EE 6 and 7, EJB 3.X, JAX-RS, and JPA 2.X JSRs.
