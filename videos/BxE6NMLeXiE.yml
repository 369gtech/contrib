description: "You aspire to lead with greater impact - but the problem is always that you’re busy executing on today’s demands.\n\nTo build your leadership skills you need to carve out time from your day job, but it’s easy to let immediate problems and old mind-sets get in the way.\n\nIn this session, Herminia Ibarra (Author, Act Like A Leader, Think Like A Leader) shows how managers and executives at all levels can step up to leadership by making small but crucial changes in their jobs, their networks, and themselves.\n\nYou’ll leave this session with the ability to:\n\nRedefine your job in order to make more strategic contributions\nDiversify your network so that you connect to, and learn from, a bigger range of stakeholders\nEvolve your self-concept, allowing your familiar—and possibly outdated—leadership style to develop"
