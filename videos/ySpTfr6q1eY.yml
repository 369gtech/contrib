description: "droidcon Italy webinar\n23 June 2020 \nRounak Bose, Creative Director, CookyTech\n\nA design-centric approach to development\n\nThis will cover two segments - how to incorporate design processes into all stages of a productâ€™s lifecycle; and how to NOT build an application. The first segment will be a guide to the building phase, the tools pertaining to each segment, and how to use them properly. In the second part, I will share a guide on exactly what to avoid when building an app, based on insights gained from a real-life partial failure of an app I helped design, and everything that we can learn from it.\n\nhttps://it.droidcon.com/2020/\nhttps://twitter.com/Droidconit\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/showcase/dro...\nhttps://www.instagram.com/droidconit/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/droidconIt"
