description: "Working with complex systems means that even well written code can behave in unexpected ways, leading to outages and critical issues. Kubernetes allows you to easily rollout new code and quickly revert to safe, stable releases when issues are identified. But often the damage done in the short period between deploy and rollback is significant.\n\nIn this session, I’ll show you how to limit the effect of unforeseen issues using canary deploys with Istio. I’ll also cover ways to better monitor your applications in Kubernetes to help you spot potential problems before they affect your entire customer base."
