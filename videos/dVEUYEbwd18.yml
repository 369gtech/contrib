description: "Rolling out patches for Bluetooth firmware is hard for vendors, but it is a lot of fun if you can do it yourself!\n\nCurrent state of our Bluetooth hacking projects related to InternalBlue and Nexmon. We will tell you more about some details, but in an entertaining way.\n\nWe almost won a code staring contest, because we did not use the right terms to search for leaked source code and hidden symbols. We spent hundreds of Euros on a new smartphone just to see that it announces another firmware version than what is actually insideâ€”and to confirm that the vendor knew about a vulnerability we believed to be undiscovered. We enthusiastically bought the new Raspberry Pi 4, which was announced to have Bluetooth 5.0, but in fact has the same chip as the Raspberry Pi 3+.\n\nEVENT:\n\nmedia.ccc.de 2019\n\nSPEAKERS:\n\nDennis Mantz, jiska\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nATTRIBUTION CREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwkR8bcni38"
