description: "Recorded at SpringOne Platform 2016.\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/building-modern-web-applications-with-angular2\n\nWeb development has become more complex in the last few years with a plethora of frameworks to choose from and no clear direction. Join Sergi Almar in this presentation to learn why Angular2 is a good fit for Spring developers. We'll review the Angular2 architecture and see how TypeScript allows us to build more maintable and clean applications having the benefits of a typed language. We'll look at the Angular2 component based model, dependency injection, data binding, routing, templates...to build modern web applications.\n\nNo prior AngularJS knowledge is required."
