recordingDate: 1589289832
description: "In the recent days Cloud Native has become a buzzword. A synonym that is equal with the challenge of many enterprises for their IT departments to deliver results increasingly faster. But what is the fuzz all about? Where has Cloud Native come from? What is its current state? And where is its presumably future? Are there parallels in its history with Domain-Driven Design? Is DDD still relevant? And can DDD align with Cloud Native to support in the challenges of current and future Information Technology and Software Engineering? In this session we will go on a hunt for the traces of Cloud Native and discover the journey and its relation to Domain-driven Design.\n\nSPEAKER: Benjamin Nothdurft –\_https://twitter.com/dataduke\n\nTechnical Lead for Cloud Technologies at codecentric\n\nBenjamin is an Oracle Groundbreaker, works as technical lead for cloud technologies and regional manager Erfurt at codecentric, speaks regularly at international conferences and loves to teach at several universities.
