Sasha Goldshtein, Sela Group — Automating Problem Analysis and Triage\nКонференция DotNext 2015 Moscow\nМосква, 11.12.2015\n\nWhat do you do when your application crashes or hangs in production? Even if you have good monitoring, nothing can compete with a debugger or a full process dump captured on a production system. But you can't always afford the time to analyze hundreds of crash dumps. In this talk you will learn how to perform completely automatic dump analysis and triage using Microsoft's ClrMD, a .NET library that can explore threads, call stacks, and exceptions; visualize threads and locks to form wait chains and detect deadlocks; and walk heap memory to inspect important objects for your application. With automated analysis tools you can take back full control over what happens in your staging and production environments."
