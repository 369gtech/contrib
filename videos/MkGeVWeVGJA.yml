Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nLightning Talk: Challenges in Cloud Native Forensics - Andrew Krug, Datadog\n\nAs more companies have gone cloud native the focus on resilience has largely focused on detection and speedy recovery. These are only two tactics that should be in the defense toolbox. Forensics is a discipline that has arguably suffered as log volumes and DevOps culture has become more normative. In my session, I’ll demonstrate where the gaps exist and how the ecosystem could improve capabilities around the art of forensics."
