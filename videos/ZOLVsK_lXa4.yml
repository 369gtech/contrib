title: 'Getting Started with Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing for Developers'
language: English
recordingDate: 1592579206
description: "Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing uses machine learning and automation to improve its own security, but it also takes advantage of an Oracle wallet. There are many ways you can use an Oracle wallet to enhance the security of database connections, but with Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing, it is already set up, packaged, and ready to go.\n\nLearn how to connect securely to your Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing instance with an Oracle wallet, followed by some code examples in a few languages you can use to test the connection. In addition, you learn how to create a new Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing instance in your Python application, using the Python SDK for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.\n\nBlaine Carter\nOracle Developer Advocate"
