description: "Join Ryan Nowak on a tour of ASP.NET Core’s evolution from “Project K” to present day and look forward to a few possible futures. We’ll discuss technical design details of how the ASP.NET Core stack is changing from bottom (hosting and startup), through the server, middleware pipeline, and up to high-level frameworks like MVC and Blazor.\n\nThis is a technical deep-dive talk, and will explore possible design directions of .NET 5 and future releases.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks, courses, and conferences in the following links:\nhttps://ndcsydney.com/\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
