description: "Speaker: Minh Pham\r\n\r\nMaking the state of your react apps immutable has several upsides (easier to optimize rendering with shouldComponentUpdate for eg). Immutable.js (by Facebook) was the first stab at the problem. However there are a few problems:\r\n\r\n- lack of strict typing\r\n- awkward apis\r\n\r\nImmer.js one of the few library that has done it right, even earning the high praise of React maintainer https://twitter.com/sebmarkbage/status/1032684851063705600\r\nIn this talk, I plan to explain how using immer.js can leads to better code and increase your productivity in a typical React app.\r\n\r\nAbout the speaker\r\n\r\nMy name is Minh Pham. I am an enterprise engineer from Facebook. Most of the stuffs I built are internal apps that helps with the logistic side of our business. I am a full stack developer but not long ago I spent all of my time in React land.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/React-Knowledgeable/events/265344291/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\r\nRecorded by:\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/CHIpI/"
