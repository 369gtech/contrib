title: 'UCMS ''14 - Configuration as a Service'
language: English
recordingDate: 1639766354
description: "Configuration as a Service\n\nNico Schottelius, ungleich GmbH\n\nConfiguration Management is the de-facto standard to maintain infrastructures of all sizes. Even though some of the configuration management systems can bootstrap themselves, deploying and maintaining a configuration management system requires a permanent investment.\n\nComputational resources have successfully been outsourced in the form of cloud computing and various other services like infrastructure (IaaS) or software (SaaS) are also available as a service. This talk discusses the possibility of moving from running a dedicated configuration management system to using configuration as a service, based on the cdist cloud configuration service, which allows users to configure their hosts without running a configuration management system on their own.\n\nView the full UCMS '14 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/ucms14/summit-program"
