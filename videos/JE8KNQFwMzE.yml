recordingDate: 1557517615
description: 'The new Microsoft Edge is built on a new foundation, powered by Chromium. This session will go deeper on our plans and intentions for Microsoft Edge, the Chromium open-source project, and our ongoing work in web standards communities. We will discuss how we plan to become a significant contributor to Chromium in a way that will make not just Microsoft Edge, but other browsers as well, better on both PCs and other devices. Youâ€™ll also learn how this foundation will enable us to deliver a consistent set of developer tools and application experiences built using web technologies across platforms.'
