description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nExpanding Serverless to Scale-out Kubeflow Pipelines - Yaron Haviv, Iguazio \n\nServerless frameworks enable devops automation, resource allocation on demand and auto-scaling. However, so far they only addressed event-driven workloads and not distributed, batch oriented data science tasks like data preparation and ML training. Orit Nissan-Messing will introduce the recently announced Nuclio ML Functions which is tightly integrated with Kubeflow and extends the Nuclio open-source serverless framework to auto-scaling machine learning, training and data preparation tasks. Nuclio ML functions automatically tracks experiments and artifacts, is seamlessly integrated with Kubeflow pipelines and eliminates a significant amount of devops. Participants will learn how to work with Kubeflow and Nuclio to enable CI/CD for their machine learning workloads, enabling performance and horizontal scaling, while cutting infrastructure costs and tedious development tasks.\n\nhttps://sched.co/ZepH"
