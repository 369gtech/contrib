Software Testing & QA Conference. \nOctober 21, 2016 | www.testcon.lt\n\nSo many subjects in software testing can appear to be complicated, but nowadays none as much as Agile testing. Almost everyone has an opinion about it, and none can be taken as a “general” truth; except the fact that agile testers need to reflect a different mindset and agile testing requires distinct approaches.\n\nBeyond any doubt, whether you establish a solid agile testing framework yourself or someone does it for you, it will bring many benefits. Some of the most critical ones include: a powerful foundation to cope with the agile challenges and a systematic approach to shorten the time-to-market delivery by supporting the quality of your software products in preliminary stages."
