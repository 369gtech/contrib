recordingDate: 1538620641
description: "In this talk Simon will take us on a historical voyage through the representation of information in software and the internet. From tables and charts, through mind maps, info-graphics, multi-dimensional views, and Minecraft. On the way he will explore tooling such as spreadsheets, 4GLs, RADs, workbooks, AirTable, Coda and more. With that background he’ll then dive deeply into the software architecture of a new and exciting platform currently in development, The Big Crunch, which will lead us to an interesting discussion on scale and the making of assumptions that can allow you keep growing a system... or not! Its going to be fast paced and fun, so don’t miss out.\n\nSimon is a hands on technology professional. He has worked across a varied array of industries and technologies such as trading exchanges, instant messaging, ecommerce, and IPTV with companies such as Sony, eBay, and AOL. Recently he was CTO at MYOB for 7 years and has since founded a start up called The Big Crunch. He also likes to dabble in the future.\n\nFor more on YOW!
