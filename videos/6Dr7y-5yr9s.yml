language: English
recordingDate: 1433784728
description: "Four new functionalities have been added with the new Java EE 7 release. This session covers one of the new functionalities: Concurrency Utilities for Java EE (JSR 236). Originally concurrency utilities were provided in Java SE 5 as JSR 166, which also provided a high-performance concurrent API for multicore CPU environments. However, it was not recommended for use in Java EE environments such as Web containers and EJB containers until Java EE 6. JSR 236 extends JSR 166, and it provides a useful and safe API for the Java EE environment. The session explains the history of async applications and concurrency applications in the Java EE environment and presents some demos of concurrency with WebSocket on GlassFish v4.\n\n\nAuthor:\nYoshio Terada\nundefined\nView more trainings by Yoshio Terada at https://www.parleys.com/author/yoshio-terada\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
