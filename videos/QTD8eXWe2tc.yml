title: '[LIGHTNING TALK] Johannes Stein - Scaffolding plugins for React Native'
recordingDate: 1536920841
description: "Every now and again we need to integrate native code into our React Native app. First we create the iOS glue, the Android one and this repeats over and over again for every plugin. Wouldnâ€™t it be great if there was something like react-native init ... for native plugins? I created react-native-create-library a while back and would like to present how it works, what it does and hope for some feedback to improve this CLI app.\n\nThis talk was presented at React Native EU 2017, September 6-7, Wroclaw, Poland."
