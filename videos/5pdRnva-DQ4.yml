language: English
recordingDate: 1638287952
description: "Rust is a relatively new language that has been voted as the most popular programming language in the Stack Overflow Developer Survey three years in a row and is steadily gaining popularity in programming circles, so what is going on?\nRust is presented as a systems programming language that offers both control and memory safety without sacrificing performance. In this presentation, you will get a brief introduction to Rust and learn why Rust claims to provide memory safety without a garbage collector and provides thread-safety at compile time.\nYou will also learn about the Rust ecosystem, what kind of tasks Rust is suitable for and where Rust might not be your preferred choice.\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).
