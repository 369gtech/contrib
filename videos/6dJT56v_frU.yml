title: 'EC Track - Greg Maxey - Process as Code An Introduction to the ElectricFlow Automation DSL'
recordingDate: 1446493361
description: "DevOps at scale requires predictability and consistency. A key enabler for many is “programmable infrastructure,” also known as “infrastructure as code,” which helps provide configuration fidelity across environments. But versioning and testing configurations alone can’t guarantee deployment success – you also need to make sure the workflows and processes used are as repeatable, testable and revertable as your application source code.\n\nElectricFlow provides a powerful Groovy-based domain specific language that provides DevOps teams a programmatic way to define and manipulate complex automation, pipelines and workflows along with any other object defined in the ElectricFlow platform.\n\nDuring this talk, we’ll introduce you to the Groovy DSL, and demonstrate how “process as code” can provide teams a familiar and powerful way to accelerate application onboarding, and scale up their application and pipeline modeling and testing efforts. We will also show a prototype DSL Editor / IDE that makes it easy to get started within the ElectricFlow UI."
