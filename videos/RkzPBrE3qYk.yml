title: 'YOW! West 2015 Kevin Lynagh - Using ClojureScript w/ heavy industrial equipment'
recordingDate: 1514639525
description: "Keming Labs was commissioned by a client in the energy sector to design and build a custom heavy equipment inspection tool. The tool was designed with Harel Statecharts and implemented with ClojureScript running on an Android device.\n\nIn this talk, Kevin will discuss this approach; in particular, how explicit immutable data yielded fast, on-device prototyping, easy-to-implement visual testing tools, and improved cohesion between developers, designers, and the end customers.\n\nKevin Lynagh is a Portland, Oregon-based designer and computerist.\n\nKevin is an active contributor to the Clojure/ClojureScript community and a popular UX, Clojure and Maker speaker. He has designed software for wind turbine technicians, bioinformaticians, meteorologists, and manufacturers of hipster housewares. When Kevin is not computering, he enjoys woodworking, industrial design, Olympic lifting, and snacks.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
