description: "This talk presents five partially baked ideas - these are some of my\nhobby projects that have bubbled up to the surface.\n\nI've been playing on and off with the ideas in this talk for the last\n40 odd years - Some of the question I've been pondering ask questions\nlike:\n\n   - How do we store data forever?\n   - How can we add trust to the web?\n   - How can we reduce the entropy of software?\n   - How can we make a personal computation infrastructure?\n\nI can't pretend that I have answers to these question, but only a set\nof half baked ideas as to how they might be solved - and a few small\nprototypes.\n\nErlang started as a half-baked idea and few small prototypes - so I\nthought I test some of these ideas and see if any of them gather\ninterest."
