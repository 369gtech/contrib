description: "http://www.cppcon.org\nâ€”\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2014\n--\nThis session will cover selected STL features from C++11/14, both explaining how to use them and delving into implementation techniques that could be useful outside the STL.\n\nI will avoid covering popular features you're already using (e.g. make_shared, make_unique) and obscure features of limited use (e.g. forward_list). The focus will be on useful but underappreciated features like dual-range algorithms, minimal allocators, and heterogeneous associative lookup.\n--\nStephan T. Lavavej is a Senior Developer at Microsoft. Since 2007, he's worked with Dinkumware to maintain Visual C++'s implementation of the C++ Standard Library. He also designed a couple of C++14 features: make_unique and the transparent operator functors. He likes his initials (which people can actually spell) and cats (although he doesn't own any).\n--\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
