recordingDate: 1433246231
description: "In this session, the authors of The CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java  describe how this standard can be used to secure your Java projects. They examine the dos and don’ts of several secure coding rules, focusing on rule violations that have resulted in real-world vulnerabilities in fielded systems. They also discuss how conformance to the coding standard can be enforced by static analysis and the Source Code Analysis Lab (SCALe).\n\n\nAuthors:\nDavid Svoboda\nDavid Svoboda is a Software Security Engineer at CERT/SEI. He co-authored _Java Coding Guidelines: 75 Recommendations for Reliable and Secure Programs_ and _The CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java_. He also maintains the CERT Secure Coding standard websites for Java, as well as C, C++, and Perl, and he has taught Secure Coding in C and C++ all over the world, to various groups in the military, government, and banking industries.\nView more trainings by David Svoboda at https://www.parleys.com/author/david-svoboda\n\nRobert Seacord\nRobert C.
