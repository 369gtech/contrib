description: "Google Tech Talks\nNovember, 15 2007\n\nABSTRACT\n\nNeurocomputational models provide fundamental insights towards\nunderstanding the human brain circuits for learning new associations\nand organizing our world into appropriate categories. In this talk I\nwill review the information-processing functions of four interacting\nbrain systems for learning and categorization: \n\n(1) the basal ganglia which incrementally adjusts choice behaviors using environmental\nfeedback about the consequences of our actions,\n\n(2) the hippocampus which supports learning in other brain regions through the creation of\nnew stimulus representations (and, hence, new similarity\nrelationships) that reflect important statistical regularities in the\nenvironment,\n\n(3) the medial septum which works in a feedback-loop with\nthe hippocampus, using novelty-detection to alter the rate at which\nstimulus representations are updated through experience,\n\n(4) the frontal lobes which provide for selective attention and executive\ncontrol of learning and memory. \n\nThe computational models to be described have been evaluated through a variety of empirical\nmethodoligies including human functional brain imaging, studies of\npatients with localized brain damage due to injury or early-stage\nneurodegenerative diseases, behavioral genetic studies of\nnaturally-occuring individual variability, as well as comparative\nlesion and genetic studies with rodents. Our applications of these\nmodels to engineering and computer science including automated anomaly\ndetection systems for mechanical fault diagnosis on US Navy\nhelicopters and submarines as well more recent contributions to the\nDoD's DARPA program for Biologically Inspired Cognitive Architectures\n(BICA).\n\nSpeaker: Dr. Mark Gluck\nMark Gluck is a Professor of Neuroscience at Rutgers University - Newark, co-director of the Rutgers Memory Disorders Project, and publisher of the public health newsletter, Memory Loss and the Brain. He works at the interface between neuroscience, psychology, and computer science, where his research focuses on the neural bases of learning and memory, and the consequences of memory loss due to aging, trauma, and disease. He is the co-author of \"Gateway to Memory: An Introduction to Neural Network Models of the Hippocampus and Memory \" (MIT Press, 2001) and a forthcoming undergraduate textbook, \"Learning and Memory: From Brain to Behavior.\" He has edited several other books and has published over 60 scientific journal articles. His awards include the Distinguished Scientific Award for Early Career Contributions from the American Psychological Society and the Young Investigator Award for Cognitive and Neural Sciences from the Office of Naval Research. In 1996, he was awarded a NSF Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers by President Bill Clinton. For more information, see http://www.gluck.edu."
