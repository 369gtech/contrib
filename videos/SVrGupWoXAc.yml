description: "During Java development, itâ€™s common to restart your application with (almost) every class change you make. For some applications it is not a problem at all, for others - it can be disastrous.\n\nIn this session, we will look at the options available to us to reload Java classes, from HotSwap to Java agents. There are plenty of tools that you can use to achieve class reloading. You might choose to rely on the standard JVM HotSwap, redesign your application to rely on dynamic class loaders, or integrate a reloading agent into your Java runtime. Every option has its own benefits and drawbacks, so join me for a deep dive on all your choices.\n\nFinally, we will cover some of the conceptual challenges in reloading Java classes like state, static initialisers, super class changes and much more. Attend this session to gain a better understanding of class reloading technologies and to become a more productive Java developer."
