title: 'Webinar: Extending Spring Integration for Splunk'
recordingDate: 1364831400
description: "Join David Turanski (SpringSource) and Damien Dallimore (Splunk) as they discuss and demonstrate Splunk and Spring Integration. Spring Integration provides a number of adapters out of the box to support various transports, such as JMS, File, HTTP, Web Services, and Mail. They will introduce the Splunk channel adapter, a new entry to the out of the box adapters available for Spring Integration, which allows data to flow through Spring Integration to interact with data being ingested or queried by Splunk.\n\nFor those who may be unfamiliar, Splunk collects, indexes and harnesses machine-generated big data so you can monitor, search, analyze, visualize and act on large streams of real-time and historical machine data.\nDemo Source is located at:\nhttps://github.com/damiendallimore/spring-integration-splunk-webex-demo"
