description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io\n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nManaging Helm Deployments with Gitops at CERN - Ricardo Rocha, CERN \n\nKubernetes has taken a key role at CERN both for physics analysis and core IT services, simplifying and accelerating deployments and allowing a much higher rate of updates and upgrades.    This session will describe how helm is used for managing the description and configuration of the services. How CERN uses chartmuseum to maintain its private chart repositories, and how a custom plugin is used to manage secrets in the configuration, safely pushing encrypted payloads into git repositories. How a well defined structure of umbrella charts (sometimes referred to as meta charts) is used to define high level applications with complex dependencies, and how the notion of service variants and environments is exposed.    A demo will show the full gitops lifecycle for both production and canary deployments, relying on weave flux to quickly propagate changes to clusters. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UabD"
