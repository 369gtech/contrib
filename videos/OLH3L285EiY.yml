title: 'LAMBDA Functions: Powerful And Elegant Abstractions'
language: English
recordingDate: 1505056778
description: "Python’s lambda, a tiny anonymous function, can be useful in a pinch when you’re feeling too lazy to type that extra d-e-f. But did you know that behind this little lambda is actually one of the most powerful & elegant abstractions in the history of computer science?\n\nThe lambda calculus, dating back to the work of lambda shepherd Alonzo Church in the 1930’s, lets us represent our programs - all their logic and data - as pure, anonymous functions, using nothing but (a whole lot of) lambda. Let’s take it for a spin and see what we can create: booleans and conditionals, integers, arithmetical operators, data structures… you name it. With some determination, and a little squinting, we might even see lambda do the impossible: reconcile object-oriented and functional programming. You heard it right: lambda can do it all!\n\nJoin me as we explore its astounding computational power, and walk away with a deeper respect and admiration for the almighty little lambda.\n\nEVENT: EuroPython Conference, July 2017\n\nSPEAKER: Anjana Vakil\n\nPERMISSIONS: The original video was published on EuroPython Conference YouTube channel with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nORIGINAL SOURCE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BsfMMYvGaU"
