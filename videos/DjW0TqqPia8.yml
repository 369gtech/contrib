The LA84 Foundation exists because of the 1984 Olympic Games. Their mission is to get youth life ready through sports. The IOC has decided to have Youth Olympic Games (YOG) in 2010. The purpose for these Games was said to be a method for getting young people more interested in the Olympic movement. How will these Games produce that result?\n\nSpeaker: Anita L. DeFrantz\nAnita L. DeFrantz, an attorney and member of the International Olympic Committee and 1976 and 1980 Olympic teams, is the president and member of the Board of Directors of the LA84 Foundation, which is managing Southern California's endowment from the 1984 Olympic Games.\n\nIn addition to her Olympic bronze medal performance in the 1976 Games, DeFrantz won a silver medal in the 1978 World Championships in rowing, was a finalist in the World Championships four times and won six National Championships. The IOC awarded her the Bronze Medal of the Olympic Order for her leadership role in fighting the U.S. government-led boycott of the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow."
