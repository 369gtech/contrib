description: "Latest Kubernetes Scalability Improvements - Shyam Jeedigunta, Amazon & Yassine Tijani, VMware \n\nAs the kubernetes project evolved, it started to increasingly gain adoption by enterprise and large scale users. Kubernetes, with a series of performance and scalability improvements, had come to support high scale an various fronts. However, a more recent onset of large-cluster use-cases highlighted some newer scalability limitations when adopting the “one big cluster” pattern. The project has made impressive progress in the last few releases on those.    As scalability is a cross-cutting effort across different verticals, we would like to use this opportunity to walk you through the recent scalability/performance improvements made to kubernetes in different areas and introduce the new APIs and patterns that led to these. We will then discuss key elements that Kubernetes needs to address in order to improve adoption pace of its large-scale users. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPce"
