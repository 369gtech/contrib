recordingDate: 1571337378
description: "Diverse and inclusive teams exhibit higher collective intelligence and produce better products and services. Yet in the field of DevOps, Site Reliability Engineering, and Platform Engineering, women and underrepresented minorities are hard to find. The few who persevere report harassment, microaggressions, and unequal pay. We’ll share stories of how we got to where we are, what has and hasn’t worked to build more inclusive teams, and how you can help.\n\nSpeakers: Bridget Arthur, Advisory Solutions Architect, Pivotal; Clayton Hynfield, Cloud-Native Midwife, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2019\nSlideShare: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/a-crisis-of-diversity-and-inclusion-in-devops/Pivotal/a-crisis-of-diversity-and-inclusion-in-devops"
