description: "Java ME is quite a restricted environment, specialized to fit into small-footprint embedded devices such as Java Card and set-top boxes. Today the market offers platforms with great computational capabilities and large memory footprints previously unavailable. In such a scenario, Oracle Java SE Embedded offers 100 percent code reusability and transparent deployment. This session explores, using some case studies, how to manage some crucial aspects of an embedded product development, such as the proper hardware platform and tools. The latest, in fact, has a great impact on key factors of the product lifecycle such as low-level deployment tools, boot loaders, evaluation kits for prototyping, kernel and driver availability, and finally the custom operating system.\n\n\nAuthors:\nAaron Moore\n-0\nView more trainings by Aaron Moore at https://www.parleys.com/author/aaron-moore\n\nNicola La Gloria\nI was Co-founder \nView more trainings by Nicola La Gloria at https://www.parleys.com/author/nicola-la-gloria\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
