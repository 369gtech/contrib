description: "A few years ago, I had an idea to make the web better. It was going to be great, and I had the team to build it. Nine months of late nights and lost weekends later, we launched it! The problem: no one cared.\n\nDevConf 2017 (http://devconf.pl)\n13-15 September 2017\n\nA brilliant project isn’t enough. I had to spread my vision, which was difficult for a developer like me. I learned quickly that even the best ideas needed to be sold. I had to build an audience, tell a story, and win over customers. Join me for a developer’s guide to marketing. I’ll share hard-fought lessons on page design, social networking, advertising, and analytics that will help you bring your ideas to the world."
