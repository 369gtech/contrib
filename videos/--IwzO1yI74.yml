The motivation here is that we want to better predict player churn via a prediction of your next event as a player. Unfortunately none of our data contains the playerâ€™s current feature state before playing their next game, so we have to build it from scratch. We do this by combining many streams of data and walking forward through time manually tracking the player. The resulting dataset is then used to predict the time until a playerâ€™s next interaction with the game and better understand how players are interacting with the game. - Captured Live on Ustream at https://www.ustream.tv/crunch"
