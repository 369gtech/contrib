title: 'Flinking, Fast and Slow - Caito Scherr'
recordingDate: 1571151609
description: 'Have you tried to build a new Flink project in an already well-established, non-Flink ecosystem? Curious to try it? My team built our company’s first Flink service in production and had to determine how to incorporate it into a complex environment of non-Flink services and processes. I will cover what we learned about integrating large, tier 1 Flink services, as well as more simple micro services, and the best ways we found to connect them all into a healthy and robust software system. This talk will provide pragmatic strategies and best practices for overcoming the challenges of integrating Flink into pre-existing systems in a way that is efficient and maximizes Flink’s strengths.'
