description: "F# is an incredibly versatile and expressive language and enables you to solve a wide array of problems succinctly and efficiently. This talk illustrates, with real-world examples, how the Gamesys social team is using F# to build the backend services that support around 1 million Daily Active Users (DAU) and 250 million daily requests across its social games on both mobile and web platforms.\nIn this talk, we'll demonstrate the use of F# to write clean, concise game logic as well as infrastructure code, the same techniques and concepts can be easily applied to other domains."
