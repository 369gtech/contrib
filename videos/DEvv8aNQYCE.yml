It acts as a liaison between Hadoop and your application. As there are specific nodes in a cluster each of which may have some data or is in the same track. It passes on MapReduce tasks to each of the specific nodes. Each of these nodes are then monitored, in case of failing of which, the JobTracker is notified. It may reject or resubmit the application. Once the task is completed, it updates the status.
