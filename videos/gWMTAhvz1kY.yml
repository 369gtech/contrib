In RTB, advertisers bid on individual advertisement spaces to obtain more targeted audiences. This is usually built on the backbone of large exchanges where bidders require high performance, short response times, and a high volume.\n\nBLOOM 's AdGear platform is a service offering (along other things) a unified interface that offers media buying capability over ad exchanges, as well as traditional third-party ad delivery and trafficking. An Erlang gateway is used to route dozens of thousands of queries per second from and to exchanges and ad agencies.\n\nIn this talk, we explain why we chose Erlang, and give insights in our design and architecture, including things that were learnt while developing it, chases for bottlenecks and glory..\"\n\nFollow us on Twitter @Erlangfactory https://twitter.com/#!/erlangfactory\nJoin our group on Linkedin Erlang Factory http://www.linkedin.com/groups/Erlang-Factory-2003110?trk=myg_ugrp_ovr"
