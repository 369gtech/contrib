Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nLightning Talk: Scaling the Fluent Bit Kubernetes Filter in very large clusters - Drew Zhang & Nithish Kumar Murcherla, Amazon\n\nFluent Bit and Fluentd users have experienced scaling issues with the Kubernetes filter in very large clusters. The Kube API Server could not handle the quantity of requests and became unresponsive. To address this issue, a new proposal for relying on the kubelet to obtain pod metadata was implemented. By this approach, Kubernetes filter could get metadata from the node and could mitigate the work load for kube API server. This session discusses the scaling issue in detail, the solution that was implemented, it’s trade-offs, and how it was tested."
