description: "The Eclipse Advanced Visualization Project (EAVP) allows for several diverse visualization capabilities to be added to an Eclipse workbench. Third party visualization tools such as VisIt or ParaView can be used as a backend to visualize simulation results that are then displayed inside of Eclipse. Also implemented are Mesh and Geometry Editors using JavaFX for 3D graphics. These allow for the creation and editing of data and are compatible with a variety of file types including .vtk, .stl, and .obj. All visualizations are offered through a service oriented architecture. These services allow for the visualizations to be drawn into custom placements in an Eclipse RCP app. EAVP allows for quick and easy visualization of scientific results.\n\nI am a post-masters research associate working at Oak Ridge National Laboratory."
