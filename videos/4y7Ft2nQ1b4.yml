We also examine the appropriate uses of special partitioners, combiners, and configuration optimizations. We expose some common mistakes and how to avoid them. This webcast assumes the viewer is already familiar with Hadoop and MapReduce. Our goal is to present information that helps current users get the most from Hadoop.'
