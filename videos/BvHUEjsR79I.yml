language: English
recordingDate: 1611314518
description: "In this video, we will show you how to set up the project, install the prerequisites and we will start building the user interface. By the end of this video we will have a simple UI that can show a list of mock posts.\n\nIn the series of later videos, we will be building a microblogging application. We will be building both the frontend and the backend. For building the frontend we will use React, Typescript, and Tailwind. Both the frontend and the backend service as well as the database will be built and hosted on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)."
