description: "The talk from .NET Fest conference in Kyiv, Ukraine.\nPresentation: http://bit.ly/2NsRNTR\nFb: https://www.facebook.com/dotNETFest/\nWebsite: http://dotnetfest.com/\n\n\nTraditionally developers only write unit tests (hopefully!) and QA engineers write System tests, with Selenium or some other tool. However, while this separation has some reasons, it's also a bit arbitrary and unhealthy. In this talk we'll discuss why you should be involved in all kinds of test automation and discuss best practices for utilizing the test automation to improve the development lifecycle, as well as both the internal and the external quality of your code."
