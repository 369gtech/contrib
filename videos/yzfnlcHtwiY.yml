description: 'We’ll take a look at the generative side of machine learning with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). From the simple, elegant fundamentals of building models to the uncanny and sometimes just weird computer creations, we’ll see how deep learning can augment human creativity and help us explore new horizons. Finally, we’ll use the power of the Apache MXNet framework with Clojure to bring some real GAN code to life in a demo.'
