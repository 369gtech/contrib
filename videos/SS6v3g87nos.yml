description: "As adversaries look for new methods of creating malware, steganography has seen a resurgence. In this session, we'll review this black art and uncover recent steganographic malware weaponizing techniques. We'll cover techniques that include file and image embedding techniques invisible to malware and intrusion detection systems, methods of exploiting weak networking protocols for covert communications, mischievous IoT devices, and cloud data hiding methods. But we don't stop there, our organic research has uncovered numerous other ways in which malware could be embedded in an effort to prepare threat researchers with the knowledge to improve their tools and fortify their networks.\n\nMike Raggo (Twitter: @DataHiding) is Chief Security Officer at 802 Secure and has over 20 years of security research experience. His current focus is wireless IoT threats impacting the enterprise. Michael is the author of \"Mobile Data Loss: Threats & Countermeasures\" and \"Data Hiding\" for Syngress Books, and contributing author for \"Information Security the Complete Reference 2nd Edition\". A former security trainer, Michael has briefed international defense agencies including the FBI and Pentagon, and is a frequent presenter at security conferences, including Black Hat, DEF CON, Gartner, DoD Cyber Crime, OWASP, HackCon, and SANS.\n\nChet Hosmer (Twitter: @chethosmer) is an international author, educator & researcher, and founder of Python Forensics, Inc., a non-profit research institute focused on the collaborative development of open source investigative technologies using the Python programming language. Chet is also a Visiting Professor at Utica College in the Cybersecurity Graduate Program, where his research and teaching is focused on data hiding, active cyber defense and security of industrial control systems. Additionally, Chet is an Adjunct Professor at Champlain College in the Digital Forensics Graduate Program, where his research and teaching is focused on solving hard digital investigation problems using the Python programming language."
