description: 'Robots and voice control go together like pancakes and syrup. And both robotics and voice control are being opened up to larger and larger audiences via free and/or open source toolkits. This presentation will demonstrate ways to add voice control to a web site through both local and remote APIs, then pass recognized commands to a robot, requiring no more special equipment than a $100 consumer-market robot and a bluetooth equipped laptop.'
