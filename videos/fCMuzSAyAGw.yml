From projects where teams were sliced vertically per discipline, to multi-disciplinary and cross-functional teams in agile approaches and frameworks.\nNow, as a consequence of increasing velocity, remote working, DevOps, DevSecOps, and continuous delivery, we are on the move again. In Sander's vision, teams will be even smaller than in agile, work in much shorter cycles than in Scrum, and become much more fluent. Sander has been experimenting with collaboration in teams for years and reasons about this next evolution of collaboration as domains, streams, and microteams.\nThis talk illustrates how organizations and teams doing software and product development can transition to focus on delivering value using the ever-evolving and self-organizing power of microteams and how to get there using a combination of models, such as Cynefin, moving beyond agile and Scrum, innovation funnels and backlogs, autonomy [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n00:58 Moore's Law\n03:55 The challenges ahead\n04:04 Challenge 1: Disruption\n07:25 Challenge 2: Legacy\n11:36 Now what?\n12:12 Who am I\n13:47 Welcome to the world of small moveable parts\n15:09 Stop doing projects\n21:36 Continuous flow\n30:07 Self-organizing & autonomous\n35:51 Fewer rules\n39:17 Think for yourself!\n41:08 What small problem are we solving today?\n44:17 Final thoughts\n46:38 Outro\n\nRead the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotopia.eu/february-2021/sessions/1708/how-microteams-change-the-way-we-collaborate-again\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#Microteams #Agile #BeyondAgile #RemoteWorking #HumanFactor #DevOps #DevSecOps #Cynefin #Autonomy #SmallSteps #StopProjects\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
