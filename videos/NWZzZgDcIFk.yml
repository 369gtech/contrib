description: "Slides: http://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/continuous-delivery-for-microservice-architectures-with-concourse-cloud-foundry\n\nBuilding a continuous delivery pipeline for your micro-service based architecture can be a real challenge when using more conventional CI systems like Jenkins and GoCD. How do you get a clear picture of the CI workflow and status? What artifact was deployed and when? How is this all configured?\n\nIntroducing Concourse (https://concourse.ci), an open source pipeline based CI system that focuses on simplicity, usability and reproducibility. It offers isolated builds, a range of integrations and is built upon a proven technology stack from Cloud Foundry.\n\nThis talk will demonstrate creating a continuous delivery pipeline for a Spring microservice-based application that uses Spring Cloud. You will see how the pipeline tests services, integrates and then blue / green deploys to Cloud Foundry.\n\nExpect to rush to your laptop to try out Concourse after this session!\n\nSpeaker: Alex Ley"
