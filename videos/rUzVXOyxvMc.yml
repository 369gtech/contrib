recordingDate: 1542842925
description: "In this session we discuss how we use data to increase customer experience and incomes in our live entertainment business at AEG Europe. Going through two applications first we look at how we set up a fully automated machine learning process to target fans with the most relevant ticket offers using their purchasing and browsing history. In the second half of the talk we take a look at how we use data to improve our venue operations and increase food and beverage income. By taking digital records of fans' taste and interests we can predict their thirst and appetite prior to the event and serve them better on their big night out.\n\n - Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/channel/JUMjvCF2ucj"
