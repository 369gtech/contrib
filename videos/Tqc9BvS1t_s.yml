language: English
recordingDate: 1595659607
description: "The term Microservices has been around since 2011, and has continued to gain in popularity for building and maintaining complex systems. Even so, building Microservices is not an easy task to accomplish. Many have tried. Some have succeeded. Far more have failed. If you'd like to learn about Microservices from the experts, who for many years have helped their clients to implement the architecture and solutions successfully, please join this online discussion panel comprised of:\n\n- Susanne Kaiser (Independent Tech Consultant, Germany)\n- Vaughn Vernon (Chief Architect, VLINGO, USA)\n- Jimmy Bogard (Chief Architect at Headspring, USA)\n- Jérémie Chassaing (Software Architect, France)\n- Vladik Khononov (Sr. Cloud Architect @ DoiT International, Israel)\n- Tomasz Jaskula (Host at OSS & DDDFR)\n\nAs the title indicates, we will talk about all topics related to Microservices given our allotted time. We will discuss proven practice guidelines, as well as bust some myths. You will even gain an understanding of whether you should use Microservices at all, or choose another architecture.\n\nYou can also be part of this interactive discussion and ask questions through the online comments!"
