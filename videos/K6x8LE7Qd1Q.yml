description: "Presenters: Sam Brannen (Swiftmind) and Rossen Stoyanchev\nSpringSource has innovated extensively around testing in the past, something which continues today -- one of the most exciting new features in Spring Framework 3.2 is Spring MVC Test. What makes it so interesting is the comprehensive support for testing web applications and context hierarchies with the Spring TestContext Framework as well as comprehensive support for out-of-container Spring MVC tests.\n\nJoin Sam Brannen and Rossen Stoyanchev to see these new Spring Web testing features in action."
