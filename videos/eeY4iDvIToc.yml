description: "Java EE 7 provides a strong foundation for developing the back end for your HTML5 mobile applications. This heavily code-driven session shows you how you can effectively utilize Java EE 7 as a back end for your Apache Cordova mobile applications. The session demonstrates Java EE 7 technologies such as JAX-RS 2.0, WebSocket, JSON-P, CDI, and Bean Validation. It provides an overview of the basics of Apache Cordova as well as the tooling support added in NetBeans 8. The session also demonstrates an integrated approach to rapidly developing HTML5 mobile applications with Java EE 7 and NetBeans and concludes with best practices and pitfalls.\n\n\nAuthors:\nMichael Finocchiaro\nCurrently Senior Director of the 3DEXPERIENCE Platform including sales, pre-sales, communication, marketing, advertising, and other aspects required for promoting this critical transformation of the DS Solution Portfolio.
