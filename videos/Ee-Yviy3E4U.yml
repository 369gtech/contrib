And what are you excited about the most?\n18:47 What was your favorite topic at React Native EU 2021 conference?\n22:15 What's coming up with the new React Native Architecture? What's the connection between JSI, Turbumodules, and Fabric?\n24:39 When when the re-architecture (TurboModules, Fabric) rollout will be available\nto the community? And will users be able to use it while working with React Native 0.67?\n28:54 What is the largest number of platforms you run React Native on in production? How much real code sharing is there? And what are the drawbacks of maintaining many platforms?\n33:09 What are your thoughts on React Native support for wearOS? Or wearables in general?
