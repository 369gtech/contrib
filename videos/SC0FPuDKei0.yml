description: "Presenter: Josh Long\nSlide: http://www.slideshare.net/joshlong/rest-apis-with-spring\nCode: https://github.com/joshlong/the-spring-rest-stack\nToday's applications don't exist in isolation. REST applications and web services are a great way to connect applications together. REST is a design principle that imposes no constraints on the client except basic HTTP support, which all platforms provide. Designing REST services, however, is still as much art as it is science, as standards are emerging. Join Spring Developer Advocate Josh Long, and stealth presenters Craig Walls and Oliver Gierke, as they introduces some of the ins-and-outs of REST API design with Spring, building on Spring MVC, Spring HATEOAS and answers some commonly- asked questions like how to secure REST-ful services, and how to tailor payload serialization to your specific use cases.\nLearn more about REST on http://www.spring.io\nat\nhttp://projects.spring.io/spring-framework/ (spring MVC's REST controller)\nhttp://projects.spring.io/spring-hateoas/"
