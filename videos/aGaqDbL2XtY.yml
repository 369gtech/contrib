description: "Many of the biggest impacts of technology have been driven by monopolies and their network effects. The question is what kind of monopoly we choose, and what impacts our choices create. When we choose open standards as our monopolies, we get vast open networks -- HTML, TCP/IP, and other systems where anyone can compete. When we choose walled gardens as our monopolies, we get a very different results -- Apple, Facebook, and Twitter control precisely how and when competition and entrepreneurship can happen. We're faced with this choice right now, and the decisions we make will define the next twenty years of technology in health.\n\nJohn Wilbanks\n\nKauffman Foundation for Entrepreneurship\n\nJohn Wilbanks works on open content, open data, and open innovation systems.
