description: "Recorded at SpringOne Platform 2016.\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/developing-microservices-with-aggregates\n\nThe Domain Model pattern is a great way to develop complex business logic.\n\nUnfortunately, a typical domain model is a tangled, birds nest of classes.\n\nIt canâ€™t be decomposed into microservices.\n\nMoreover, business logic often relies on ACID transactions to maintain consistency.\n\nFortunately, there is a solution to this problem: aggregates.\n\nAn aggregate is an often overlooked modeling concept from the must read book Domain Driven Design.\n\nIn this talk you will learn how aggregates enable you to develop business logic for the modern world of microservices and NoSQL.\n\nWe will describe how to use aggregates to design modular business logic that can be partitioned into microservices. You will learn how aggregates enable you to use eventual consistency instead of ACID.\n\nWe will describe the design of a microservice that is built using aggregates, and Spring Cloud."
