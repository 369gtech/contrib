description: "Chris Stankaitis, The Pythian Group\n\nIn 2015 I gave a talk on Data Driven Hiring at the first SREcon EMEA. Three years later I would like to revisit that talk, and discuss what's changed and what has remained the same since I first put in place a new hiring system based on evaluating \"potential\" rather than hard skills.\n\nWith the speed of changing technology, we have shifted to a reality where companies need people with growth mindsets who are able to embrace change and pick up new technologies fast. Gone are the days when the most technologies on a resume wins the race, and hiring managers are now working to replace their old methods with ones that validate a baseline of technical competency but focus on hiring for unknown unknowns.\n\nEven if you are not a manager, interviewing for new roles is a constant in our world. This talk will help you understand what many managers are looking for and will give you an understanding of the evolution of the hiring process in the event you have not changed jobs recently.\n\nView the full SREcon18 Europe Program at: https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon18europe/program\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
