description: "File Systems as a Service [I] - Silvestre Zabala, SAP  \n\nVolume services are a new feature of Cloud Foundry that allow service brokers to expose services which are mounted as a file system into run-time environment of the bound applications. Volume services thus allow legacy applications which expect a persistent and shared file system to run on Cloud Foundry.\n\nThis session will give an introduction to volume services, how to use them, and show you how to build your own file system service.\n\nAndreas MÃ¼ller\n\nSilvestre Zabala\nDeveloper, SAP SE\nSilvestre Zabala is a developer at SAP SE working on the SAP Cloud Platform which runs on Cloud Foundry. Silvestre is currently working on the File System Service which provides access to file system storage to Cloud Foundry apps."
