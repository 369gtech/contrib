recordingDate: 1527758057
description: "Developing secure software at scale is a multifaceted challenge. It ranges all the way from detailed technical aspects such as picking a good password hash function to software engineering cultural aspects such as treating security as software property just like quality. The challenge is even greater when facing a massive codebase evolved by a large highly productive developer community.\n\nStefan Andersson started out with security as a developer way back in the mid-nineties. Working his way through architect type of roles he is now a security coach at Axis Communications.\n__________________________\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry.
