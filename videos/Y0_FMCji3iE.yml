description: "Filmed at http://2016.dotcss.io on December 2nd in Paris. More talks on http://thedotpost.com\n\nAs we all know, everything rendered out of CSS is in a box model. That is why not many people are as enthusiastic as Wenting is about using CSS to draw, since everything has to be some sort of rectangles. In this talk, Wenting works inside of the box and transforms a single div to this mustache icon, all this live!"
