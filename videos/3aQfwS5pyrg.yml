title: '"Desktop Linux, without a keyboard, mouse or desk" - Shervin Emami (LCA 2020)'
recordingDate: 1579213052
description: "Shervin Emami\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/52/\n\nHumans are extremely fast at using a keyboard and mouse on a desk, but all 3 of these have bad long-term health risks. Are there any OTHER ways of using a desktop PC? What if you use Linux instead of the more common OSes? What if you're a hardcore full-time Linux programmer and therefore need a lot of functionality and customisation, and you need enough speed and reliability to use it long term? This talk will show some examples of how these are all possible. I'm a full-time Linux computer programmer that doesn't use my keyboard or mouse. Note that I said it's possible, but I didn't say it's easy!\r\n\r\nI'll show demos of speech recognition (for dictation, programming, and mouse control), head tracking & eye tracking mouse, foot pedals, handheld switches, RFID password entry, LED status, and forced regular breaks using Bluetooth proximity detection to make sure you actually step away from the computer regularly.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
