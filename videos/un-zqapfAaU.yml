title: 'Making predictions using incomplete data - Jonas Mortin'
recordingDate: 1536064455
description: "In real business problems data is often incomplete. Even when relevant data is being collected, it might not have been collected for long enough to lay the foundation for well-performing models and algorithms. This presentation is about an approach to a specific real-world problem in which a majority of the data was incomplete: building a battery life prediction for batteries with a long longevity using survival analysis. The idea of this presentation is that everyone should learn something new – survival analysis is not very common as a machine learning method, but it can help solve fairly common business problems. We welcome people of all (OK, most) knowledge levels of data analysis and machine learning.\n\nJonas Mortin works as a data scientist at Verisure Innovation where he is one of the driving forces in empowering Verisure’s systems with AI and machine learning. Previously, he has worked as a business intelligence consultant and a research scientist. He’s always been interested in conveying complex things in a simple manner. Jonas has a PhD in Atmospheric Sciences and Oceanography at Stockholm University, and a Masters in physics at Lund University.\n___________________________\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry.
