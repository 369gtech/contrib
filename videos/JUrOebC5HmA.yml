recordingDate: 1416604241
description: "Applying the paradigms of core.async in ClojureScript\n\nIn this talk you’ll see a Clojure program that visually demonstrates Clojure’s concurrency semantics and then see how to solve the same underlying concurrency problems using core.async. You’ll see the mapping between programming paradigms you already know and core.async concepts. You’ll apply this in the browser with ClojureScript.\n\nJulian works in Financial Services and is a family man. In his spare time he writes and presents on all things software related. Julian is the author of the upcoming book Clojure Recipes."
