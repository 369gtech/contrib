description: "Tonƒái Galiƒá - Automating my role, making myself superfluous since my first job ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nBuilding a GameBoy emulator with Elixir and Scenic\n\nTalk in three words: Fun, Embedded, Scenic\n\nAbstract\nScenic is a nice new framework in the growing Elixir toolbox. In search for a fun project to learn it, Tonƒái decided to combine it with a childhood dream: to write his own GameBoy emulator. In this talk he'll go over the basics of Scenic and see how it, together with Elixir, does/doesn't help write his own emulator.\n\nObjectives\nInspire attendees to try out Scenic in their next (embedded) project. Talk about things that Scenic is useful for and the type of projects for which it is less useful for.\n\nAudience\nThis talk assumes attendees already has some Elixir knowledge. Prior knowledge about UI systems, emulators etc are not required.\n\nThe speaker \nTonƒái is a polyglot web developer with a broad range of interests and also a broad range of experiences. He started out with Perl/CGI around 1999, throughout the years he has worked with Java, PHP and C#/.NET. In the last few years, he has focused on Ruby/Rails but now he is in love with Elixir/Phoenix and the functional aspects of programming languages. He is the organiser of the Amsterdam Elixir meetup, Elixir Bootcamp and was a co-organiser of Code BEAM lite Amsterdam.\nGithub: Tuxified\nTwitter: @Tuxified\nMore on speaker\n\nElixirConf EU\nWebsite: www.elixirconf.eu\nTwitter: www.twitter.com/elixirconfeu\nMail: info at elixirconfeu"
