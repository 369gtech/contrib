Code refactoring is used to improve code design to make it easier to understand and extend. Writing understandable code will allow others to easily modify it and in the end you'll also find you write code faster because of code refactoring.\n\nI explain what it is in the video as well as cover the refactoring bad smells and 2 code refactorings to get you ready for what is coming."
