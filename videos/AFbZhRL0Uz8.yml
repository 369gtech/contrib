The Prototype design pattern is used for creating new objects (instances) by cloning (copying) other objects.\n\nIt allows for the adding of any subclass instance of a known super class at run time. It is used when there are numerous potential classes that you want to only use if needed at runtime. The major benefit of using the Prototype pattern is that it reduces the need for creating potentially unneeded subclasses."
