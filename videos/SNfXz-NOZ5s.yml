description: "Last summer I bought an electronic drum kit. I'm thoroughly enjoying playing it (badly) but I've spent even more time talking to the kit over a USB MIDI connection, in an application which allows you to load, edit and save the drum kit configuration. Personal projects are always fertile grounds for learning and reflecting, unburdened by deadlines and other external forces.\n\nThis session will look at specific aspects of the (C#) code - particularly mutability and efficiency - but more importantly, we'll reflect together on the nature of personal projects and how we can use them to become more effective in our professional coding lives.\n\n(Drumming not included, for everyone's benefit.)\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks, courses, and conferences in the following links:\nhttps://ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
