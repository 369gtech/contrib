description: "For the last 20 years Paul has stubbornly resisted the temptation to draw a steady paycheck or to grow larger than his own 1-3 person NYC based graphic design practice. While consciously maintaining a small office, Sahre has nevertheless built a large presence in American graphic design. The balance he strikes, whether between commercial and personal projects is evident in the physical layout of his workspace: part design studio, part silkscreen lab, part classroom.\n\nHe will share what has been happening lately at O.O.P.S. (Office of Paul Sahre) including the publication of his book, Two-Dimensional Man: A Graphic Memoir, his recent move to New Jersey, as well as work for clients as diverse as Malcolm Gladwell, Public Bikes, New Directions Publishing, the band They Might Be Giants.\n\nPaul Sahre\nOwner, Office of Paul Sahre (O.O.P.S)\nhttps://twitter.com/psahre\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
