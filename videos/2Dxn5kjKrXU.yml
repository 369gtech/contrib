description: "Erin Zimmer\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/139/\n\nBefore there was the Internet of Things, there was the Internet of Webpages. And, unless you're really committed to Curl, you probably access the Internet of Webpages using a browser. But browsers are a bit like digestive systems - everyone has one, but you don't really know how it works, and sometimes it makes weird noises or bad smells.\r\n\r\nDoctors learn about bodies by performing autopsies, so let’s try the same thing with a browser. We’ll find some browsers that died of natural causes, and have a poke around inside. We’ll start with a primitive browser, that only has the ability to display text and follow hyperlinks. From there, we can follow the evolution of images, layouts, CSS and JavaScript. Along the way, we’ll gain some insights into the historical circumstances that led to modern browsers being the way they are, and hopefully end up with a better understanding of some of their quirks.\r\n\r\n*No browsers were harmed in the making of this talk\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
