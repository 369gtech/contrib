description: "PyData DC 2018\n\nThere are many stories of developers creating databases that don't operate at scale. The application is good, but the database won't work the realistic volumes of data. It's like a horror movie where they never looked behind the door, ran into the dark forest and night, and discovered the database was the monster killing their application. How can we leverage Python to avoid scaling problems?\n\nSlides - https://www.slideshare.net/PyData/avoiding-bad-database-surprises-simulation-and-scalability-steven-lott\n===\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
