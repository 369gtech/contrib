If they have used multiple languages in the past, they now have a pretty good view of the basic constraints of the language.    When it comes to communication systems, it's not as much common knowledge the design choices made and the impact they have. Come hear Eric Anderson discuss a variety of communication systems, from IPC to message queues to REST, modern and historical, and the various features they provide and some trade-offs involved. Learn where gRPC fits and how its design choices impact your service design. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UaXa"
