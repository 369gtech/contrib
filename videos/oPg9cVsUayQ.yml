title: 'Powering Kubernetes Operators with Ansible by Krain Arnold at DevOps Unicorns'
recordingDate: 1571146218
description: 'As the adoption of Kubernetes becomes more and more prevalent, it is more important than ever to create management strategies that will scale as complexity increases. One attempt to address this problem is through the use of Kubernetes operators. In this talk Krain will explain the origins of operators, the problem they are meant to solve, and the current state of the community efforts around them. He will then show how to use the operator framework SDK in order to leverage the power of Ansible to enable Kubernetes management.'
