recordingDate: 1475434540
description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2016\n—\nC++ has historically had many options for database connectivity but has lacked a standard interface that other languages, such as Java, have had for a long time. This talk will present a standards grade interface along with experience with a reference implementation that includes support for at least 6 databases. A key aspect of the design is to show how modern C++ features can be used to achieve a high degree of both efficiency and ease-of-use. Specific features to be covered will include type conversion, connection pooling, I/O binding for scalars and arrays, row sets, direct/polymorphic interfaces, policy based design, the driver interface, and details on the implementation. Forward looking standards proposals, such as ranges and variants, will also be included in the discussion. \n— \nErik Smith\nEngineering Manager, TranscendInsights\nErik Smith is a member of the clinical analytics team at Transcend Insights in San Diego.
