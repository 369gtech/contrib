language: English
recordingDate: 1471640016
description: "Great software companies aren’t just adept at storing, managing and analyzing data. They are also expert at leveraging data to fundamentally change the user experience, improve profitability and efficiency, and even develop entirely new business models. This requires developing smart applications that deliver information in context - the right information, to the right person or machine at the right time in order to take action. In this panel discussion, we’ll explore how great software companies are upending traditional industries through the use of data and smart applications, discuss the implications for enterprises in more traditional industries, and provide a blueprint for developing smart applications to deliver information in context.\n\nSpeakers: Anup Ojah, Humana; Fintan Ryan, RedMonk; Andre Langevin, CIBC; Brian Dunlap, Southwest Airlines; moderator: Jeff Kelly, Pivotal"
