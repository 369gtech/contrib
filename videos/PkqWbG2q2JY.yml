description: "In The Belly Of The Whale: Tales From Haskell In The Enterprise\n\nWhat is it like to bring Haskell to a large enterprise with an established culture? There are success stories for specialized teams, but what about the mainstream? We've been working in the trenches alongside enterprise developers doing Haskell for nearly 3 years and have lots to report. Ranging from the Haskell language and the ecosystem around it to how it has impacted the systems and people working with it, we will examine the journey from an introduction that took us into stormy seas and the vision of clear skies ahead.\n\nDavid is a self-taught software craftsman with a background in mathematics. He loves working with people to make things and is always looking for ways to improve the craft of software engineering. As a partner at Flipstone, this had led to the adoption and promotion of Haskell across multiple projects and clients. The rest of David's time is devoted to his family, especially playing board games and learning music.\n\nTrevis works with teams writing real-world applications in Haskell as well as helping team members with little to no experience in the language get up to speed. His focus is delivering high-quality and maintainable systems using practical Haskell, along with other tools. Other interests of operating systems, security, choice, and usability, drive Trevis during spare time.\n\nFor more information on YOW! Conference visit, www.yowconference.com.au"
