title: '"Practical Fractals in Space" by Michelle Brush'
recordingDate: 1411279696
description: "Fractals have uses beyond generating virtual coastlines and making colorful dorm room posters. In particular, space-filling curves such as Hilbert or Morton (Z-Order) are immensely valuable in building data structures to store and search multidimensional data. This talk will cover the practical uses of space-filling curves, how they are implemented, and how they can be used to improve traditional data structures.\n\nMichelle Brush\nCerner\n@michellebrush\n\nMichelle Brush is a math geek turned computer geek with 14 years of software development experience.
