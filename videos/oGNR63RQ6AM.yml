description: "RubyConf has been the main annual gathering of Rubyists from around the world since 2001.\n\nRubyConf is brought to you by the team at Ruby Central, as well as a small but dedicated corps of volunteers. While we depend on the awesomeness of the whole Ruby community to contribute to a terrific experience every year, there are a few individuals that work especially hard to produce RubyConf.\n\nFocused on fostering the Ruby programming language and the robust community that has sprung up around it, RubyConf brings together Rubyists both established and new to discuss emerging ideas, collaborate, and socialize in some of the best locations in the US. Come join us in Los Angeles for what will surely be the best RubyConf yet!\n\nOne of our key goals for RubyConf is to provide an inclusive and welcoming experience for all participants. To that end, we have an anti-harassment policy that we require ALL attendees, speakers, sponsors, volunteers, and staff to comply with â€” no exceptions."
