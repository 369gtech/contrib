title: 'CON7272   Building Applications with JRuby 9000'
language: English
recordingDate: 1449839114
description: "Ruby has come a long way since JRuby first ran Rails in 2006. Frameworks such as Rails have grown up with the modern web, now supporting WebSockets, microservices, and integration with JavaScript client libraries such as Ember. Concurrency utilities modeled after the JDK are helping Ruby scale horizontally. Applications can be built with Rake—or with JRuby plugins for Gradle and Maven. Maven poms can be written in a beautiful Ruby DSL. Swing, JavaFX, and other graphics libraries become easy and fun with JRuby. Sass and Asciidoctor are already being used in Java apps, thanks to JRuby. And you can bundle up the whole thing in an executable JAR or WAR file; your DevOps will never know it’s Ruby. Come to this session to see what JRuby 9000 can do for you in 2015.\n\nSpeakers:\nThomas Enebo, Senior Principal Software Engineer, Red Hat\nThomas Enebo is co-lead of the JRuby project and an employee of Red Hat. He has been a practitioner of Java since the heady days of the HotJava browser, and he has been happily using Ruby since 2001. Thomas has spoken at numerous Java and Ruby conferences, co-authored \"Using JRuby\", and captured the hearts and minds of impressionable programmers. When Thomas is not working he enjoys running, anime, and drinking a decent IPA.\n\nCharles Nutter, Principal Software Engineer, Red Hat\nCharles works on the JVM and JVM languages at Red Hat."
