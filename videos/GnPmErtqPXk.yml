title: 'PyPy - Automatic Generation of VMs for Dynamic Languages'

description: "Google Tech Talks\nNovember, 14 2007\n\nIn Search of Speed and Flexibility. PyPy and the Art of Generating Virtual Machines\n\nWe all want our favorite dynamic language to be faster, to be even more\ndynamic and to pick up nifty ideas from its peers.\n\nBut this is so much work!\n\nThere ought to be a better way to implement dynamic languages that\nenables growth and necessary change with less effort and more ease.\nWriting yet another interpreter in C or even Java is not it.\n\nPyPy is a framework to implement dynamic languages that embraces this\nchallenge. It allows us to write such languages in the form of simple\ninterpreters, expressed in a rich subset of Python. This means that\nthe resulting implementations can can be evolved with reasonable\neffort.\n\nPyPy then generates a variety of virtual machines (VMs) from a single\nsource. We can therefore target a wide range of environments,\nincluding C/Posix, Java, or .NET. This avoids the major source of\nfragmentation within a dynamic language community -- the need for a\nseparate language implementation for each virtual machine. It also\nmeans that languages as distinct as Python, Prolog and Smalltalk can\nshare the bulk of our compiler machinery.\n\nThe flexible toolchain which is necessary for virtual machine\ngeneration turns out to be good for other things as well. Traditional\nimplementations for dynamic languages have to make some very hard\ndecisions early, which then become entrenched in the whole codebase,\nmaking it difficult or impossible to change later. It can be nice to\nexperiment with different garbage collectors, but not if you have to\nwrite a complete new implementation of your favourite language for\neach one. With PyPy you don't have to. You can also generate and\ntailor a JIT-compiler for the language at hand, putting to rest the\nnotion that flexibility must come at the expense of speed.\n\nSpeaker: Samuele Pedroni\nSpeaker: Armin Rigo\nSpeaker: Jacob Hall√©n\nSpeaker: Laura Creighton"
