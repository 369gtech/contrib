description: "Consistently serving data to users around the globe is a challenging yet very interesting problem that is at the core of many application designs today. At HeartFlow, we have customers in Europe, Japan and the United States. In order to ensure a great quality of service, but also keep the data of our customers secure and compliant with the various regulatory bodies, we worked actively at designing a system of API services deployed in various geographical regions. In this session, we will be going over our current design, and describe some of the scalability and availability challenges we have encountered. We will finish by presenting an evaluation of the performance of the architected solution.\n\nRazik Yousfi\nPrincipal Architect\nHeartFlow Inc.\n\nRazik Yousfi is the Principal Architect at HeartFlow focusing on designing scalable architectures for its image-based processing pipeline and data management, leading the web visualization team and driving Technology excellence.
