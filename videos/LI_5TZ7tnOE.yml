title: 'KotlinConf 2019: Kotlin for Science by Alexander Nozik'
language: English
recordingDate: 1576488366
description: "Recording brought to you by American Express. https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs\nKotlin is a good candidate for the next language for science in general and physics in particular. In this talk I would like to describe some applications of Kotlin in particle physics (analysis automation, Monte-Carlo simulations and general computations), discuss barriers for Kotlin adoption in scientific community and present recent results of scientific library development in Kotlin (kmath and some other projects).\n\nParticle physics and Kotlin actually make for a great combination as Alexander Nozik will share with us in a chat about his experience bringing Kotlin into his physics research. We will compare the use of Kotlin to the current tech stacks used in science and research and explain how programming education and science applications can mutually benefit each other.\n\nResources:\nKotlinConf website: https://jb.gg/fyaze5\nKotlinConf on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlinconf\n\nKotlin website: https://jb.gg/pxrsn6\nKotlin blog: https://jb.gg/7uc7ow\nKotlin on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlin\n\n#KotlinConf19 #Kotlin #JetBrains #ParticlePhysics\n\nAbout the Presenter:\nPhD in particle physics. Main interests: neutrino physics, data analysis and scientific software. About 11 years of overall developer experience: ~9 years in Java and ~3 years in Kotlin. Currently working as a senior researcher at INR RAS and MIPT and as deputy head of MIPT laboratory for nuclear physics methods."
