title: 'Push Notifications that Don’t Suck - Zan Markan'
recordingDate: 1574090076
description: 'Few technologies allow us to interact with our app users when our apps aren’t in the foreground. Push notifications systems, such as FCM allow us to do just that. They are also almost universally hated by users, because most notifications just plain suck. In my talk I’ll be exploring the reasons why that is the case and why you should be designing your notification experience to be relevant first and foremost. This goes from knowing who to notify, when to notify them, and what is the correct amount of information to serve. (No easyJet, your SALE NOW ON notification is not that). This talk will cover tips and tricks for better user targeting, showing relevant content, as well as styling them using the latest and greatest of P’s APIs and best practices.'
