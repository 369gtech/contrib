recordingDate: 1445327287
description: 'Scrum is really good at turning task into solution. Problem is that it is very hard to know in advance if your tasks are "make this waste" or "create this value". This is where Lean comes to the rescue. By putting high emphasis on measurements and experimentation you can turn your guesses into real high value tasks. Definition of done should not be only technical. Each task should be measured from business side and be done only when business kpis are hit or we have learned why our guess was wrong. Presentation will include short intro into Lean and practical examples of applying Lean thinking in pre and post development phases of the tasks.'
