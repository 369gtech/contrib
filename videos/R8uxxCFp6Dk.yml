description: "Intro: Virtual Kubelet - Ria Bhatia, Microsoft & Anubhav Mishra, HashiCorp \n\nVirtual Kubelet has most recently been accepted into the CNCF as a sandboxed project. In this session we will go through the benefits of the project and the landscape of providers that contribute to VK in the open. We will highlight the HashiCorp Nomad provider and the Azure provider for Azure Container Instances. Folks can expect to learn about three different use-cases for Virtual Kubelet including, burst capacity, abstraction of infrastructure, and translating any APIs into Kubernetes APIs. We hope to spark new ideas, and conversation by bringing up a new way to connect Kubernetes to \"any\" service or technology. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPin"
