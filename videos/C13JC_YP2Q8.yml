description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2012\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nLinda Rising - Queen of Patterns & Author of Numerous Books\n\nABSTRACT\nResearchers have identified that we hold one of two mindsets toward ability: (1) that we have a fixed amount of talent or intelligence, what we are born with and there's nothing we can do about it; (2) that we are born with a certain amount of talent or intelligence, but we can all improve by working hard. These two mindsets: \"fixed\" and \"agile\" not only determine how we feel about our own success or failure but also how we feel about others. Researchers tell us that we are hardwired to stereotype others based on a very small amount of information. Now they say there is a connection between our mindset and how quickly we judge others and how open we are to seeing how others can improve. If we can do a better job of holding an agile mindset, just imagine how much more creative, innovative, and cooperative our workplaces and homes can be. \n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
