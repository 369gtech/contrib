description: "From the 2014 O'Reilly Velocity conference in Santa Clara, CA, Mark Zeman's lightning demo keynote, \"Responsive Web Performance in the Wild.\"\n\nResponsive Web Design (RWD) is now a well-established technique yet it's adoption is still surprisingly low. Often when responsive sites are designed the approach is primarily from a visual design perspective and teams struggle with the complexity of changing design and navigation patterns let alone any performance concerns.\n\nWe'll survey a wide number of responsive sites and visualize how well optimized they are for different device viewports and identify common issues and the techniques being used to improve performance.\n\nThe impact of specific responsive techniques (responsive images, inlining CSS/JS, conditional loading. Etc.) on improving performance will be examined through case studies including The Guardian, newzealand.com and others.\n\nYou'll walk away with insight into which techniques had the greatest impact on performance as teams redesigned and transformed their websites into responsive multi-device capable sites.\n\nAbout Mark Zeman (SpeedCurve):\nMark Zeman is a Creative Director at Digital Arts by day and Founder at SpeedCurve by night.\n\nWatch more from the 2014 Velocity Conference: http://goo.gl/JoMfvo\nFind out more about Velocity: http://velocityconf.com/\n\nDon't miss an upload!
