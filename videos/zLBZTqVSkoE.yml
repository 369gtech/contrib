title: '#HITBGSEC D2: Creating A Fuzzer For Diameter And LTE Telecom Protocols - Sergey Mashukov'
language: English
recordingDate: 1569832442
description: "Diameter is an authentication, authorization and accounting protocol that is widely used between the LTE core nodes by mobile network operators. While multiple methods for connecting subscribers to networks have been used over the years – including exchange and SS7 – Diameter is the latest protocol. While security vulnerabilities in SS7 are well known, it’s often assumed that Diameter is more secure. In this talk, I will describe my experience in creating a tool for fuzzing Diameter protocols.\n\nI will start with short overview of telecom signalling security and then describe vulnerabilities found while using the fuzzing tool. I’ll then cover the technical and administrative challenges specific to fuzzing telecom equipment using examples from our practice. The talk will cover topics such as:\n\n1) How protocol specifics reflect in fuzzer architecture\n2) Use of existing protocol stacks for building fuzzers\n3) Which additional tools may be needed in MNO Test Lab environment and how to adapt fuzzer for it\n4) How to reproduce issues reliably\n5) Lessons learned on communication with MNO representatives when vulnerabilities are discovered\n\n=== \n\nS. Mashukov attended Lobachevsky State University of Nizhny Novgorod, Russian Federation, receiving his B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in Computer Science in 2010 and 2012, respectively. Before joining Positive Technologies in 2016, he worked for 6 years on maintenance and development of a Diameter Base implementation for the one of the most deployed telecom platforms in the world. As a telecom security specialist, his main point of interest is security of the Diameter protocol. He performs Diameter security audits for international MNOs and conducts research on the protocol weaknesses. Sergey is also the general developer of the Telecom Vulnerability Scanner tool and member of the Telecom Attack Discovery development team. Past speaking experience – Exploiting vulnerabilities of 4G Diameter interoperator network (Positive Hack Days 8, 2018) – Diameter Security: An Auditor’s Viewpoint (11th International Conference on Network and System Security (NSS-2017) Helsinki, Finland, 2017) – Description of attacks aimed at disrupting services for subscribers (GSMA RIFS#55, 2017) – Insecurity of mobile networks: Yesterday – Today – Tomorrow (Positive Hack Days 7, 2017)"
