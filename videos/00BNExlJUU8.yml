description: "Talk recording from JSNation Live 2020, the biggest JavaScript conference in the cloud: https://live.jsnation.com\n\n# I See What is Going on: Visual Testing for Your Components\n\nMany modern web frameworks use components as their building blocks.\nIn this talk, I will show component testing using Cypress - and I mean \"show\" literally. You will see the component running inside a real browser, you will interact with the component like a real user, and you can debug the component using the real browser's DevTools. Finally, I will go through the current open source and commercial options for visually testing the component's styles and rendering."
