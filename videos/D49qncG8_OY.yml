title: '#ChefConf 2014: Jamie Winsor, "The Berkshelf Vision"--SFW'
language: English
recordingDate: 1400781750
description: "This is a follow up from the Chef 2012 talk, \"The Berkshelf Way\". \"The Berkshelf Way\" focused on cookbook authoring best practices and how to use the most cutting edge Chef development tools. \"The Berkshelf Vision\" expands upon this idea and explores the bigger picture of building applications with Chef in mind from day one. Introducing Chef as early as possible in your development cycle allows you to adopt the Continuous Delivery pattern easily.\n\nThis 45-60 minute talk will walk you through building, releasing, deploying, and testing an Erlang/Elixir OTP application from your build server to AWS using Chef. You will learn how to build an release an OTP application for your target environment using the very same cookbooks used to deploy your application to production. This talk culminates with the idea of \"build promotion\" where we will take all build artifacts and promote them from a dev environment to a staging environment.\n\nLast year we learned how to walk and his year we will learn how to run."
