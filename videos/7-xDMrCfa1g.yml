description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\n编译程序与运行时间协同设计以支持基于 Webassembly 的 FaaS | Compiler and Runtime Co-design to Support Webassembly-based FaaS - Wei Tang & He Jie, Ant Group\n\nWebAssembly (Wasm) 是为高效执行和紧凑表示而设计的一种安全、可移植的低级代码格式。随着越来越多的特性被标准化，许多源语言将被编译成 Wasm。其将逐渐成为 FAAS 的主力。我们相信编译程序和运行时间协同设计是有空间的，可以解决 FAAS 中的不同问题。\n\nWebAssembly (Wasm) is a safe, portable, low-level code format designed for efficient execution and compact representation. As more and more features are standardized, plenty of source languages will be compiled to Wasm. It will be gradually becoming the main force of FAAS. We believe there is room for compiler and runtime codesign to address different problems in FAAS."
