description: 'Defending an enterprise is a balancing act. I have worked as an offensive testing vendor to several global organisations over 18 years. This talk explores the challenges that today’s CISOs face - the threat landscape, overall shortage of infosec expertise, the ever evaporating shelf life of infosec products and an increased burden of compliance requirements. I will share my experiences from working with highly effective CISOs and internal infosec teams and what it takes to function on the razor’s edge.'
