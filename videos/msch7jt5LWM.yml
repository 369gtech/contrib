language: English
recordingDate: 1472051929
description: 'You may have seen them at conferences: the professional artists who turn presentations into these awesome graphical artworks. But also the people who sit quietly with a notebook and some colorful pens who just make colorful notes with fancy pictures for themselves. You might even have envied them, thinking ''I wish I could do something like that''. Well the good news is: you can! No drawing skills required! Come to my session with a notebook and a pen, and I''ll tell you all about sketchnoting, why I do it, how it''s done, and more. After this session, your notes will never be the same anymore.'
