description: "CacheFilter: Flexible HTTP Caching in Envoy - Josiah Kiehl, Todd Greer\n\nWeb traffic relies extensively on caching proxies, and Envoy needs robust HTTP caching support to perform that role, but scaling and feature requirements vary too much for a \"one size fits all\" implementation. CacheFilter is an Envoy filter that handles the many caching-related request and response headers and directives, with the customizability and extensibility to support anything from single-server deployments to planetary-scale caching systems with extensive bespoke needs."
