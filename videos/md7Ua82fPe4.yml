description: "Client hints are both server headers we can detect on the back end and objects we can reference in JavaScript (e.g., navigator.connection) that application developers can use to tailor application resource delivery to accommodate users’ devices and preferences for reduced data usage.\n\nIn this talk, we’ll cover the various client hints available. By the end, you’ll understand how to sniff for them on both the front and back end, and adjust your application on the fly to adapt to the user. You’ll also get some inspiration as we step through a few recipes involving these useful little hints. You won’t want to miss it!"
