description: "Google Tech Talks\r\nApril 22, 2009\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nThis interactive talk will examine two major questions: What is the mind? and How can we create a healthy mind?  We'll examine the interactions among the mind, the brain, and human relationships and explore ways to create a healthy mind, an integrated brain, and mindful, empathic relationships. Here is one surprising finding: the vast majority (about 95%) of mental health practitioners around the globe, and even many scientists and philosophers focusing on the mind, do not have a definition of what the mind is! In this talk, well offer a working definition of the mind and practical implications for how to perceive and strengthen the mind itselfâ€”a learnable skill called mindsight.  Then well build on this perspective to explore ways that the mind, the brain, and our relationships are influenced by digital information flow and also how they can be moved toward healthy functioning.\r\n\r\nPresented by Daniel J. Siegel, M.D."
