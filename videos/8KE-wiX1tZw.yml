description: "Full title - Olgun AYDIN and Krystian Zieliński: TrashAsistant: A kivy App, which uses Deep Neural Networks, for helping trash segregation\n\nWe have developed a mobile application using kivy framework. It uses Deep Neural Networks to help segregating trashes. Thanks to this app, before throwing trash to specific bin, you will know which trash bin you should throw to. Only thing you will do is just taking a photo of the trash via the app.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.
