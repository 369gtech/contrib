description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nEvolving Prometheus for More Use Cases - Bartek Plotka, Red Hat & Chris Marchbanks, Grafana Labs\n\nPrometheus is a well-known CNCF Graduated project that allows cheap and effective monitoring capabilities using metrics. With a rich ecosystem of exporters and integrations, Prometheus allows you to collect metrics from your applications running in Kubernetes and beyond in no time. There were many opportunities to learn about Prometheus, its data model and capabilities at every past KubeCon around the globe. This talk will be different. As the cloud-native ecosystem evolves and more organizations adopt cloud-native approaches, all projects are innovating and seeking improvements. We mean things like Kubernetes clusters “as cattle”, multi-cluster applications, eBPF, edge services and more. To keep up with demands for different deployments and architectures, Prometheus evolves too. In this talk, you will learn how you can use and extend Prometheus for those different use cases. In addition, we will highlight advanced, experimental, or upcoming functionality to help with your use cases."
