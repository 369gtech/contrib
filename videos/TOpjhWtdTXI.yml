title: '#7 e-Meetup | Mark Rendle - Zen And The Art Of Software Development'
language: English

description: "There is a book called Zen And The Art Of Motorcycle Maintenance, by Robert M. Pirsig. As he says in the introduction, it’s not really a book about Zen, or motorcycles. It’s about Quality: what it is; how to define it; how to achieve it.\n\nIn software development we talk a lot about Quality, and the general consensus seems to be that we’re not very good at it. So this talk will look at Quality through the lens of the book, discussing what we might take from it and apply to the things we build, and to ourselves, to try and make things better. Hopefully without going insane like the book’s protagonist. There will be a little bit about Zen, a little more about software development, and none at all about motorcycles."
