recordingDate: 1449583103
description: "Web development may not necessarily be going away tomorrow, but there’s no question that the next generation of application development is already upon us and is all about mobile devices and the cloud. An enterprise mobile cloud platform supports the development of mobile apps that connect to enterprise resources through a shared cloud infrastructure. It hosts a well-defined set of APIs for accessing those resources and enables the use of mobile services such as push notifications, device management, and geolocation, all with airtight integrated security. In this session we’ll describe such a platform and show how app developers, server-side orchestration architects, and resource administrators all play a role in the enterprise apps of today.\n\nSpeakers:\nJason Haley, Consulting Member of Technical Staff, Oracle\nJason Haley is an architect at Oracle and has been working with object-oriented system software and enterprise Java infrastructure for over 15 years. He lead the development of Oracle's application server EJB container, as well as the Fusion Middleware infrastructure component integration. He now spends his time in the enterprise mobile area of the cloud helping to architect Oracle's Mobile Cloud Service platform.\n\nMichael Keith, Architect, Oracle\nMike Keith has been an object-oriented programming, enterprise, distributed systems and persistence expert for over 20 years. He has been an active member of the Enterprise Java (Java EE) platform expert group as well as many of the subspecifications that make up the enterprise Java portfolio.
