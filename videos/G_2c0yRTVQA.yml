title: 'KEYNOTE: Sharing what we love: The Apache Flink story at Pinterest'
recordingDate: 1635787801
description: 'Pinterest is a visual discovery platform that helps over 478 million Pinners find and share ideas that spark inspiration. In this presentation, we will share the story of Pinterest’s journey with Apache Flink. Why we moved from Kafka Streams to Apache Flink, and how Flink has helped us transform our business with new real-time experiences for Pinners, like “Idea Pins” and real-time machine learning signals. We will also explore lessons we learned building, staffing, and operating our open source technology stack and the benefits of working closely with the Flink community to serve our business needs at scale.'
