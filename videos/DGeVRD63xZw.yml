description: "PyData DC 2018\n\nThe recent advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence are amazing! Yet, in order to have real value within a company, data scientists must be able to get their models off of their laptops and deployed within a companyâ€™s data pipelines and infrastructure. In this session, I'll demonstrate how one-off experiments can be transformed into scalable ML pipelines with minimal effort.\n\nSlides - https://www.slideshare.net/PyData/endtoend-machine-learning-pipelines-for-python-driven-organizations-nick-harvey\n====\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
