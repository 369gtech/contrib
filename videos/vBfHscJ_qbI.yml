title: 'A practical introduction to CI/CD with CircleCI'
recordingDate: 1605859607
description: "Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CI/CD) concepts are increasingly adopted by many technology organizations and teams. CI/CD enables teams to establish processes that increase velocity, collaboration and quality of their codebase. CI/CD enables developer & operations teams to break down unnecessary silos and gain a deeper knowledge of their respective arenas, while focusing on the important things like shipping great software.\n\nIn this talk we’ll cover the Whys, the Whats, and the Hows of setting up a CI/CD pipeline and making it work for us as we strive to ship better software, faster. We’ll finish the presentation with a hands-on demo of building a sample pipeline with CircleCI.\n\n## About Zan\n\nZan is a developer advocate at CircleCI, on a mission to educate and inspire developers on the topics of CI/CD, DevOps, and software quality.\nAcross his career he has worked in companies of various sizes, from enterprises to own startups, and everything in between, and across industries as diverse as retail, AI, and developer tools.\n\nHe’s passionate about serverless technologies, mobile development, and developer experience.
