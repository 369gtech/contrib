description: "Mark Smalley is The IT Paradigmologist and Ambassador at the non-profit ASL BiSL Foundation and an IT Management Consultant at Smalley.IT, he writes and speaks extensively about IT ‘paradigms’ such as DevOps. He is trusted advisor and catalyst in the fields of Application Management (ASL) and Business Information Management (BiSL). People collaborate with Mark to discover where they are and to visualize where they want to be. He achieves this with presentations, awareness workshops & strategy sessions, trend papers, vision statements & policy documents, quick scans & assessments, behaviour workshops, RACI workshops, and coaching.\n\nA background in application management and service management gives Mark a solid foundation. His experience also includes line management with people responsibilities, product development and marketing of IT services.  He is also affiliated with, APMG International, BrightTALK, BRM Institute, GamingWorks, IT4IT Forum, IT Chronicles, ITPreneurs, Pink Elephant, Taking Service Forward, Topconf, and Van Haren Publishing. \nMark has spoken at 100+ events in 20+ countries.\n\nA fast-moving, outside-in talk that 'sells' the value of DevOps to business executives, finds the weakest link in the value stream and explores the often troubled relationship between IT people and normal people (the business).\n\nThere is much hype around DevOps, so what are we actually talking about? DevOps improved Agile by speeding up deployment (and more). But how do you 'sell' DevOps to business executives who don't understand IT?\n\nNo business value is realized until the users actually use the systems well. This is often the weakest link in the IT value chain, so you need to extend your scope.\n\nCollaboration is difficult and collaboration between business and IT even more so. What kind of behaviour is effective? Learn from workshop results from practitioners in 11 countries.\n\nBut why \"Kill DevOps\"? This refers to an ancient Zen saying about a monk’s journey towards enlightenment and awakening. If you think that you’ve found Buddha, think again, because you never will. It’s the same with DevOps: it’s about continuous experimentation and learning.\n\nTakeaways\nIn this lively session, you’ll learn to:\n- Define DevOps as the set of cultural norms, technical practices and architecture\n- Explain the value of DevOps to business executives\n- Examine your value chain and discover whether your weakest link is in IT or the business\n- Explore the often-troubled relationship between business people and IT people\n- Adopt the right attitude to continuous learning and experimentation"
