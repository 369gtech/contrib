description: "Panel: Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes - The Blending Continues - Cornelia Davis, Pivotal; Uwe Fassnacht, IBM; Bernd Krannich, SAP SE; Evan Brown, Google; Troy Topnik, SUSE; Ross Gardler, Microsoft and Moderated by Swarna Podila, Cloud Foundry Foundation\n\nThe integration of Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes was one of the major topics during the Cloud Foundry Summits 2018 in Boston and Basel. Earlier panel discussions there created quite some interest: “Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes - Will it blend?” (http://sched.co/DdZr, https://youtu.be/4ow7IumxkOM) and \"Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes - Did it blend?\" (https://sched.co/FRyD, https://youtu.be/QkQe3354Y6Q)\n\nIn a sequel to these panel discussions, representatives of major companies in the Cloud Foundry ecosystem will reconvene to assess the status of an integration between Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes, the progress that has been made since the CF Summits Boston and Basel, and provide updates to the visions these companies have for a future of Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes.\n\nAbout Swarna Podila\nSwarna leads community efforts at the Cloud Foundry Foundation, fostering collaboration and promoting kindness. Prioritizing people over technology, she focuses on finding and amplifying the untold stories and lesser-known innovations of the people who comprise the Cloud Foundry community. Before joining the Foundation, Swarna worked as a product marketer and software engineer for Avi Networks, Citrix and Symantec, and has built and strengthened communities throughout her career. She loves to spend her non-screen time outdoors with her family.\n\nAbout Uwe Fassnacht\nUwe is leading the product management team for Cloud Foundry at IBM. He is currently working on ways to bring Platform as a Service (PaaS), Containers as a Service (CaaS) and Functions as a Service (FaaS) together into a comprehensive experience for both developers and IT organizations.\n\nAbout Cornelia Davis\nCornelia Davis is Vice President of Technology at Pivotal, where she works on the technology strategy for both Pivotal and for Pivotal customers. Currently she is working on ways to bring the various cloud-computing models of Infrastructure as a Service, Application as a Service, Container as a Service and Function as a Service together into a comprehensive offering that allows IT organizations to function at the highest levels. She is the author of the book “Cloud Native: Designing Change-tolerant Software” by Manning Publications (https://www.manning.com/books/cloud-native).\n\nAbout Bernd Krannich\nBernd is a Technical Lead at SAP working on Cloud Foundry topics in SAP Cloud Platform. In the Cloud Foundry community, he is working on bringing Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes closer together. During his 20 years at SAP, Bernd has held various roles in software engineering. He is a regular speaker at developer conferences. In his spare time, he is an overambitious but undertalented runner.\n\nAbout Evan Brown\nEvan leads Cloud Foundry engineering efforts at Google. Before joining Google, he worked on Cloud Formation and Elastic Beanstalk at AWS.\n\nAbout Troy Topnik\nTroy is a Senior Product Manager responsible for SUSE Cloud Application Platform. He began working with Cloud Foundry shortly after its open source debut in 2011, and has been a technical writer, instructor, and product manager with the ActiveState and HPE Helion Stackato teams.\n\nAbout Ross Gardler\nRoss has worked in open source for close to 20 years now. For much of this time, he has been independent, though for the last 6 years he has worked for Microsoft. If you do the math this means he joined Microsoft as prior to the \"Microsoft Loves Linux\" message. His role, within Microsoft, has always been to ensure that Linux and open source workloads run well on Azure for both customers and partners. Cloud Foundry is just one of the solutions Ross and his colleagues work on. Ross continues to be very active in open source generally and is currently the Executive Vice President of the Apache Software Foundation.\n\nhttps://www.cloudfoundry.org/"
