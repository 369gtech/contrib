description: "by Zach Corleissen\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/UD2.119/multikuber.webm\n\n\nHow Kubernetes SIG Docs changed our stack, our git workflow, and the world. One year ago, the Kubernetes documentation group (SIG Docs) received a request: could we host a Chinese localization of the docs? One year later, the answer is yes--we host Chinese docs, as well as several other languages, with more localizations in the works. This talk is about what happened with Kubernetes SIG Docs in the course of one year: the easy part (changing our site stack from Jekyll to Hugo), the difficult part (changing our git workflow), and the most challenging part (opening ourselves to internationalization). I'll briefly discuss the technical hazards we encountered (swapping Markdown parsers, Black Friday bugs), what worked well versus what didn't, and what we recommend for others looking to internationalize midstream. \n\nRoom: UD2.119\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 11:30:00+01"
