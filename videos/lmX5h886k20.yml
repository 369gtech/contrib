description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nDeep Dive Into Building a Secure & Multi-tenant SaaS Solution with NATS - Wally Quevedo, Synadia \n\nThe NATS project turns 10 in 2020, and what started as a simple and high performance messaging system written in Go to build event-driven architectures using Pub/Sub, has since then evolved into a component that can allow the seamless communication of streams & services across multiple regions, thus simplifying further the stack required to deploy globally available services. In this talk, you will learn from one of the maintainers of the project how to create applications in Go that take advantage of NATS messaging and security features by demonstrating how to implement a minimal chat application that is secure and globally available. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Zext"
