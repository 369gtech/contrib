They also often don't have the awareness of how even small differences can accumulate and cause a lot of stress for new immigrants - stress which can often be alleviated by answering a few questions and pointing them in the right direction.\n\nSome immigrants think that the cost of moving to a new country should be solely on them and they put a brave face on when dealing with everyday frustrations. It can affect their mood and ability to be a great team member, and perform in their role the way they'd like to.\n\nIn this talk, I'm going to identify areas in which new immigrants on your team might need support from you and how to help them navigate those issues. If you'd like for your co-workers to bring their whole selves to work, helping them feel safe and supported is key, especially while they learn the culture of their new chosen country.\n\nI'm also going to talk about my personal experience as a recent immigrant, that might be helpful for other folks dealing with that new reality. Naming problems and talking about my path can help them realize that it really is hard, there is no shame in asking for help!"
