description: "One of the difficulties of developers starting to apply Test Driven Development (TDD) is letting go of preconceived notions of design and allowing themselves to evolve it.\n\nI have successfully used TDD As If You Meant It as a way of showcasing how design grows when doing TDD. TDD As If You Meant It is a set of constraints created by Keith Braithwaite that forces developers to let go of their set blueprints and allow the design to evolve. I've noticed in code retreats and dojos that the technique is very difficult to get right. In this session, I will explain how to start correctly, how to apply all the rules and how it shows the evolution of software design.\n\n// This talk was given by Alex Bolboaca at SC London 2017, a conference dedicated to Craftsmanship values, XP practices & clean code.
