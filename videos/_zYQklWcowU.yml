title: 'High-Speed Cryptography in Java: X25519, Poly1305, and EdDSA'
language: English
recordingDate: 1540402023
description: "Adam Petcher, Principal Member of Technical Staff, Oracle\n\nJDK 11 includes support for the first of a new breed of cryptographic algorithm that features improved performance, trustworthiness, and security in cloud and multitenant environments. This session describes the features and implementations of some of these algorithms: X25519 key agreement, Poly1305 authentication, and EdDSA signatures. The presentation focuses on the techniques used to develop high-performance, secure implementations of modern cryptographic algorithms in Java. No knowledge of cryptography is required, and the session should be relevant to anyone who is interested in Java performance."
