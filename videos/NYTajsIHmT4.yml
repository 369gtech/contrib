title: 'Kate Meyer - The Fundamental Flaw in Flat Design'
recordingDate: 1544211058
description: "Flat design is an aesthetic style that doesn’t use any realistic or three-dimensional visual effects. When designers pursue a flat aesthetic, they often end up removing most of the signifiers (visual clues that tell users what’s interactive) from their interfaces. This lack of signifiers, combined with the popularity of flat design in the mainstream web since 2013, has been slowly altering how your users move through digital interfaces.\n\nIf your organization is considering adopting a flat, flat-ish, flat 2.0, or minimalist aesthetic, you should first be aware of the potential consequences. Even if your site isn’t flat, you can bet your users are experiencing flat design on other sites, and it’s changed their expectations of your designs. This talk explains what’s causing this epidemic of click uncertainty, and how you can avoid its negative consequences.\n\nKate Meyer\nhttps://twitter.com/kate__meyer\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc\n\nSave 10% off any FITC event with discount code 'youtube'.\nSee our upcoming events at www.fitc.ca"
