Data leaks are just a small part of the problem. Data generated by algorithms or collected by applications beyond users' control have direct influence on their lives – credit score, job opportunities or exposure to biased news and advertising. GDPR [new data protection regulation] gave users stronger safeguards and new tools to protect their data. Privacy by design is no longer an aspiration - it became a requirement. But it won't become reality without people who build and design technology! Every day you make important choices that have real consequences for users' privacy. Let me convince you to use with power with a sense of responsibility.\n\nRead the full abstract: http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2019/katarzyna-szymielewicz\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - KATARZYNA SZYMIELEWICZ\nprivacy by design believer \n\nExpert in human rights and technology, lawyer and activist.\n\nCo-founder and president of Panoptykon Foundation – Polish NGO defending human rights in surveillance society.
