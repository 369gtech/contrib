description: 'Codemotion Milan 2015 - Keynote track Methods: "Quality is a variable" by James Higgs - Software engineering practices have matured tremendously in recent years, but too often they are applied thoughtlessly and without a true understanding of why or when they might be applicable. Frequently, engineers will debate the "best" or "correct" way to do things without wider reference to the problem at hand. In this talk I will show how a pragmatic approach to quality is required if we are to truly make digital products that matter.'
