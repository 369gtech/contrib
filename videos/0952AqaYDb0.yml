Turns out yes and we made a way to do it. It's called Capsule.\nI'll go over this mind-blowing tool that produces recordings that look like videos, but behave like websites. These are videos that you can actually interact with.\nI'll cover some of what went into both the frontend and backend to make a tool like this work.\n\n----\n\n\"DevSecOps - Risk Advisory Framework: A Different Approach to Shifting Left\" Abstract:\n\nUsing a DevSecOps approach, we've created a semi-automated process for software engineers and test engineers to participate in the security process before creating code.\n\n----\n\n\"Wrangling JSON with jid and jq\" Abstract:\n\nJavaScript Object Notation: We've all heard of it. Most of us deal\nwith it every workday. Something that ubiquitous deserves its own\ndedicated power tools. This talk introduces two of the most popular.\n\nThe JSON Incremental Digger, jid, is the perfect tool for visually\nexploring the structure of an unfamiliar JSON document. https://github.com/simeji/jid\n\njq is a powerful tool for processing JSON documents. It can be used\nto search for parts of a large document with particular\ncharacteristics; transform one or many input documents into a new\noutput document; produce new documents from scratch; and more. https://stedolan.github.io/jq/\n\nAttendees will leave with a clear sense of how these tools can make\ntheir daily interactions with JSON more pleasant and efficient."
