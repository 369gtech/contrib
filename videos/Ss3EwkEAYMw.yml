description: "There are so many sophisticated ways to exploit web applications, that it’s almost impossible for a developer to write completely secure code. But we can’t accept this situation. We can’t expose our users (and our user's data) to hackers.\n\nSo what we can do? We can switch from defense to offense. We can take hacking tools, used by malicious hackers, and use them to test our web application for security issues.\n\nIn this talk, we will take a vulnerable web application, and try to find as many vulnerabilities as we can - using only automated tools. I’ll discuss the vulnerabilities we find, explain why we should care - and how we can remediate it securely. All the tools I’ll use are tools you can start using today - to scan your applications and make sure you deploy more secure applications.\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/SolutoTLV/hacking-like-a-fed\n\nYGLF 2019: Code Camp Blog, Omer Levi Hevroni:\nhttps://www.israel.yglfconf.com/post/meet-the-speaker-omer-levi-hevroni"
