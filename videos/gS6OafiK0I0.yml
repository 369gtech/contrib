title: '#HITBCyberWeek D2 LAB - Red Team Vs. Blue Team Exercises For ICS/SCADA Security'
language: English
recordingDate: 1609631303
description: "In recent years, there have been an endless stream of information security incidents in critical infrastructure areas (refining, power, smart manufacturing, etc.), and critical infrastructures in countries around the world have been attacked.\n\n\n\nThere is a considerable gap between the background knowledge of industrial control systems and information security practitioners. Often, practitioners in the industrial control field do not understand information security, and the information security practitioners do not know anything about the industrial control field.\n\n\nThis LAB will specifically target students of various backgrounds, so that they can get a glimpse of the mystery of industrial control information security.\n\n\nBased on MITRE ATT&CK for ICS, we will share and implement how to successfully obtain control of ICS from attacking industrial control protocols, and then share and implement how to detect and defend malicious attacks on these protocols.\n\n\n=== \n\n\nMars Cheng is a threat researcher for TXOne Networks, blending a background and experience in both ICS/SCADA and Enterprise cybersecurity systems. Mars has directly contributed to more than 10 CVE-IDs, and has had work published in three Science Citation Index (SCI) applied cryptography journals. Before joining TXOne, Mars was a security engineer at the Taiwan National Center for Cyber Security Technology (NCCST). Mars is a frequent speaker and trainer at several international cyber security conferences such as ICS Cyber Security Conference USA and Asia 2020, and USA 2019, HITB Lockdown 002 and Abu Dhabi 2019, SecTor 20, and HITCON 2019, as well as other conferences and seminars related to the topics of ICS and Internet of Things (IoT) security. Mars is general coordinator of HITCON 2021 and was vice general coordinator of HITCON 2020."
