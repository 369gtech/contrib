description: "Panel Discussion: Going Multi-Cloud for Realz. Stories From Media, Retail, & Infrastructure - Lisa-Marie Namphy, Portworx; Eric Han, Portworx; Umair Mufti, DreamWorks Animation; Allan Naim, Google; and Joseph Sandoval, Adobe \n\nMulti-cloud is a long-term strategy for how enterprises source infrastructure that also informs a practical approach for running across disjoint, hybrid environments. Being able to move deliver entire applications into any infrastructure requires both a mind-shift in operations and new set of tooling. It can be hard for teams to decide how to approach multi-cloud workflows, and operationalize, and push their infrastructure providers as organizations move to a multi-cloud world. This panel brings together practitioners and infrastructure providers who have built this multi-cloud world and will offer their perspective.  As a panel, we will cover: --How multi-cloud changes the development process --What gains can teams expect in the early days of multi-cloud (and how to achieve them) --What kinds of workloads are being moved --What are the best successes and worst horror stories \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPY9"
