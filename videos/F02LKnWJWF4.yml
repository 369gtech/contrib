description: "After leading 2 projects making heavy use of Lambdas and Streams, counseling many others at IBM, and teaching hundreds of developers at University and as an Independent Trainer, Victor will prove several best practices, patterns and anti-patterns he distilled over the years. All via a series of live coding exercises, like you've probably never saw in your life!\n\nYou will hear about: Bloated Lambdas, A Happy Predicate, Stream Wrecks, How to Kill The Biggest Bug, Monads, Passing-a-block, The Loan Pattern, and 5 Ways to Implement Type-Specific Logic.
