The Port Adelaide Enfield Libraries, via their STEM programs, aim to use free and open source software to produce a sustainable community resource.\r\n\r\nThis presentation will discuss the background and some of the challenges faced\r\nby the project; technologically, commercially and socially.\r\n\r\nTechnology discussed: LoRaWAN, Arduino, The Things Network, NodeRED, Graphana\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
