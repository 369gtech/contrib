description: "We have more and more devices, but we still mostly use them in isolation. In this video, you will learn how we use Polymer in research and education to experiment with applications that combine multiple devices. Maria Husmann, a PhD student at ETH Zurich, introduces the  cross-device library that she built using Polymer and demonstrates how it can be used to create a simple webcam viewer for a large screen and phones. Students at ETH Zurich have used the library for various projects (including Bachelor and Master theses) and had quickly been able to create applications with the Web Components it provides.\n\nCheck out the rest of the Polymer Summit session videos here: https://goo.gl/KuiAXd\nSubscribe to the Google Chrome Developers channel: http://goo.gl/LLLNvf"
