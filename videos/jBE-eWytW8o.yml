description: "Reason is a new, friendly syntax and toolchain for OCaml that can compile to JavaScript, OCaml bytecode or really fast native assembly code. If you've seen or used Reason before, chances are it was in a project that compiled to JavaScript, which is what the Reason community has focused the most up until now. \n\nRecently, however, the native workflow has been greatly improved and is almost, if not entirely, ready for public consumption. And you're probably curious about how to set up a project that compiles to native assembly instructions. \n\nIn this talk, I'll give you glimpse of the native landscape in Reason, and will go through all the necessary setup entailed in creating a project that compiles to native code, including managing dependencies and making the build system work to your advantage."
