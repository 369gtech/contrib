description: "Ironic: A Modern Approach to Hardware Provisioning\n\nDevananda van der Veen, HP Cloud\n\nIronic is a modern tool for hardware provisioning. Combining a RESTful API, scale-out control plane, and pluggable hardware drivers, Ironic installs operating systems efficiently and repeatably on diverse hardware.\n\nWith a vibrant community of developers, Ironic's support for the latest management technologies comes directly from hardware vendors. Meanwhile, the project ensures a consistent experience across all platforms.\n\nDevananda will demonstrate how to install Ironic with Ansible, then build and deploy a machine image, while discussing the project's architecture, history, and current goals.\n\nAttendees should be familiar with hardware provisioning standards like PXE and IPMI, but do not need deep knowledge.\n\nView the full LISA15 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa15/conference-program"
