description: "“Don't worry about the UI, we have a framework for that” they say. Then the designer's job is merely to paint over whatever product comes out of it. Does that sound frustratingly familiar?\n\nHow can we change this situation to bring user needs back in the process, while still working with an imposed framework? Let me share with you some stories from my projects, what worked but also failed. I want to help and inspire you find a collaboration process that will also work for your own teams.\n\nSlides: https://speakerdeck.com/stephaniewalter/pretty-but-not-usable\nAbout Stéphanie: https://stephaniewalter.design/\nFollow Stéphanie: https://twitter.com/walterstephanie\n\nMore about CSS Day: https://cssday.nl or https://twitter.com/cssdayconf\nReceive conference announcements in your inbox: https://cssday.nl/subscribe"
