description: "This session will explore the challenges of migrating brownfield applications to Pivotal Platform (like separation of duties, networking, and a DNS requiring heroic hacks) to tell a larger story of problem solving at the enterprise level.\n\nOver the past several months, the platform operators at The Home Depot have been working to move more than 1,000 legacy Java applications off their DIY platform to PCF. This process has presented a number of challenges and obstacles—both obvious and obscure—for this F25 enterprise. This is their story.\n\nAttendees will learn how to navigate the technical and organizational waters of application migration, as well as develop solid strategies for approaching these obstacles in their own enterprises.\n\nLearn more: https://pv.tl/35UaIzf\n\nSpeakers: Ashley Eckard, Senior Systems Engineer, The Home Depot and Michael Wright, Sr Manager, Platform Architects, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2019\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/enterprise-application-migration/Pivotal/enterprise-application-migration"
