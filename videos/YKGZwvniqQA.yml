title: 'Mobile Accessibility: Past, Present, Future! - Svetlana Kouznetsova'
recordingDate: 1574090076
description: 'Technology changes faster than accessibility guidelines can catch up, so the guidelines had to be updated several times. Currently WCAG 2.0 is going through another revision to adapt to new changes. Sveta will discuss history of web accessibility to help you better understand how it started and evolved over years and why itâ€™s important to go above and beyond the guidelines. She will explain how disabled people use mobile devices and show some accessibility examples. The speaker will also share her personal experience as a deaf professional and a mobile user. Mobile accessibility improves user experience for everyone!'
