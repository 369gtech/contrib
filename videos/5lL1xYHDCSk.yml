title: 'Clojure Versus the Botnets - Marshall Bockrath Vandegrift'
recordingDate: 1447868721
description: "Over the past three years Clojure has become Damballa's secret weapon in the fight against botnet malware. It's now our language of choice for all production data-processing, including ETL, modeling, and access microservices. Three properties of the language make it particularly suited to pragmatic data-processing applications: JVM hostedness, interactivity, and value-orientation. This experience report will describe how leveraging these properties has allowed us to rapidly develop malware-detection machine-learning pipelines which operate on literally Internet-scale data.\n\nAbout the speaker: Marshall Bockrath-Vandegrift is Principal Software Engineer for Damballa's Research and Development team. At Damballa, Marshall currently focuses on original malware-detection research and the infrastructure necessary to support that work. He is concurrently pursuing a Masters in Statistics at Georgia Tech, and lives in Atlanta, GA with his wife and two cats."
