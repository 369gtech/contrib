recordingDate: 1493314241
description: "Every proposal and estimate that comes across my desk makes me ask the question, should we do this with Drupal 8 or stick with Drupal 7. To help answer that question I will be showcasing one of our more complicated existing Drupal 7 projects and evaluate rebuilding the project with Drupal 8. I will not be going over project workflow but instead I will be focusing on changes in information architecture from Drupal 7 to Drupal 8.\n\nThe intended audience for this session is site builders/developers that have Drupal 7 experience and want to see what it takes to start building with Drupal 8. You should attend this session if any or all of the following are true:\n\nI create with Drupal 7.\nI want to create with Drupal 8.\nI want to know the differences between creating with Drupal 7 vs 8.\nI would like to know how I can leverage the new features of Drupal 8 in complicated information systems.\nThe project I will be showcasing is a true example of the power and flexibility of Drupal 7s APIs. This is a custom LMS (learning management system)\_that uses the paragraphs module to allow curriculum writers to build content with interactive components, text/multimedia components, and Q/A components that allow the users to share their responses with a community. This project has nodes that contain paragraph items that display entity forms that use flags to share (or not) entityform submissions."
