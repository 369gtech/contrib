recordingDate: 1433174899
description: "From Velocity Santa Clara 2015: We know that delivering fast, rich images to your end users will result in an increase in user engagement and have a positive impact on revenue. However, delivering rich images quickly has become more difficult as end users are demanding an image-heavy web experience. Combine this expectation with the proliferation of devices, and the task of speedily delivering a rich image experience to every user, on every device, everywhere becomes almost impossible. Some techniques have been developed to help address this problem, such as new image formats and advances in HTML5—but there exists a larger operational problem.\n\nThis presentation outlines how to deal with the expanding number of images on the web; how to eliminate the complexity of creating an image variant for every possible situation and determining when to deliver the right image variant; and finally, how to streamline the image workflow to reduce cost and increase operational efficiency.\n\nThis keynote is sponsored by Akamai.\n\nAbout Mohammed Aboul-Magd (Akamai Technologies):\nMohammed Aboul-Magd is senior product manager for Akamai’s Web Experience business unit. Prior to Akamai, Mohammed held engineering and product management leadership roles at Signiant and IBM. He was formerly the director of communications for the largest international development event in Canada, Engineers Without Borders 2012 National Conference.\n\nWatch more from the 2015 Velocity Conference: https://goo.gl/jS3T6Z\nFind out more about Velocity: http://velocityconf.com/\nDon't miss an upload!
