description: "http://www.cppcon.org\nâ€”\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2014\n--\nThis talk presents several reusable constructs from a production C++11 codebase, each of which would not be possible without C++11's new features. Auto() is what Alexandrescu's ScopeGuard looks like after a dozen years of C++ evolution. make_iterable() constructs a container from a pair of iterators, enabling simple \"foreach\" iteration over legacy containers. spaceship() is an efficient \"strcmp\" for tuples. Time permitting, we'll look at some more arcane code samples.\n--\nArthur O'Dwyer worked for many years at Green Hills Software, making the world's most optimizing C and C++ compilers. Until recently he worked at MemSQL, making the world's fastest distributed SQL database.\n--\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
