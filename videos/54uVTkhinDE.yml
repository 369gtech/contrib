title: 'Build Everything From Source: A Case Study in Fear - Dave Steffen - CppCon 2020'

description: "https://cppcon.org/\nhttps://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2020\n---\nTwo years ago Titus Winters gave a talk at Pacific++ called \"C++ Past vs. Future\" where he described the perils of linking files compiled at different times in different ways, which can easily lead to One-Definition-Rule violations and undefined behavior. This is not an abstract or theoretical problem, nor one restricted to C++, but is a present menace waiting in our build systems and in our operating system's prebuilt libraries. As a public service, I present a case study of a compiler upgrade, a deeply mysterious bug, and a popular open-source project with a C interface that cannot be delivered as a pre-built library without putting users in peril.\n\n---\nDave Steffen completed his Ph.D. in theoretical physics at Colorado State University in 2003, and promptly changed course for a career in software engineering. He has worked primarily in defence and aerospace, and is currently a technical lead at SciTec Inc.'s Boulder office. For reasons unknown, he has turned out to be the expert, champion, and occasional street-corner evangelist for unit testing at most of the companies he has ever worked at.\n\n---\nStreamed & Edited by Digital Medium Ltd - events.digital-medium.co.uk\nevents@digital-medium.co.uk"
