recordingDate: 1492195123
description: "Mux uses Apache Flink to identify anomalies in the distribution & playback of digital video for major video streaming websites. Scott Kidder will describe the Apache Flink deployment at Mux leveraging Docker, AWS Kinesis, Zookeeper, HDFS, and InfluxDB. Deploying a Flink application in a zero-downtime production environment can be tricky, so unit- & behavioral-testing, application packaging, upgrade, and monitoring strategies will be covered as well.\n\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://BashFilms.com"
