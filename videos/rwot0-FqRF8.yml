description: "Readability and Maintainability are Boring\nMac Chapman\n\nSaturday 15th, 15:30 (Assembly Room)\nA talk (25 minutes)\nIn my time, I’ve written some really exciting code: I’ve overridden nearly every operator in python and I've written logic in XML. It was a lot of fun, but it was all impossible to maintain. In this session I’ll work through some beginner to intermediate techniques for making code more predictable and manageable and share a few stories from projects past. I’ll tell you why you shouldn’t make a CSS class called “yellow”, what a variable called “noecho” really ought to do, and why you probably don’t need a variable called “noecho” anyway."
