description: "It’s been nearly 25 years since the first JavaScript engines were created and through time we’ve seen tremendous progress and proliferation of multiple architectures. As the language grew on adoption we have witnessed a steady increase on performance over time including improvements on the latest additions to the language specification. We will also focus on the current state of V8, ChakraCore, SpiderMonkey and JavaScriptCore and discuss possibilities for what lies ahead for these well-established engines.\n\n\nEVENT:\nNodeJS Interactive 2019\n\n\nSPEAKER:\nAlejandro Oviedo\n\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nThe Linux Foundation provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish NodeJS Interactive talks\n\n\nCREDITS:\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLWDUJMCoWs"
