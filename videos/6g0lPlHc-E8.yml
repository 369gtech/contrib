description: "Deep learning's explosion of spectacular results over the past few years may make it appear esoteric and daunting, but in reality, if you are familiar with traditional machine learning, you're more than ready to start exploring deep learning. This talk aims to gently bridge the divide by demonstrating how deep learning operates on core machine learning concepts and getting attendees started coding deep neural networks using Google's TensorFlow library.\n\nEVENT:\n\nPyCon 2017\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nMichelle Fullwood\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nPyCon Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video."
