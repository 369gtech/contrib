description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2012\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nSam Newman - Technical Consultant at ThoughtWorks\n\nABSTRACT\nThis talk focuses on the kinds of constraints we should consider when evolving their architecture of our systems in order to enable rapid, frequent release. So much of the conversation about Continuous Delivery focuses on the design of build pipelines, or the nuts and bolts of CI and infrastructure automation. But often the biggest constraint in being able to incrementally roll out new features are the problems in the design of the system itself. I'll be pulling together a series of patterns that will help you identify what to look for in your own systems when moving towards Continuous Delivery.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
