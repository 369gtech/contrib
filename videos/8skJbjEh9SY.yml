description: "The audio sprites idea is similar to images sprites -- it is a way to combine different files into one to get a lot of advantages like a solution for mobiles and other limited browsers, less requests and even smaller files.\n\nAll this sounds like the 'Holy Grail' of audio feature and an awesome solution to implement in any browser game or app. But is it really perfect in every case?\n\nThe Grepolis team always wants to deliver the best user experience as possible to every user -- even to browsers with their limitations. Therefore we decided to implement audio sprites in our game. In the meantime we made tests and measurements of CPU and memory usage which demonstrated a meaningful use of them -- and I wanted to show it to you.\n\nSource: http://2013.jsconf.eu/speakers/michal-biniek-html5-audio-sprites-holy-grail-or-programmers-hell.html\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
