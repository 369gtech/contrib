title: 'Math for Game Developers - Particle Simulation (Numerical Integration)'
recordingDate: 1467918000
description: "An introduction to differential equations and a review of Euler's Method of Integration, which is actually a differential equation solver. In the coding portion we discover that variable timestep can get you into trouble, so we fix our timestep to get a better simulation.\n\nhttps://github.com/BSVino/MathForGameDevelopers/tree/numerical-eulers-method\n\n\nNew video some Thursdays.
