title: '#4 e-Meetup | Randy Shoup -  “Minimal Viable Architecture”'
language: English
recordingDate: 1587383259
description: 'Most applications start as a monolith, most should stay that way; only a minority of them need something like microservices. We''ll talk about understanding what phase our product is in, and how to make a principled decision about the kind of architecture we need. Successful companies architect for the problems they have, not the problems they *want* to have!'
