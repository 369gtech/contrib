description: "Learn Live: Foundations of Data Science for Machine Learning - Measure and optimize model performance with ROC and AUC: November 9 – Episode 09\n\nJoin the chat and ask questions live at https://aka.ms/LearnLiveTV\n\nStarting Tuesday, September 14, 2021 (PST), join Jason DeBoever and Glenn Stephens live on Learn TV and explore this nine-part “Foundations of data science for machine learning” series. Each week, we will be walking through Learn modules and answering your questions live. From basic classical machine learning models to exploratory data analysis and customizing architectures, you’ll be guided by easy to digest conceptual content and interactive Jupyter notebooks and will learn about the underlying concepts as well as how to get into building models with the most common machine learning tools.\n\nNovember 9 - Episode 9:\nFollow along and complete the free, hands-on Microsoft Learn modules at https://aka.ms/LearnML-OptimizePerformance\n\nReceiver operator characteristic curves are a powerful way to assess and fine-tune trained classification models. We introduce and explain the utility of these curves through learning content and practical exercises. In this episode, you will:\n\nUnderstand how to create ROC curves.\nExplore how to assess and compare models using these curves.\nPractice fine-tuning a model using characteristics plotted on ROC curves.\n\nMiss an episode?
