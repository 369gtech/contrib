description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io\n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nDeep Dive: CNCF Storage WG - Xing Yang & Quinton Hoole, Huawei\n\nThe CNCF Storage Working Group has been exploring how different storage technologies are used in cloud-native environments, and has published a draft white paper on our findings.  In this deep dive session we'll present our work thus far, and host detailed discussions and feedback covering topics including block stores, file systems, object stores, key-value stores and databases, amongst others. Common understandings of terminology, classifications and use cases will be discussed. Different architectural approaches and designs will be brainstormed and compared in terms of key attributes like availability, scalability, performance, data consistency, durability, fault tolerance, ease of development and operational complexity. We seek to align the community on common understanding, terminology, classifications and use cases.\n\nTo learn more click here: https://sched.co/H1WC"
