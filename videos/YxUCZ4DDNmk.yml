description: "Slides and more info: http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2016/lech-glowiak\n\nFrege is a Haskell for JVM. It has most of Haskell lovely features: succinct syntax, functional purity, lazy evaluation, pattern matching, algebraic data types and powerful type system. Frege is JVM language: it translates Haskell like source files into highly annotated Java source code. Frege is interoperable with other JVM languages: one can use existing JVM libraries thanks to 'native' declarations and because it compiles to Java, code written in Frege can be used from other JVM languages as well.  This session will be going step by step from downloaded Frege distribution to running JSONLint web service, but in a way allowing explanation of the most important topics for newcomers. Both Frege and generated Java code will be commented wherever possible. Necessary and helpful tooling will be used: REPL for prototyping, 'native-gen' for wrapping libraries and plugins for Gradle, Leiningen and sbt will be covered."
