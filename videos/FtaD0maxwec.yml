description: "http://www.Cppcon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2015\n—\nIn this talk we will describe a new concurrency control algorithm with Blocking write operations and Wait-Free Population Oblivious read operations, which we named the Left-Right algorithm.\n\nWe will show a new pattern where this algorithm is applied, which requires using two instances of a given resource, and can be used for any data structure, allowing concurrent access to it similarly to a Reader-Writer lock, but in a non-blocking manner for reads, including safe memory management without needing a Garbage Collector.\n— \nPedro has a PhD in Particle Physics for research done at CERN. Most of the research itself required programming in C++, and I also had a major participation in the coding of the experiment's data acquisition and decoding software in C and C++. I'm currently working at Cisco writing networking software, with emphasis on real-time concurrent synchronization techniques, and wait-free/lock-free data structures.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
