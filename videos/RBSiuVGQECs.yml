description: "Google Tech Talk\nFebruary 12, 2013\nMore info below\n\nPresented by Jason Kunesh\n\nABSTRACT\n\nBeing the first director of user experience in US Presidential campaign history presented a unique set of challenges, goals, and constraints. I'll share best practices and methods that helped us mock up great prototypes quickly to help Obama for America build winning social, mobile, e-commerce and in person experiences. Hear how we applied community organizing principles learned from the field organization to build consensus and esprit de corps with campaign HQ. Tall tales & plenty of QA to go around.\n\nSPEAKER INFO\n\nJason Kunesh most recently performed as Director of User Experience & Product at Obama for America. You can find him advocating for elegant, simple solutions to gnarly problems wherever people meet technology. He's at his best when helping people work together using sketches on whiteboards and real-life prototypes to communicate ideas.\n\nPrior to the campaign Jason founded and led design firm Fuzzy Math in Chicago. In a long and varied career he has been fortunate to work with lots of awesome organizations including: the Chicago Field Museum, Giant Bike, IBM, Jabber, LeapFrog, Lockheed Martin, the Mayo Clinic, Microsoft, Orbitz, ThePoint/Groupon, Threadless, United Airlines, and bunches more you've never heard of. His passion for design has led him to professorial stints at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and DePaul University."
