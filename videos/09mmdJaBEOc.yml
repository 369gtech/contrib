title: 'Building a real-time serverless app in Blazor using AWS'
language: English
recordingDate: 1613119577
description: "In this session, we will build an interactive dashboard using Blazor.\n\nA dashboard that reacts in real-time to events that happen in the real world. We will connect the Blazor application through to a serverless backend built in .Net.\n\nRather than requiring a cluster of servers to maintain our WebSocket communications, we will use a managed service called Amazon API Gateway and take advantage of it's WebSockets support.\n\nThis service introduces a whole new way of thinking about, and architecting, applications that require duplex communication.\n\nBy the end of the session, you will have the knowledge to build highly scalable and resilient real-time applications without having to manage or scale servers.\n\n## About Martin\n\nI’ve been a developer since I was 16. Having no garage, unlike my American counterparts, I began developing small sites, apps and hacks from the comfort of my bedroom.\n\nMy focus back then was pretty much the same as it is now – finding new ways of solving annoying problems. Early on, this involved discovering how to send SMS messages for free by piggybacking on a service owned by HMV. (This was back when an SMS could cost up to 30p.)\n\nThe resulting service – ZipSMS – grew to capture around 1% of all texts sent each day. It also captured HMV’s attention and, while they were surprisingly good about it, ultimately this meant the demise of that particular brainchild.\n\nSince then, my career has followed roughly the same path – find stuff that needs fixing and then use technology to fix it.\n\n## Agenda\n\n19:15: Zoom call - A quick bit of networking/chat\n19:30 nor(DEV): Introduction - Begin recording & streaming to YouTube Live.\n19:35 Speaker Slot\n20:20 Q&A\n20:30 Close...
