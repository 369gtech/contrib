title: 'Matt Digan: Moving to a House in the Clouds - Our New Data Infrastructure and Lessons We Learned'
recordingDate: 1542726902
description: 'The New York Times data engineering team revitalized its data warehouse with cloud services. We built a new home for our customer data on Google Cloud Platform and moved out of our 15 year old data warehouse. Our data engineers are now able to focus on data flow, data quality, and data governance instead of operations, and analysts and data scientists can enjoy less complicated interactions with large datasets. There were challenges with managing a long project with many system and process dependencies, changing the skills and composition of the team, and keeping the old system functioning well while building the new one. Establishing and staying within our budget during development and while in production was also a concern. Our story will be of interest to those who are considering a move to new technologies, languages, and skills, as well as others who are looking to gain flexibility and take advantage of innovations in cloud services. - Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/crunch'
