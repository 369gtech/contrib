recordingDate: 1449594410
description: "With the rapid adoption of Apache Spark—one of the most active Apache projects today—and the need for programs to span many machines to solve the world’s greatest problems, distributed computing has resurfaced as a hot commodity that can take your career to the next level and—more important—that can open the door to some really cool and impactful apps. The goal of this presentation is to introduce Java and Scala developers to basic Spark concepts such as DAGs, RDDs, transformations, actions, and executors. Attendees will also learn how their mindset must evolve beyond Java or Scala code that runs in a single JVM and will explore JVM locality, memory utilization, network/CPU usage, optimization of DAGs pipelines, and serialization conservation.\n\nSpeaker:\nTed Malaska, Principal Solution Architect, Cloudera\nTed Malaska is a Solutions Architect at Cloudera, and a co-author of the O’Reilly book, Hadoop Applications Architecture. He has 18 years of experience working for startups, the US government, a number of the world's largest banks, and the US’s largest non-profit financial regulator. Ted is a regular committer to Apache Flume, Apache Avro, Apache Pig, and Apache Hadoop."
