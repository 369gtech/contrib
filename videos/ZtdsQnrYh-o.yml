title: '"Introduction to Linux''s License" - Bradley M. Kuhn (LCA 2020)'
recordingDate: 1578986922
description: "Bradley M. Kuhn\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/184/\n\nLinux developers must know the basics of licensing. In particular, developers will encounter issues, questions, concerns & discussions about Linux's license, the GNU General Public License, version 2 (GPLv2) throughout their careers. This tutorial gives the most basic introduction to GPLv2, the basics of its history, how it perceived both within and without the Linux community, and what managers, executives, & legal departments will ask developers to do about licensing. Most importantly, the nuances of GPLv2's requirements for \"scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable\", which are often more complicated for embedded systems, are carefully explained, as are the known additional permissions available beyond GPLv2 for Linux. Successful students will be ready to converse intelligently in licensing conversations in their companies and in the community.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
