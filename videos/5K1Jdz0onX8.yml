description: 'Open, honest, and safe conversations can be very difficult but they''re also healthy and essential. Making change requires intentionality, patience, listening but most importantly trust. In this keynote Clark chats with a panel of amazing women, women who have inspired him, women who are trying to make real change in our community. Women who put themselves out there to help each and every day. We''re going to explore some of their daily challenges and more importantly understand what changes we all can instill in our daily actives. We can always be a better version of ourselves, and together we can be a stronger THAT.'
