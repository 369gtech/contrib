language: English
recordingDate: 1565615066
description: "Currently only ‘fs’ and ‘dns’ have an experimental promise api in Node core. People LOL at node.js core modules for still using the callback pattern. I could launch into a bunch of puns here but instead I’ll just say the current status is sad but fixable. Where are we? What do we need to do? How can you help?\n\nFootnotes: https://twitter.com/MylesBorins/status/1064925041039761409 https://twitter.com/cramforce/status/1064734275478577152\n\nhttps://2019.jsconf.eu/joe-sepi/promises-api-in-nodejs-core-where-we-are-and-where-well-get-to.html"
