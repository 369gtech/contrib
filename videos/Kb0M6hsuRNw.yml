description: 'Performance tests are a tough topic, especially nowadays with micro services architectures, clusters and very complex systems. In the first part of the presentation, I would like to address the most common problems and errors in this area. Share my experiences often gained by frustrating failures and demanding experiments. After this lovely introduction, I will show you - why it''s worth to spend some time and learn a new tool for integrating and performance test such as Gatling? - under what circumstances it will be extremely useful to have it in your toolbox? - what are Gatling cons and what kind of problems can you expect?'
