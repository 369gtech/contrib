description: "Foundations sound horribly boring, but if you love building and using open source software, they're actually really cool.\n\nI've been the executive director of the .NET Foundation since February, and one of my most difficult tasks when I was first starting was figuring out how to describe what the .NET Foundation actually is, let alone why anyone should actually care.Foundations can do a lot for the community, and maybe for your open source project. After getting you hyped out of your minds on what software foundations do for you today, we'll talk about where they could possibly go tomorrow."
