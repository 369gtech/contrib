description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nLSM BPF Change Everything - Leonardo Di Donato, Elastic & KP Singh, Google\n\nMuch is being said on security recently. Almost as much was said about tracing the syscalls happening in the Linux Kernel with BPF. Aside from all the buzz, we need to appraise some gaps in the current narrative. We need to fill in the gaps in the actual syscall execution flow to avoid attackers using them. Here enters the game the general security hooks for Linux, namely LSMs, and their integration with BPF. LSMs via BPF will change everything. They're still relatively unexplored, so this talk aims at giving a pragmatic overview of LSMs via BPF. Join me to discover why I believe their integration with BPF is paramount in the security context and how to effectively use them."
