description: "As technology and design becomes increasingly powerful and central to human life, it’s never been more critical to offer compelling experiences that deliver long-term value. In order to successfully build these experiences, we need to craft the right product design process that incorporates user values and quality as well as business impact and velocity into our practice. And, most importantly, we need to build a strong design-driven culture that integrates user experience design into product decision making and inspires teams to go above and beyond.\n\nIn this talk, Basak will dig deeper into the new era of design culture that evolves around courage, values, and innovation and discuss ways to accelerate the product design process thoughtfully and maximize design maturity in organizations.\n\nAbout Başak: http://www.helloitsmebasak.com/\nFollow Başak: https://twitter.com/bashakalakha\n\nMore about CSS Day: https://cssday.nl or https://twitter.com/cssdayconf\nReceive conference announcements in your inbox: https://cssday.nl/subscribe"
