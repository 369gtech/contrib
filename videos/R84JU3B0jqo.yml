You need to know a lot of math, understand how to write shaders and integrate the well known JavaScript world with the WebGL concepts, just to get started, or commit yourself to a 3D framework (e.g Unity).\n\nThree.js is a library which wraps all the WebGL concepts in a simple API, so you can program in JavaScript, and easily create great looking 3D scenes. Three.js comes with a large set of lights and materials, supports animations, and can load most 3D formats. It even has supports for VR and AR.\n\nIn this session we'll walk you through the main concepts of Three.js, and show you how easy it is to create great looking and complex 3D scenes, which work in mobile and desktop browers, react-native and even support ArCore and ArKit. All through a couple lines of JavaScript.\n\nJos Dirksen \nFrom Smartjava\nI've worked as a software developer and architect for more than a decade. Besides working I like talking and writing about technologies. I've written a couple of books on Scala, REST, D3 and Three.js and currently work as a fullstack engineer on a Scala and React project.\n\nI'm a big fan of creating data visualisations using D3 and Three.js, since they provide a great set of tools to make sense of data. A number of the stuff I created can be seen on my blog at http://www.smartjava.org.\n\nBasically I like talking, writing and discussing about technology. Whether it is frontend, backend or DevOps and cloud related."
