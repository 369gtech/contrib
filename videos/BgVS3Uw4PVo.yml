description: "Study on Human Factors and Team Culture to Improve Pager Fatigue\n\nDaria Barteneva, Microsoft\n\nNoisy pagers can lead to pager fatigue, but noisiness is a subjective idea: every team will have their own answer as to how many alerts lead to a noisy pager. There's an assumption that more must mean worse. That led me to wonder: does the number of pages correlate to on-call satisfaction? In this talk, we will look at the results of the study that confirms that a higher number of pages doesn't correlate with on-call satisfaction. The sense of agency to improve the on-call experience and drive the change in a collaborative manner had a stronger impact on team morale than just a number of pages. We will look at different aspects of team culture that have a high impact on engineers' on-call satisfaction and discuss behavioral patterns that contribute to a positive on-call experience.\n\nView the full SREcon20 Americas program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon20americas/program"
