recordingDate: 1363190992
description: "Erik Osheim, Senior R&D Engineer at Precog, delivers a talk focusing on low-level optimization in Scala and strategies to help the JVM run faster. Sounds simple enough, but as Erik mentions it often gets more complicated.\n\nThis talk, for the Northeast Scala Symposium, provides tips to avoid \"premature optimization.\" John address, and creates solutions for, many issues that can arise. Some of these topics include: \n\nHotSpots\nArrays\nSpecialization successes (& failures)\nBoxing & GC pressure\nInlining limitations\nReading Java Bytecode\nProfiling & benchmarking\n\n** Visit our site for more content on Scala, including the rest of the presentations from NE Scala 2013: http://marakana.com/s/tags/scala"
