description: "Creators of cloud-native web applications and products often try to optimize for scarce computational resources — memory, network bandwidth, and CPU cycles. But increasingly, there's another scarce resource we should be prioritizing: our attention.\n\nIn this talk, I'll show how to improve common patterns in how we present data and information to our users, and to ourselves, to optimize for attention. More intriguingly, we'll see how small changes to interfaces and data presentation can lead users to very different conclusions on the information they're shown. By the end of the talk, we'll hopefully have convinced you that happier and more informed users isn't just a good outcome, but rather is the most ethical thing to do if we don't want to lead users astray.\n\n\nSlides: TBA\n\nJohn Feminella, Advisory Engineer, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2017"
