description: "The revolution is coming, and it won't be televisedâ€”but it will be in your browser. In fact, it's already here. It's called WebAssembly, and it's a new standard that's already having big consequences for how we author code for the Web. \n\nLearn more: https://pv.tl/2OZbK74\n\nAbstract: In this talk, we'll explore the sweeping ramifications of WebAssembly on the way forward-thinking organizations are writing software. We'll review how it works and what's unique to WebAssembly as an environment and execution framework. We'll dig into specific architectures and explore what kinds of new approaches are made possible in this new world. \n\nBy the end of the talk, you should feel well-equipped to treat the web as a platform, and understand how to bring the WebAssembly approach back to your own applications.\n\nSpeaker: John Feminella; Principal Advisor, Pivotal\n\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2019\n\nSlides: Coming soon\n\nJohn Feminella:"
