description: "Crypto-kitties! I'm going to cover the most important parts of the popular crypto-kitties game built on the Ethereum blockchain in this video. The game is over 2000 lines of Solidity code and it allows players to buy, sell, and breed these collectible cats. At one point, this game accounted for a third of transactions on the Ethereum network which is absolutely insane. This is a great example of a wildly popular use case for a decentralized application. There is a lot of potential here to make a game that people obsess over and makes both the creators and players a good amount of money.
