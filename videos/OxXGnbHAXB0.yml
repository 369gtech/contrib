description: "In our series Inside Azure Service Fabric (http://aks.ms/InsideSF) you've learned the gory details of Service Fabric's design and implementation directly from the engineers behind the various subsystems that comprise Service Fabric. \n\nIn our new series, Outside Azure Service Fabric, you'll learn about the technologies that are built on top of Service Fabric. First up is Azure Event Hubs (https://azure.microsoft.com/services/event-hubs/), a cloud service that enables secure continuous ingestion of data from hundreds of thousands of sources with low latency and configurable time retention, handling about 2 trillion events per day at latest count. Wow! \n\nMeet Cesar Ruiz-Meraz, Development Manager of the Event Hubs engineering team. He digs into how Event Hubs is designed, what the technology affords customers, and how his team leveraged the power of Service Fabric to pull off a cloud-scale service that processes trillions of events a day. \n\nTune in and learn!"
