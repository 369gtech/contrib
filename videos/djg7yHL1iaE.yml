In particular, we identify what legislations might help place AI at the service of the urgently needed solutions for today's various crises, with the overall aim, as K. Raworth put it, to \"\"meet the needs of all within the means of the planet\"\".\n\nSlides & full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/veronica-dahl/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - VERONICA DAHL\nLogic programming co-founder\n\nVer√≥nica Dahl is an Argentine/Canadian mother, computer scientist, musician, and writer. She co-founded the Logic Programming field with 14 other scientists and made pioneering contributions to human languages processing, computational molecular biology, constraint programming and knowledge-based systems. She received numerous awards for her scientific results in AI, and three first prizes for her literary work. Her research program is supported by NSERC. Her greatest scientific ambition is to help bridge the gap between the formal and the humanistic sciences, for a more balanced and ethical world.\n\nMore on Veronica Dahl: https://codesync.global/speaker/veronica-dahl/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE MESH LDN 19\nCode Mesh LDN is powered by Code Sync.
