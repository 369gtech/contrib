description: "Watch a security expert hacking a serverless app!\n\nServerless means handing off server management to the cloud platforms - along with their security risks. With the \"pros\" ensuring our servers are patched, what's left for Node.js developers to protect? As it turns out, quite a lot. This talk discusses the aspects of security serverless doesn't solve, the problems it could make worse, and the tools and practices you can use to keep your serverless Node.js applications safe.\n\nEVENT: Node Summit 2017\n\nPERMISSIONS: Event organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nNode Summit web-site: http://www.nodesummit.com/\nSnyk web-site: https://snyk.io/"
