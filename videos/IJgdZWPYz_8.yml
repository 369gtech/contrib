description: "by Paul Boven\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/AW1.120/sdr_dwingeloo.webm\n\n\nThe Dwingeloo radio telescope is a historic instrument in the Netherlands. At its opening in 1956, the 25m dish was the largest fully steerable radio telescope in the world. These days it is run by a group of volunteers, who have restored and rejuvenated the instrument. It is used for radio astronomy and amateur radio, but also for outreach and art projects, to name a few of our activities. \n\nWe perform observations of pulsars, the hydrogen line of our own Milky Way and other galaxies, have a SETI project, and have recently participated in our first VLBI observation. We are increasingly using Software Defined Radio and in particular GNU Radio to perform our measurements. This allows for rapid development of new signal processing chains, and a lot of flexibility in how we process the incoming data. \n\nIn this presentation I will present some of the signal processing that is useful for radio astronomy, the flowcharts we have developed, and the astronomical results that we obtain with them. Contents: \n\n\nVery short introduction to Radio Astronomy \nThe Dwingeloo Telescope and CAMRAS \nPre GNU Radio: a home-built FPGA based astronomy backend / SDR \nReceiving Pulsars \nThe Hydrogen Line \nReceiving GPS \nTeaching the backend to speak to GR \nSpectrum recording and WOLA \nPulsars, again \nDSLWP-B \nSETI \nWhite Rabbit \nVLBI \n\n\n\nRoom: AW1.120\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 15:00:00+01"
