description: "by Karsten Thoms\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/UD2.119/eclipse_tuning_2019.webm\n\n\nWhile increasing amount of features usually result in poorer performance and more memory consumption, Eclipse Photon has proven the opposite: The Eclipse Platform got faster and less memory hungry than before. This has been achieved by intensive profiling of multiple use cases and refactorings derived from the analysis. \n\nThis talk will take a look behind the scenes and shows how profiling tools can help to understand performance bottlenecks in Eclipse based products and Java applications in general. Attendees will learn about the YourKit Java Profiler tool, which while being a commercial product can be used for free on Open Source development. I will discuss some former hot spots identified in the Eclipse platform with analysis screenshots and how they got resolved. \n\nRoom: UD2.119\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 13:35:00+01"
