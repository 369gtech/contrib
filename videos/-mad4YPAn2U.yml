recordingDate: 1466735807
description: "In this video we tie together a lot of the concepts from previous videos e.g. arc-length, newton's method, and simpson's rule, to produce a constant-speed reparameterization of cubic splines.\n\nhttps://github.com/BSVino/MathForGameDevelopers/tree/numerical-constant-speed-splines\n\nNew video some Thursdays.
