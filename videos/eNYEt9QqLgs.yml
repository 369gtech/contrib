description: "Open Service Broker 101: That Extra Something - Christian Brinker, evoila\n\nWhile building up a productive Cloud Foundry Application Runtime and Container Runtime one soon realizes that making use of solely the core components of Cloud Foundry Application Runtime and Container Runtime will not realize the platforms objective by itself - to speed up the software development by standardization.\n\nTo that the platforms only provide a standardized runtime environment without the other necessary components required by a productive environment of software systems like databases, message queues or log aggregators. But these also have to be provided in a standardized and fast way to speed up a software development process. The solution is called ‘Service Broker’.\n\nIn his talk, Christian Brinker takes the audience on the journey from the reasons for the usage of service brokers via their inner structure and effects to complex production setups. He presents common pitfalls and best practices as well as giving a deep insight in the open source service broker framework of his team. Thereby he enlightens common problems like remote controlled load balancers, service key management or on-premise deployment of complex database clusters. \n\nAdditionallly, he talks about how to run Kubernetes and Cloud Foundry next to another using the same service brokers and how to share service instances (e.g. a database) between both environments.\n\nAbout Christian Brinker\nAs long-standing member of the evoila PaaS team Christian Brinker is well experienced in the automation of cloud environments. His focus is the development of software architectures in customized XaaS solutions. \n\nHe developed many solutions in and for the Cloud Foundry ecosystem, like service brokers or complex billing systems for Cloud Foundry and OpenStack. \n\nOn the CF Summit Europe 2016, 2017 and as well as North America 2018 he presented his teams work e.g. on a service broker framework. At the CF Summit Europe 2017 and 2018 he was track co-chair of the cloud & microservices track and the operations & security track and his teams won both hackathons. He is also ambassador of the Cloud Foundry foundation. Additionally he gained broad experience as a data scientist resulting in publications and presentations on international conferences. \n\nChristian Brinker works at an agile, German-based cloud engineering and consulting company.
