description: "Speaker: Kirk Kaiser\n\nIn the past few years, the power of computer vision has exploded. In this talk, we'll apply a deep learning model to a bird feeder. We'll use that model to detect, identify, and record birds that come to a smart bird feeder.\n\nAlong the way, we'll learn about different platforms to deploy deep learning cameras on, from the lowly Raspberry PI all the way up to the powerful NVIDIA Jetson embedded computer with a built in GPU.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2018 and https://github.com/PyCon/2018-slides"
