language: English
recordingDate: 1493218955
description: "In a fast developing industry such as tech, the acquisition and retention of talent is a crucial success factor. Often, hiring through personal networks can lead to a quicker and more successful hiring process than traditional methods – and sometimes contacts can even encourage under-represented groups to apply for positions they wouldn’t consider otherwise. But there’s a downside: personal networks are significantly different in size, structure and utilisation depending on a person’s social origin and gender. Does hiring through networks lead to an exclusion of whole social classes? Do contacts influence retention time positively for men yet not for women?\n\nThis talk presents current research results and provides suggestions on how to tackle talent acquisition in tech without giving up on representation and diversity.\n\nABOUT YASMINA BANASZCZUK\n\nYasmina has recently completed her PhD on networks and career entry and has been working as a strategic consultant for NGOs and start ups on diversity and community and employee management.\n\nShe loves what she does and she loves challenging people’s perception of things.\n\nYasmina lives in Berlin and is still trying to figure out this city - but she loves the internationality here. She’s a passionate player of all kinds of games – video and board alike – and a dedicated coffee lover."
