description: "Speaking the Same Language\n\nAs Designers we are comfortable with the concept that design is about communicating content or intent in the easiest way possible for the audience. Yet, as Design Professionals we often find it hard to communicate with the Non-Design Professionals we work with… and it gets harder the further up the ladder we go and often when Designers reach leadership level, we are ill equipped to have the most optimised, most constructive conversation with other leaders. In this talk I will explore some of the challenges I’ve faced working across agencies, consultancies and software companies.\n\nAbout the speaker: \nRobert Fransgaard http://www.fransgaard.com – VP Experience Design at Sage. Previously Salesforce, IBM and Burberry\n\nAbout the conference:\nAt The UX Conference on February 20th 2018 in London we were exploring how to improve collaboration between designers and business stakeholders. The event was organised by The School of UX http://schoolofux.com and kindly supported by Balsamiq, TestingTime, Axure, Loop11, UsabilityHub, Optimal Workshop and Proto.io.
