recordingDate: 1486944825
description: "We are steeped in data…broad in scope, deep in meaning, and utterly complex. Can this treasure trove be transformed to illuminate ideas without being overwhelming? Or boring? Can we create emotive experiences for the audience with just data?\n\nThe premise is simple: How can we use the lessons from 100 years of cinematography to regain the power of persuasion and bring life to information, making them more like movies where data is the storyteller and you the director?\n\nWe will take you along our journey that resulted in Perspective, an app used by the world’s top presenters to convey the true meaning behind their data.\n\nFarshad Nayeri is the Founder & CEO of Pixxa, where he leads the development of Perspective. Perspective helps presenters use the tablet to tell stories that convey the true meaning behind their data. Before Pixxa, Farshad led the development of software products and Apps for 15 years, resulting in millions of downloads and a few trips to AppStore’s Top Apps.\n\nFor more on YOW!
