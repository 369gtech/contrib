description: "DevOps Gathering 2017 | \"One year monitoring a small startup with Prometheus\" by Maykel Moya (ShuttleCloud)\n\nTwitter Conference: https://twitter.com/DevOpsGathering\nTwitter Organizer: https://twitter.com/bee42solutions\nWebsite Conference: https://devops-gathering.io/\nWebsite Organizer: https://bee42.com\n\n***\nShuttleCloud is a small startup specialized in migrating email and contacts at scale, proud of having Google among its customers. We migrated our primitive monitoring to Prometheus one year ago and the switch have proved being cost-effective.\nIn this talk I’ll present our monitoring infrastructure, the instrumentation and operational challenges we have faced and some good/bad monitoring patterns we’ve learned down the road.\n\n***\nTwitter Conference: https://twitter.com/DevOpsGathering\nTwitter Organizer: https://twitter.com/bee42solutions\nWebsite Conference: https://devops-gathering.io/\nWebsite Organizer: https://bee42.com"
