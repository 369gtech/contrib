description: "Wikipedia and the Lean Data Diet\n\nNuria Ruiz, Principal Engineer, Wikimedia Foundation\n\nPrivacy is one of the lesser known charms of Wikipedia. Wikipediaâ€™s stand on privacy allows users to access and modify a wiki in anonymity, without fear of giving away personal information, editorship or browsing history. In this talk we will go into the challenges that this strong privacy stance poses for the Wikimedia Foundation, including how it affects data collection and some creative workarounds that allow WMF to calculate metrics in a privacy conscious way.\n\nView the full PEPR '20 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/pepr20/conference-program"
