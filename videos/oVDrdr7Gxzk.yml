description: "There's more to synchronizing your Power Apps data than timers and polling! With the Azure SignalR Service and a couple Azure Functions and a single Power Apps component framework component, your apps can be communicating with each other in real timeâ€”your users can be communicating with each other in real time, and you or your org's app makers can put it all together with just a few lines of Power Apps code! We'll walk through standing it all up, and walk through a Power Apps demo built on top of it all.\n\nAdditional Resources:\nAzure SignalR Service: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/signalr-service/?WT.mc_id=powerfuldevs-c9-donasa\nAn introduction to Azure Functions: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview?WT.mc_id=powerfuldevs-c9-donasa\nPower Apps component framework overview: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/developer/component-framework/overview?WT.mc_id=powerfuldevs-c9-donasa"
