description: "Speaker(s):\nChristian Robertson, Jon Wiley, Jonathan Lee, Matias Duarte, Nicholas Jitkoff\n\nDescription:\nFormerly titled \"Cross-platform design\"\n\nDesign is the art of considered creation. As designers, our goal is to satisfy the diverse spectrum of human needs. As those needs evolve, so too must our designs, practices, and philosophies.\n\nWe challenged ourselves to create a visual language for our users that synthesizes the classic principles of good design with the innovation and possibility of technology and science. The result is material design: a cross-platform design system grounded in tactile reality, inspired by our study of paper and ink, yet open to imagination and magic.\n\nIn this session, design leads across Google discuss the key principles of material design, and set the stage for the later sessions focusing on interaction, motion and visual design.\n\nWatch all Google I/O 2014 videos at: g.co/io14videos"
