description: "PyData Berlin 2018\n\nThis talk will provide useful and practical understanding on how to build industry-ready machine learning pipelines in python through distributed, horizontally-scalable architectures. This talk will also go into detail on the motivations for such architectures, the technologies required, best practices, caveats and practical use-cases in industry.\n\nSlides: https://axsauze.github.io/industrial-machine-learning/#/\n---\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
