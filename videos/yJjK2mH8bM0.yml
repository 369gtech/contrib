description: "During a vacation, I have wanted to play a blitz chess game with a friend. We only had a chess board with us, but no chess clock. We looked for Android apps online, but none satisfied us.\n\nHence, in February 2017 I have started writing a chess clock app for Android. In the beginning, the app got 0 to 5 installs per day. With time and some tricks, more and more user installed it.\n\nNow after almost two years 400 to 650 new users are installing the app every day; without a single dime spent on marketing. Daily active users are around 1500, weekly around 8500, monthly around 27000 users and it keeps on growing.\nI will walk you through my journey step by step. Everything started with research. Development of the app was next. Followed by user acquisition.\n\nMany tricks and tools have helped me to stay sane and focus along the way and will help you in making your application more successful too."
