description: "Yo my good friends, I'm here with another CSS for beginners tutorial. And in the lesson we're going to learn all about the nth-of-type pseudo classes! Nth of type classes are a great fall-back option when you just can't get nth-child to work, because they disregard elements that are not of the type you are targeting. Anyway, have fun, peace & keep coding :).\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO CHANNEL - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n========== CSS for Beginners Playlist ==========\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gQeDH6xYhmO-db2mhoTSrT\n========== HTML Basics Course ==========\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9ibZ2TSBaGGNrgh4ZgYE6Cc\n\n========== The Net Ninja ============\n\nFor more front-end development tutorials & to black-belt your coding skills, head over to - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg or http://thenetninja.co.uk\n\n========== Social Links ==========\n\nTwitter - @TheNetNinja - https://twitter.com/thenetninjauk"
