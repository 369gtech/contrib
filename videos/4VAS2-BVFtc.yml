language: English
recordingDate: 1630491795
description: "IDA2Obj is a tool I created that allows you to directly dump multiple object files just from one executable binary (exe, dll, etc) â€“ The tool is designed mainly for Static Binary Instrumentation to collect code coverage and integrates with popular fuzzing engines (AFL, honggfuzz, etc). Based on my testing, it is faster than all of the DBI solutions currently available.\n\nIn this presentation I will share:\n\n    How I implemented the tool start from scratch.\n    The challenges I met along the way and how I overcame them\n    How to integrate IDA2Obj with fuzzing engines\n    A demo of the tool being used\n\n===\n\nMickey Jin (@patch1t) works for Trend Micro as a malware analyst and a vulnerability hunter. He enjoys analyzing root cause of all kinds of wierd issues through reversing and debugging. He is the first man who discover the 0 day tricks used by Mac Malware XCSSET. He started to dig 0 day vulnerabilities since last year, and currently he has submitted 80+ vulnerabilities to ZDI and got 50+ CVE acknowledgements from Apple, Google."
