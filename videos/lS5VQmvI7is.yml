description: "This video was recorded at the virtual Code BEAM V Europe conference, which took place on 19-21st May 2021 - https://codesync.global/conferences/code-beam-sto-2021/\n\nMore great virtual tech conferences - https://codesync.global​ \n\n---\n\nKeynote:  Panel on Machine Learning on the BEAM by José Valim, Randall Thomas, David Lucia, Garrett Smith, Svetlana Levitan\n\n\nABSTRACT\nMachine learning is a method of programming where software is generated by other software. It's taught, or \"learned\" using examples, statistics, and iterative improvements to create useful functions. Nx, Axon, and other projects in Elixir and Erlang are bringing the benefits of machine learning to the BEAM. In this discussion, a panel of machine learning experts consider recent development in ML and BEAM languages and explore future work to help release the promise of machine learning for scalable, fault tolerant systems. If you're new to machine learning or a seasoned expert, this discussion will bring you up to speed on ML and the BEAM and will inspire your work in data-enabled application development.\n\n---\n\nSPEAKER - José Valim\nJosé Valim is the creator of the Elixir programming language. He and his team at Dashbit help startups and enterprises adopt and run Elixir in production while contributing to the ecosystem through sustainable Open Source.\n\nSPEAKER - Randall Thomas\nandall Thomas (@daksis) is a classically trained musician that took one too many calculus classes and got sucked into geekery: computers, robots, video games, high energy physics - the usual suspects.\nAfflicted with rabid technology ADD, Randall has built companies in various industries with numerous startups -- everything from robotics to digital video to cloud computing. After escaping a high-security military prison and driving a heavily armed conversion van filled with ex spec-ops soldiers for hire around the Los Angeles underground,\n\nSPEAKER - David Lucia\nDave is VP, Engineering at Simplebet, a sports technology company whose mission is to power to future of fan engagement. While at Simplebet, Dave has worked with many amazing engineers building services that run on the BEAM. In an early architecture iteration, Dave helped build a Rust Machine Learning framework that was deployed as an Elixir NIF that powered Simplebet's MLB predictions. They have long since moved away from the Rust NIF, in favor of a more standard Python ML stack, orchestrated by Elixir.\n\nWhile not glued to VIM in Emacs, Dave spends his time in NY with his wife and son, and their two Pomeranians, Pearl and Shy Guy.\n\nSPEAKER - Garrett Smith\nGarrett Smith is the founder of Guild AI, an open source package management and automation tool for machine learning models. Garrett specialises in AI application development, bringing together experts in statistics, deep learning, programming, accelerated computing and operations. \n\nPrior to founding Guild AI, Garrett led the PaaS division at CloudBees, which hosted tens of thousands of production applications and databases. Garrett is a frequent speaker and instructor in the fields of AI and software engineering.\n\nSPEAKER - Svetlana Levitan\nSvetlana is now a Principal Algorithms and Machine Learning Scientist at Walgreens Co. She worked as a senior software engineer implementing SPSS statistical and ML algorithms at SPSS and IBM for 18 years. More recently Svetlana worked as a developer advocate at IBM with a focus on ML, open source, open standards, and as a Senior Data Scientist at CattleScan, a startup in Toronto. Svetlana played a leading role in several releases of PMML, an open standard for predictive model deployment, and also worked on ONNX, a newer open standard that is very popular now. She holds a PhD in Applied Mathematics and MS in Computer Science from University of Maryland, College Park.\nSvetlana enjoys learning new technologies and sharing her knowledge with others. She works on empowering girls and women in technology and is a proud mother of two daughters starting their technical careers.\n\n---\n\n\nCode BEAM V Europe\nWebsite: https://codesync.global/conferences/code-beam-sto-2021/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/CodeBEAMio"
