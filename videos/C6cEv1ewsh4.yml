description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM V 2020 - https://codesync.global/conferences/code-beam-v\n\nGet involved in the next Code Sync conference - https://codesync.global \n\n---\n\nTHE FUTURE OF PROGRAMMING\nby Francesco Cesarini and Veronica Lopez \n\n\nABSTRACT\nWhilst Erlang has been ahead of the curve for decades, other communities and technologies are quickly catching up, but not always in the most efficient way. In this talk, Francesco and Veronica share their experiences on the past, present and future of distributed software development in the Erlang Ecosystem. By looking at how systems which by nature were distributed and learning from past mistakes, they map out the evolution of where we are heading, and what we need to do to get there.\n\nSlides & full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/francesco-cesarini/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - FRANCESCO CESARINI\nCo-author of designing for scalability with Erlang/OTP\n\nFounder of Erlang Solutions Ltd. Francesco has used Erlang on a daily basis since 1995, starting as an intern at Ericsson’s computer science laboratory, the birthplace of Erlang. He moved on to Ericsson’s Erlang training and consulting arm working on the first release of OTP, applying it to turnkey solutions and flagship telecom applications. In 1999, soon after Erlang was released as open source, he founded Erlang Solutions, who have become the world leaders in Erlang based consulting, contracting, training and systems development.\nFrancesco has worked in major Erlang based projects both within and outside Ericsson, and as Technical Director, has led the development and consulting teams at Erlang Solutions.\nHe is the co-author of 'Erlang Programming' and 'Designing for Scalability with Erlang/OTP' both published by O'Reilly. Francesco is also a lecturer at the University of Oxford, and has participated in the Future Learn Erlang MOOC, O'Reilly and University of Kent online Master Classes and is a regular conference speaker and tutor.\n\nMore on Francesco Cesarini: https://codesync.global/speaker/francesco-cesarini/\n\nTHE SPEAKER - VERONICA LOPEZ\nSr. software engineer\n\nVeronica is a former physicist turned computer scientist, who currently finds joy building distributed systems with Go and Elixir, and trying to make physics and computers converge.\n\nMore on Veronica Lopez: https://codesync.global/speaker/veronica-lopez/\n\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM V 2020\nCode BEAM V is powered by Code Sync.
