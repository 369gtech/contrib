description: "Google Tech Talk\r\nJune 24, 2009\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nPhotoSketch: A Google SketchUp Plugin for Photo-Centric 3D Modeling\r\n\r\nPresented by Prof. George Wolberg\r\nDept. of Computer Science\r\nCity College of New York\r\n\r\nThis talk presents the PhotoSketch urban 3D modeling plugin for Google SketchUp.  PhotoSketch is designed to make it easy for SketchUp users to build phototextured 3D models of buildings directly from photographs.  We simplify the 3D modeling workflow by leveraging the SketchUp push-pull interface with computer vision and photogrammetry techniques.  The PhotoSketch plugin merges the benefits of automatic feature extraction, camera pose recovery, an intuitive sketching interface, and advanced texture mapping with occlusion detection to produce lightweight photorealistic 3D models of buildings.  These models typically consist of a few hundred polygons each, which makes them well-suited for use in high-performance visualization, online gaming, and web-based applications such as Google Earth.\r\n\r\nJoint work with Siavash Zokai, Brainstorm Technology LLC"
