You are a talented Java developer who have been using Apache Kafka in your projects On-Premises for very a long time, as well as writing code to write and read data to/from topics. However, recently your manager asked you to lead a project in which both Apache Kafka and other applications will run in the Cloud and just like that, you find yourself concerned about being able or not to deliver this project.\n\nThis talk will show that there is nothing to worry about, though you may put good use in a few tips and tricks provided by this talk to ensure the success of your project. Live demos will be used to show which changes your architecture and code should undergo, as well as discuss the kinds of problems that often arise in cloud deployments. This talk will also share which tools you must have in your arsenal, so you can do better use of your time and of the Cloud."
