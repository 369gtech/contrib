title: 'CSS Tutorial For Beginners 26 - The Universal Selector'
language: English
recordingDate: 1434725060
description: "Yo guys, in this CSS tutorial for beginners, we'll take a look at the universal selector, which is the mother of all selectors. The God particle of CSS. \n\nIt's pretty much like when physicists split the atom, all that weird sub-atomic junk came flying out. When you split open the universal selector you get ALL the HTML elements flying out of it at light speed. So yeah, it's pretty powerful. Use with caution.\n\nPut simple my black-belting karate friends with digi-nun-chucks, use the universal selector if you want to target EVERY element you have on your page. That's right, EEEEVERY element! \n\nAnyway, happy coding and peace out my bro's :)\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO CHANNEL - \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n========== CSS for Beginners Playlist ==========\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gQeDH6xYhmO-db2mhoTSrT\n========== HTML Basics Course ==========\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9ibZ2TSBaGGNrgh4ZgYE6Cc\n\n========== The Net Ninja ============\n\nFor more front-end development tutorials & to black-belt your coding skills, head over to - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg or http://thenetninja.co.uk\n\n========== Social Links ==========\n\nTwitter - @TheNetNinja - https://twitter.com/thenetninjauk"
