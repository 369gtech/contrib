recordingDate: 1542634585
description: "Meena Kothandaraman from twig+fish will review a case study that involved collaboration with the City of Boston Mayor’s Housing iLab. The Housing iLab was tasked with creating meaningful and sustainable housing and policy solutions to address an emerging problem in the city of Boston: a housing crisis for middle income residents. Thus far, the City gave predominant focus to all the numbers collected on housing preferences and realities. Hearing the personal stories of city dwellers brought to light a more human focus on the emotions, attitudes and preferences that play into housing choices. The study was applauded as an important step forward in the City’s approach, and has inspired the inclusion of human stories across other city challenges. Meena will detail the five-phased approach that provided structure and transparency to this study.\n- Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/amuse\n\nSave the date!
