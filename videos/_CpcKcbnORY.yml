description: "Slides and more info: http://www.codemesh.io/codemesh2015/elise-huard\n\nFunctional Reactive Programming is the functional version of reactive programming - which encodes the state in terms of reacting to external events.  It has a seductive simplicity in its principles, and is used for instance for native user interfaces.\n\nHow does it fare when used in games, where a lot happens all the time, and state can evolve to high levels of complexity?  This talk will discuss the pros and cons of working with FRP, based on the experience of writing a casual game in Haskell.\n\nTalk objectives:\n\n- give a small intro to what FRP is\n\n- show with examples how the FRP network grows with the number of elements in the game\n\n- how to work with ephemeral state parts\n\n- how to have several subnetworks for stages of the game (levels, etc)\n\n- how to improve performance by putting some of the subnetworks to sleep when they're out of view\n\nTarget audience:\n\n- Functional programmers, preferably with at least a beginner's knowledge of Haskell, who are interested in games or how far you can take the concept of FRP.\n\nAbout Elise\n\nElise is a software consultant who’s been crafting and bashing together software for about 15 years now. Her skill set comprises talking to people, Haskell, Clojure, R, javascript, ruby, C and a good few bits and bobs beside. She’s based in Berlin, Germany. She enjoys reading sci-fi, traveling, cooking, tinkering, and spending time with her husband and baby daughter."
