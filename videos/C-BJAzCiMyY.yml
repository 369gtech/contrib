description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nWhat You Need to Know About OpenMetrics - Brian Brazil, Robust Perception & Richard Hartmann, Grafana Labs \n\nThe OpenMetrics format intends to standardise metric exposition, making it easy for both those developing and operating systems to monitor them. While it is based on the Prometheus format, it is however a new format. Will it be supported by your monitoring system? Will you need to rewrite your existing instrumentation? What's needed to transition? What about 3rd party systems you don't control? How does this differ and expand, and improve on the existing Prometheus format? Do you have to use Prometheus?\n\nhttps://sched.co/ZevQ"
