description: "Having made its Java EE 6 Web Profile certification debut at JavaOne 2011 and having won a JavaOne Rock Star award in 2012, Apache TomEE combines the simplicity of Tomcat with the power of Java EE. This updated presentation traverses the world of TomEE and shows how Tomcat applications leveraging Java EE technologies can become simpler and lighter with a Java EEâ€“certified solution built right on Tomcat. The first part jumps right into action and gives a coding tour of TomEE, including quickly bootstrapping projects, doing proper testing with Arquillian, and setting up environments. The second part gives insight into how TomEE was created and explores the budding TomEE ecosystem of tools, platforms, and the latest community advancements.\n\n\nAuthor:\nDavid Blevins\nVeteran of Open Source Java EE in both implementing and defining JavaEE specifications for over 10 years with a strong drive to see JavaEE simple, testable and as light as Java SE.
