description: "Repeatable Deployments with Kubernetes, Helm & Bazel - Rohan Singh, Hustle Inc \n\nCan you run a single command to build your applications, generate the appropriate Kube manifests, and deploy everything to each of your clusters?    If you've tried to set this up, you know that you can quickly end up with a rat's nest of custom scripts and repetitive YAML blobs. Even tools like Helm don't completely solve the problem.    In this talk, we'll cover how to wrangle this complexity with Bazel, a multi-platform build tool from Google. With Bazel, we can build Docker images, generate Kube objects, and deploy to a live cluster in a single step.    We'll also see how to use Bazel to parameterize YAML files and deploy slightly different configurations to different environments, without having to repeat and duplicate entire manifests. Finally, we'll cover how Bazel can be extended to compile and deploy Helm charts as well. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPYs"
