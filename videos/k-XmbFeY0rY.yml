title: '[DevFest du Bout du Monde 2020] The Flutter Journey to a Production App'
language: French
recordingDate: 1593004189
description: "In this talk, I’ll explain the process of turning an idea into an app, building it, publishing and lessons learned along the way.\n\nThe app is 100% in Flutter and powered by Firebase. Thanks to the open source nature of the platform and external dependencies as well as features of the Dart programming language, the development of the app could be done very quickly. The app is currently in production and has 100+ daily active users.\n\nOther topics that will be covered include: - Material Design implementation on the Flutter framework - Resources (strings, styles) management - Properly managing crash reporting and handling the Flutter red screen of death - Localization - Creating flavors - Tips and common tasks done during development\n\nFinally, I’ll talk about the power of the community and how your users can help you build a better product.\n\nElaine Dias Batista"
