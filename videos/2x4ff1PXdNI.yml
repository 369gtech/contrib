title: 'YOW! 2017 Phil Calçado - The Next Generation of Microservices'
language: English
recordingDate: 1520754343
description: "How are microservices in 2017 different from how we used to build them at the beginning of the decade?\n\nMore traditional Service-Oriented Architectures were defined by protocols and standards published and curated by industry consortiums. Knowledge of the architectural style usually called \"microservices\", on the other hand, is often in the form of patterns, cautionary tales, and tools extracted from real-world reports and software made available by organisations that have adopted this style.\n\nAlmost ten years since the first wave of such reports, the landscape has changed considerably. Many hard challenges from the past have been eased or completely solved, and a lot of the custom software created by the microservices pioneers have been made off-the-shelf open source software.\n\nIn this talk, Phil Calçado will contrast what we first found in the first generation of microservices architectures against the current generation's landscape. Let's talk about which previous common knowledge and patterns are deprecated, which ones are still active, and introduce some of the ones that have been recently added to our toolbox.\n\nPhil Calçado is an engineer at Buoyant, working on Linkerd, the pioneering open-source service mesh software used by everyone from small startups to Fortune 100 companies. Before Buoyant, he was the Director of Engineering at DigitalOcean, leading the microservices adoption that now powers the cloud provider. Phil is known as a pioneer in microservices, as he headed the teams that built SoundCloud's microservices architecture and their product engineering organisation.\n\nFor more on YOW! conferences, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
