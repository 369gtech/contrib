description: "Color is one of the first things we learn how to do in CSS — and yet many of us don’t ever go further than typing hex numbers handed to us by a designer. But getting colors to appear on a screen is just the beginning. Discover the secrets behind hex color values, and how to use simple math to adjust color attributes like saturation and brightness. Find out why colors look different on different devices, and what you can do about it. Learn how to adjust colors with media queries to make sure your colors look their best on any screen size. Find out how user context may affect the appropriate colors for a website. And finally, learn how you can make this whole color thing a lot less complicated by using a CSS preprocessor like Sass to manage your color choices and create color variations automatically.\n\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/clarissapeterson/colorincss\nAbout Clarissa: http://www.clarissapeterson.com\n\nMore about CSS Day: http://cssday.nl or http://twitter.com/cssdayconf\nReceive conference announcements in your inbox: http://cssday.nl/subscribe"
