description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nDesign Patterns for Extendable, Scalable K8s Extensions - Max Smythe, Google & Rita Zhang, Microsoft \n\nOPA Gatekeeper is a customizable Kubernetes admission webhook that helps enforce policies and strengthen governance. The Gatekeeper project is capable of dynamically creating, managing and destroying new custom resources which are used to customize the webhook. This unique model has led to some interesting design patterns. In this talk, Gatekeeper's maintainters explore the CRDs-that-create-CRDs and leaderless horizontal scalability design patterns that allowed us to create an extendable, scalable Kubernetes extension. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ekBY"
