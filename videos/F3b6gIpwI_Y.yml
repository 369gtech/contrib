description: "Dualing Platforms: Building Services for Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes Using the Open Service Broker API - Alex Ley & Matt McNeeney, Pivotal\n\nIn a digital world, widely adopted and easy to use APIs are the cornerstone of collaboration and interoperability. The Open Service Broker API working group brings together experts from Google, RedHat, Pivotal, SAP and IBM in order to demolish barriers in the adoption of cloud-native services, with a user-centric approach focused on delivering features based exclusively in real world use cases.\n\nAfter providing an introduction to cloud-native applications and the need for stateful services, we will explain how the Open Service Broker API project can help developers build a variety of services that can be deployed once and consumed anywhere.\n\nWe will then run a live side-by-side demo where we build and deploy a service broker and then consume it from applications running in two different platforms: Cloud Foundry and Kubo (BOSH-powered Kubernetes).\n\nAbout Alex Ley\nTwitter Tweet  Websitehttps://twitter.com/alexevade\nAlex is a Product Manager for the Pivotal Cloud Foundry platform and is focused on enabling multi-cloud services using Cloud Foundry and BOSH.
