description: "Today’s CMS is ill-suited to meet tomorrow’s increased demands on contextuality and user experience. It tries to do everything at once, which is doomed to fail. Building solutions with such a system as a base is seldom as good as you intended. But there is a solution that can be applied to all CMS and provides many advantages in all areas.\n\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry in the Malmö/Lund region. Foo Café is aimed at those interested in sharing, learning and creating. \nJoin the fun at foocafe.org"
