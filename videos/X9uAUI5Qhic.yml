description: "Serverless platforms are suited to a wide range of applications from IoT & chatbots through to microservices and web hooks. In this session, I’ll introduce you to how serverless applications work and embrace cloud services to live in a world where there are many separate parts that make up the application. I’ll cover the architectural patterns we use to design a serverless application including handling their stateless nature, how to use multiple functions for a task and leveraging event processing to trigger further functions. I will then turning my attention to showing you how to put these into practice by looking at how they can be implemented in an Lambda or Apache OpenWhisk.\n\nPresentation: https://disk.yandex.ru/i/4mwF32aX6mzhvA\n\nPHPFest: https://2020.phpfest.ru/lecture/9"
