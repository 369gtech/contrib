description: "CF on a Budget: Controlling Cost with Your PaaS - David Dobmeier, Stark & Wayne\n\nBeing cost-conscious in a cloud world can be difficult. Especially on public clouds, where deployment footprint and instance sizing can be difficult to get right. Throw in lower environments, like sandbox, quality assurance, and development, and youâ€™ve got the makings of a big cloud services bill. In this talk, Dave will present multiple approaches and strategies to running Cloud Foundry on a budget, including resource-based instance sizing, co-locating Cloud Foundry components, and AWS spot instances.\n\nAbout David Dobmeier\nDavid Dobmeier is a Cloud Engineer at Stark & Wayne. He has seven years of experience including Systems/Network Administration to DevOps, Software Development, and Cloud Infrastructure. In the past few years, he has focused on large-scale infrastructure and software systems including deploying CloudFoundry, building and maintaining BOSH releases, and working on open source tools to streamline deployment and maintenance of such systems. He has also worked with both the PCF and Open Source communities on installation, training, and operating their new systems.\n\nhttps://www.cloudfoundry.org/"
