recordingDate: 1381523716
description: 'Common sense says that doing things in Aglie way (small iterations, re-testing all the time, not having functional departments) is way more expensive than doing things the traditional way. So why more and more companies choose Agile methods? How to calculate if it is more expensive or cheaper to use Agile? I will share few real projects and products examples and we will draw conclusions about Agile economics from them.'
