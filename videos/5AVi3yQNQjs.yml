description: "Titel: Why FaaS is the Least Important Part of Serverless\n\nThe serverless trend emerged from the introduction of FaaS from providers like AWS Lambda. Moving compute from instances and containers to on-demand FaaS has massive appeal. But functions are one small part of the serverless story! I'll present a way of building serverless applications to minimise code and maximise use of managed services. This approach shifts the emphasis from coding to the development of powerful, scalable architectures. I'll show five ways of replacing many of your Lambdas with alternative managed services and explain why code should first and foremost be a tool for building on-demand infrastructure.\n\nI will cover five common uses for serverless functions today; orchestration, delegation, data reshaping, database storage or querying and service integration.\n\nIn each case, I will demonstrate how system complexity, cost and maintenance effort can be reduced by adopting client-side orchestration, an event bus, managed data stores and cloud-native data transformation solutions (AWS Glue, S3 Select, Kinesis Data Firehose)\n\nSpeaker: Eóin Shanaghy - CTO at fourTheorem\n\nEoin is the CTO and co-founder of fourTheorem. He is an architect and developer with experience in building and scaling systems for dynamic startups and large enterprises. Eoin has been learning and building using many different technology eras from CORBA-based distributed systems in 2000 to full-stack container and serverless applications of late.\n\nEoin is the author of \"AI as a Service\", a book on serverless platforms with managed AI from Manning Publications, launching March 2019.\n\nHaving worked building products in a lot of fun and interesting sectors from banking and telecoms to video streaming and entertainment, Eoin co-founded fourTheorem to take that experience and use amazing new technologies to transform customers' businesses.\n\nWhen Eoin has had it with all the whiteboarding and keyboard mashing, he likes to go running, play piano and on some occasions, the trombone."
