description: "Celebrating the 10th anniversary of the agile manifesto in 2011 has been a fabulous achievement for a movement as much devoted to the welfare of technology workers as it is the delivery of real value to their employers and society in general. Today's agilists are at the cutting edge of a revolution in delivering value to society, but it seems they are standing on the shoulders of giants. This talk takes the long view back, reviewing a number of key lessons from the last 6 decades, from various case studies, a gratuitous number of which involve cool, high-tech space engineering and large scale teams that hung on a thread of agile and systems thinking in one way or another to succeed and innovate. Apart from lending some useful historical perspective, it also examines the extent to which a lean organisation is necessary to provide context to agile software developers, and how that impacts long term success. If your CEO doesn't get it, what hope do you have? And what happens to all the 'not very agile' tech-workers whose jobs are being heavily impacted by radical new* team structures?\n\nThe intelligent application of technology to business challenges has been the core of Nigel Dalton's 25 year career. He now plies his trade as a systems thinking technologist for the betterment of all Australian and NZ organisations working for Luna Tractor in Melbourne.\n\nJames brings more than a decade's experience in agile ways of working to Luna Tractor, although he spent a few of them not knowing that the incremental, innovative, customer-centric, team-focused, and common-sense approaches to building software and businesses had a fancy name at all. Luna Tractor is named after the Russian space program’s Lunokhod vehicles – a dramatic contrast to the American Apollo moon landing program where for a fraction of the cost, 2 robotic landers were sent in the early 1970s to analyse the surface and moon environment. By asking the question a different way ie “how can we learn about conditions on the moon” (rather than “how can we get a man on the moon?”) they saved money, time and lives - see the website http://www.lunatractor.com for a full explanation of what has been called 'Australia's silliest startup name'. James leads the scientific thinking within the company by constantly (and usually diplomatically, though sometimes not) challenging organisational status quos, being obsessed with learning, experimenting with and adapting Agile and Lean methodologies (plus more) to all aspects of business. Luna Tractor is now providing executive and team coaching around Lean and Agile ways of becoming remarkable (to quote Seth Godin), helping startups work more effectively, and reducing risk around getting new ideas to become real in the hands of customers. James is the co-author (with Nigel) of the upcoming ebook 'Not Just an IT Thing', the story of the application of systems thinking, lean and agile at Lonely Planet between 2007 and 2011.\n\nFor more on YOW!
