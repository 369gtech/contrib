description: "The demand for stream processing is increasing a lot these day. Immense amounts of data has to be processed fast from a rapidly growing set of disparate data sources. This pushes the limits of traditional data processing infrastructures. These stream-based applications include trading, social networks, Internet of things, system monitoring, and many other examples.\n\nA number of powerful, easy-to-use open source platforms have emerged to address this. But a same problem can be solved differently, various but sometimes overlapping use-cases can be targeted or different vocabularies for similar concepts can be used. This may lead to confusion, longer development time or costly wrong decisions.\n\nIn this talk we are going to discuss various state of the art open-source distributed streaming frameworks, their similarities and differences, implementation trade-offs and their intended use-cases. Apart of that, I’m going to speak about Fast Data, theory of streaming, framework evaluation and so on. My goal is to provide comprehensive overview about modern streaming frameworks and to help fellow developers with picking the best possible for their particular use-case.\n\nTalk by Petr Zapletal\nMarch 4th, 2016\n\nProduced by NewCircle - Training & Resources for Developers:\nhttps://newcircle.com/"
