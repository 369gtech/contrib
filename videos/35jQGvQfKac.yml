description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM V 2020 - https://codesync.global/conferences/code-beam-sto/\n\nA war story from failures to success | Timmo Verlaan\n\nABSTRACT\nDeveloping a communication platform seems to be the perfect fit for the BEAM. At least, that is what we thought when we set out to replace the existing Astrisk-based platform. Picking the proper tools is a good start, but when you develop in isolation for 2-3 years you might not learn about the BEAM characteristics under load. After 6 months in production, the first warning signs started to show.\nJoin our war story and learn what to avoid and how to change failures into success.\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS\nFailures\nLearnings\nWar story\n\nOBJECTIVES\nShare learnings with a wider audience.\nCreate openness and trust in sharing failures.\n\n• Follow us on social: \n  Website: https://codesync.global/conferences/code-beam-sto/\n  Twitter: https://twitter.com/CodeBEAMio\n\n• Looking for a unique learning experience?\n  Attend the next Code Sync conference near you! \n  See what's coming up at: https://codesync.global \n\n• SUBSCRIBE TO OUR CHANNEL\n  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC47eUBNO8KBH_V8AfowOWOw"
