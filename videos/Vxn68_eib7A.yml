description: "How much do you know about in-memory data caching in C#? In this challenge, you will need to identify how to cache three different simulated database calls. Two of those calls will include parameters just to make things a bit trickier. \n\nIf you get stuck, you can always subscribe and watch me solve this challenge and every previous challenge.\n\nRemember, even pro athletes practice so why should you do any less?\n\nChallenge Page (with solution): https://www.iamtimcorey.com/courses/c-weekly-challenges/lectures/10012332\nSubscribe to Solutions: https://www.iamtimcorey.com/p/c-weekly-challenges"
