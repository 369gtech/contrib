description: "What even makes sense in Javascript? For a language originally created in 10 days it surely has a lot of quirks and perks many JS developers are unaware of. Sometimes, it might even seem like we fell down the rabbit hole only to find that NaN is actually a Number, undefined can be defined, +!![] equals 1, Array.sort() may not work as you suspected and so much other nonsense that can trip any JS developer’s mind.\n\nThis talk is a collection of Javascript’s oddities and unexpected behaviors that hopefully will prevent some future headaches and help understand the language that we all love in a more deeper and meaningful way."
