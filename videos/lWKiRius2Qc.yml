description: "It started as an off-­hours hobby, but when Biying and Matt (Co-Founders of Hot Pop Factory) began 3D printing and distributing a retail product right out of their home, their understanding of traditional manufacturing processes was completely altered. One year, several TV interviews, and a few art installations later, they had both quit architecture jobs to start their own design and fabrication workshop.\n\nCome check out thir talk and learn everything you didn’t want to know about computational design and digital manufacturing processes like 3D printing, laser cutting, and CNC machining. These are the tools that will revolutionize the way physical products will be designed and made over the next 10 years.\n\nBiying Miao\nCo-Founder, Hot Pop Factory\nhttps://twitter.com/hotpopfactory\nhttps://twitter.com/biyingmeow\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/pub/biying-miao/23/b57/3b1\nhttp://instagram.com/hotpopfactory\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
