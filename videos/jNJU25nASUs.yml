title: 'JDK IO 2017 - Jan Ypma - Reactive data marshalling ...  made fun again'
recordingDate: 1510512576
description: 'In traditional information systems, XML and JSON marshalling is considered a solved problem. You pick a framework of choice, slap some annotations onto your classes, and get going. But most frameworks have 2 big disadvantages: they require the full object graph to be in memory, and by using annotations, you can''t use your IDE to help you customize marshalling. In this presentation, a new approach to both reading and writing XML, JSON and CSV will be presented, which leverages lambdas and reactive streams to allow bounded, streaming processing of that data.'
