description: "Mattias Karlsson\nFinal words and thank you for Jfokus 2019\n\nMark Reinhold\nModern Java: Change is the Only Constant\nIn the past year, we changed Java in three ways that we never have before: We modularized the platform, we removed some components, and we accelerated the pace of new releases. These changes aim to keep Java vibrant in an ever-changing world of competing platforms and new styles of application deployment, whether to the cloud or to app stores. They are disruptive, but they?re not as scary as you may think, and many developers have already adjusted to them.\n\nBrian Goetz\nFP vs OO: Choose Two\nThis talk is about the fictitious divisions we invent, and how they harm the progress of our industry. In particular, we'll look at the supposed tension between Functional Programming and Object-Oriented Programming, and hopefully see that the tension is all in our heads."
