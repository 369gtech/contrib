description: "Should you study at university? What are the benefits and the drawbacks?\n\nThis is an old interview from 2016 that I never got around to editing, where my friend Jakob and I talk about the pros and cons of studying at university for programmers. We studied Information Systems.\n\nI realize that the footage is way too shaky so I'll try to avoid \"walking interviews\" in the future ðŸ™‚  Apologies."
