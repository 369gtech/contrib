title: 'Codemotion Berlin 2019 I To pair or not to pair? -Birgitta Boeckeler, ThoughtWorks'

description: "Pair programming is an agile development practice that is generally well-known of, but still has only patchy adoption. This talk is about why that might be, and what challenges I have seen that hold people back from reaping the benefits. I’ll also talk about the benefits that go beyond “knowledge sharing” and “learning”, benefits I realised over the course of many years working on teams who systematically pair. For those in the audience who are not convinced that it’s useful, or who only use it irregularly, this will hopefully give them fresh inspiration to try it, or try it again.\n\nAbout:\nBirgitta Boeckeler, Principal Developer - ThoughtWorks\n\nI am a software developer and consultant with ThoughtWorks in Germany. I have been building software across all layers for almost 15 years now, mainly in the space of large custom-developed websites. Since I first discovered how to talk to computers, I have not been able to stop. I thrive on juggling the complexities of building software and finding the simplicity in it, and I love that it never gets old."
