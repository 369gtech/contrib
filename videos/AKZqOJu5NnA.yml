language: English
recordingDate: 1632327470
description: "Figuring out how to architect a new application is a big deal. A tremendous amount of time and resources can be lost due to poorly written code. This happens when over-worked developers—feeling pressure from their managers or from the client to get the job done quickly—rush to get to prod, sometimes at the expense of quality code. \n \n Doing it the wrong way can lead to a huge headache later. In this presentation, we're going to look at: \n \n - What is clean code?\n - Characteristics of clean code\n - How to start clean coding\n - Importance of clean code\n\nChiamaka Okenwa, Software Engineer at Renmoney\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/the-art-of-clean-code-250224676"
