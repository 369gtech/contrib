description: "Speaker: Desmond Koh\r\n\r\nFor the first time, Apple is giving developers the ability to create their own machine learning models through Create ML with Xcode’s Playgrounds! All we need is some data and we’re ready to go!\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, Desmond will be sharing some of the basic features of Create ML to build a local food image recognition prototype with Create ML and Core ML, where you can run machine learning models on your device and the data doesn’t need to leave the device to be analysed! (Create ML is still in beta at the time of writing)\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/Singapore-iOS-Dev-Scout-Meetup/events/253639151/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\r\nRecorded by: Yeo Kheng Meng\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/lARS/"
