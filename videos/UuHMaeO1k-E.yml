description: "Social Code\nhttp://www.codemesh.io/codemesh2014/garrett-smith\nHave you ever read someone's code and exclaimed, \"What in tarnation? What is going on here? What was this person on? I hate my job!\" Be honest, was that other person ever you, maybe once?\n\nCode is no longer merely a technical problem - it's also social. We write code for others. We write code for ourselves. We use computer languages to express our ideas and our intentions. What we leave behind is a social artifact that either respectful, or, as is often the case, careless and sometimes outright rude. In this talk Garrett will outline a standard for writing social code -\n\nthat is, code that is that is readable, maintainable and that obviously reflects the intent of its author. He'll use a simple refactoring exercise to translate production code (in Erlang no less)\nfrom unintelligible-and-confusing to clear-and-respectful to future readers.\n\nIf you're concerned with code quality, the cost of software, and the speed of shipping new functionality to users, this talk will provide specific points to improve your organization's programming craft."
