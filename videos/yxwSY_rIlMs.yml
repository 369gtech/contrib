title: 'Data vault modeling in a complex data environment - Hendrik Ruijter & Anders Lindström'
recordingDate: 1556200043
description: "We want to share our experiences in implementing a cloud-based Data Warehouse data vault model. Our company’s operational systems collect telemetry data, real time events and surveillance data from millions of devices. We have all the corporate systems related to logistics, finance and other data storage solutions used in different parts of the organization. A data vault model is meant to be robust towards changes in source systems, data should be loaded in parallel, and additions to the model should be easy to integrate. Here be dragons.\n\nHendrik Ruijter has 20+ years’ experience from e.g. Axis, SonyEricsson and Sony in different roles. He works with cloud data warehouse development in Verisure Innovation. He is interested in data vault modeling as a bridge between operational 3NF models and dimensional report models. Software-as-a-service data warehouses like Snowflake is another interest.\n\nAnders Lindström has 10+ years’ experience as a consultant within Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence.  He works at Combitech helping customers like Verisure to realize their dream of a common data platform built for analytics. For the latest years, he has been working primarily with Data Vault modeling in order to solve integration issues in a business-friendly way. Data Warehouse automation is another interest.\n_____________________\nFoo Café is a meeting place for people with an interest in software development and IT. \nHere, user groups and partner companies find the perfect atmosphere for sharing knowledge and develop competence. \nFoo Café is open for everyone and is free to attend.
