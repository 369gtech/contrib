language: English
recordingDate: 1632243909
description: "Start with an analogy. Then delve into CUDA with some pytorch code to demonstrate why we use GPUs instead of just CPUs.\n\nUnderstand both the hardware and software aspect to how GPUs speed up training. Deep Dive into Block Multiplication, CUDA.\n\nCREDITS:\nVideo was created by CodeEmporium, a channel dedicated to all things Data Science, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence.
