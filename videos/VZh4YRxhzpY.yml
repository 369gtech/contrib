title: 'Math for Game Developers - Maximum Projectile Altitude (Derivatives/Maximum)'
recordingDate: 1413486006
description: "By taking a derivative and setting it to zero we can find the time of the maximum height of a projectile. This is because when the derivative is zero is the exact moment that the projectile's velocity switches from being positive to being negative.\n\nFind the source code here: https://github.com/BSVino/MathForGameDevelopers/tree/calculus-derivative\n\nNew video every Thursday.
