title: 'From Fix to Final Release: Continuous Integration and Testing for Diego - Jen Spinney & Andrew Edgar'
language: English
recordingDate: 1475944651
description: "When the Diego team publishes a new release of Diego, it needs to be solid. When operators know they can trust the latest releases, they are more likely to update regularly and stay current with the latest features and security patches. \n\nThus, the Diego team works hard to ensure the quality of each release they publish. At the same time, the steps involved in creating a final release must be quick and easy. A critical aspect of agile software development is being able to turn out new features and security fixes rapidly. \n\nIn this talk, Jen and Andrew from Diego discuss the battery of tests Diego code is run through along with the design of the teamâ€™s continuous integration pipeline. They will discuss the testing strategies and tools used at different verification scopes (unit, component, cross-component, etc.) and spend some extra time discussing the test suites specific to Diego, such as the upgradability suite and the BBS benchmarking suite. Attendees will learn how they can apply these techniques to their own projects and feel more confident in the software they release.\n\nAndrew Edgar\nIBM Canada\nSenior Software Developer\nCanada\nAndrew has over 24 years of experience in the Software Development industry.
