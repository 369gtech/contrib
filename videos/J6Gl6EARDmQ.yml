title: 'Idit Levine - How to use serverless and microservices together'
recordingDate: 1557971240
description: "Idit Levine is the founder and CEO of solo.io, a Boston-based company that develops tools to help the enterprise adopt and make the most of innovative cloud technologies. Idit is an enthusiastic active member of the open-source community. Among the open-source projects coming from solo are Gloo, the function gateway, which melds monolithic, microservices, and serverless apps; Squash, a platform for debugging microservices applications; and UniK, an orchestration tool for microVMs and unikernels. Recently Idit shared with the community her vision of the multi-mesh, an architecture pattern in which users will use multiple and different service meshes on the multi-cloud. To make this vision a reality, Solo announced SuperGloo, an open-source service mesh orchestration platform.\r\n - Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/channel/craftconf with the Ustream Mobile App"
