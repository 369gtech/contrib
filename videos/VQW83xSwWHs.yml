title: 'The Build That Cried Broken: Building Trust in Your Continuous Integration Tests'
language: English
recordingDate: 1632327470
description: "\"Continuous integration (CI) is an excellent source of fast feedback for teams. When development check-ins are made, the automated tests are able to verify that the system is still working as expected. However, for many teams, one or more of their tests ultimately fail, causing the entire build to break. If this happens frequently enough, the team begins to lose faith in the tests and no longer regards the red build as an indicator that something is broken (other than the tests themselves). \n \n In this talk, youâ€™ll learn how to build stability within your automated tests; tips for managing continuous integration tests that are failing with just cause; and how to influence the perception of the credibility of the tests among team members.\"\n\nAngie Jones, Senior Director, Developer Relations at Applitools"
