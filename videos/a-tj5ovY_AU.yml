description: "Wide Event Analytics\n\nIgor Wiedler\n\nSoftware is becoming increasingly complex and difficult to debug in production. Yet most of the monitoring systems of today are not equipped to handle high cardinality data needed to effectively operate large-scale services. It doesn't have to be this way! If we treat monitoring as an analytics problem, we can gain the ability to query our events with a lot more flexibility, get answers to questions previously unthinkable, and do so at interactive query latencies.\n\nhttps://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa19/conference-program"
