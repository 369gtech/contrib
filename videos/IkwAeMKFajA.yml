It then elaborates on different careers in the field of Data Science - the roles and responsibilities, skills and salaries associated with each of those careers. It also takes you on a roadmap of skills you should acquire sequentially to become a Data Science Wizard (i.e. Data Scientist). It then draws a contrast between how most professionals enter into Data Science Field ( i.e. Short-term entry-level job in data science, Medium-term mid-level data science job and finally Long-term Top level Data Science job) as opposed to what is a smart way of cutting right to Top-level job. The video exits with some incredibly useful resources to achieve the latter. \n\nFollowing pointers are covered in this How to Become an AI Engineer:\n1) Why Data Science?\n2) What are different careers in Data Science?\n3) Skills roadmap\n4) Career Path - Short, Medium & Long Term\n5) Certifications & Resources\n\n------------------------------------\n\nCheck out Edureka's Data Science Blog & Tutorial Series to learn more concepts of Data Science:\n\nâœ…Blog Series:  http://bit.ly/data-science-blogs\nâœ…Data Science Tutorial Playlist: http://bit.ly/3tdteya\n\nðŸ”´Subscribe to our channel to get video updates.
