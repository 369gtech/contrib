recordingDate: 1574286019
description: "Abstract: The reactive revolution continues. For as much as we've been talking about reactive programming in Spring for the last few years the journey has only just begun. Join Josh Long, and we'll take our reactive applications further, looking at how to build microservices for cloud platforms like PAS (Cloud Foundry) and PKS (Kubernetes). Some of the things we may cover include: - reactive NoSQL data access - reactive SQL data access with R2DBC - orchestration and reliability patterns like client-side load balancing, circuit breakers, and hedging - messaging and service integration with Apache Kafka or RSocket - API gateways with Spring Cloud Gateway and patterns like rate limiting - API adapters - serverless programming with Spring Cloud Function and project Riff - reactive authentication and authorisation with Spring Security.\n\nSpeaker: Josh Long, Spring Developer Advocate, Pivotal\n\nFilmed at Pivotal Summit 2019 Singapore"
