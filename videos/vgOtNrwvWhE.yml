description: "Have you ever found yourself lost in a server room, or more often a closet, no idea where to start and confused if you are ever going to find the right port? Have you logged into the gateway router, when you're pretty sure you were supposed to be on a switch, and all of the sudden everything stops working, but you are 99% confident you didn't actually do anything? Then this talk is for you! We will discuss the foundations of network architecture. We'll cover what people mean when they say flat network, and why that's harder to diagnose when there are issues. We will walk through two example networks, home and SME, talking about how you can embed security and privacy by design.\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
