title: 'Christopher Jack - Using Perl to parse terabytes of mission critical variable'

description: "3 security doors, a PC with no external access, and terabytes of semi-structured data needing parsing with big money riding on it. Would Perl be up for the challenge?\n\nThe twist will be revealed in the talk (it’s a doozy).\n\nA large number of financial documents needed parsing. Accuracy was mission critical and money was literally riding on it. There was no specification and the meaning of some data was not even known to our client contacts. Many many years of data. The format shifted over time. It’s in a binary print format I had never heard of.\n\nWould a very loose Backus-Naur Form approach work? Discuss."
