title: '"Build your own Open Hardware CPU in 25 minutes or less" - Anton Blanchard (LCA 2020)'
recordingDate: 1578987261
description: "Anton Blanchard\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/152/\n\nOpen hardware architectures and cheap FPGAs have allowed software people (like myself) to get involved in hacking CPUs. This talk will take you through the steps of downloading, simulating and synthesising Microwatt, an OpenPOWER core onto an FPGA. It will show just how easy it is to get both Micropython and Zephyr running, and how easy it is to make modifications to the core, such as adding new instructions.\r\n\r\nDuring the breaks we will be happy to help anyone get up and running, so if you have a Xilinx Artix 7 or Lattice ECP5 based board, bring it along!\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n#linux.conf.au #linux #foss #opensource\n\nMon Jan 13 13:50:00 2020 at Room 7"
