description: "If you've been in the mobile field for a while, you're sick of context debates. Sure, they all start innocently, but soon enough they collapse into a sad tangle of metaphysics (\"But what IS context anyway?\"), lazy stereotypes, and implausible scenarios involving public transport. So let's try a fresh approach. Dictionary definitions and \"it depends\" generalizations are hereby banned. Let's talk details. We'll discuss whether context even matters in modern web design, ways to find out how people will use your product, design principles for different situations, and why we've been looking at the whole thing upside-down anyway.\n\nAbout Cennydd: https://www.cennydd.com\nAbout Mobilism: https://mobilism.nl\n\nVideography generously sponsored by Mirabeau: https://www.mirabeau.nl"
