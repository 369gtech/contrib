description: "Through the concept of zero-cost abstractions, C++ has shown that it is possible to combine low-level control with high-level programming concepts. Rust is language that aims to offer the same sorts of zero-cost abstractions that C++ is capable of, while also enforcing memory safety and data-race freedom. The secret sauce is Rust's core notion of \"ownership\", which enables: \n\n- Memory safety without garbage collection; \n- Concurrency without data races, \n- Abstraction without overhead. \n\nIn this talk, I'll explain ownership and show how Rust uses it to guarantee thread safety, amongst other things. I'll also talk about how Rust is designed to scale to large code-bases, sharing some of our experiences here at Mozilla from integrating Rust code into Firefox. \n\nOne final theme of the talk is that the benefits of ownership go beyond having fewer bugs: once you are freed from the need to prevent memory-safety violations, it becomes possible to write -- and **maintain** -- programs that aggressively pursue parallelization and other kinds of optimizations that would have been too risky or too difficult before.\n\nEVENT: C++Now 2017\n\nSPEAKER: Niko Matsakis\n\nPERMISSIONS: The original video was published on BoostCon YouTube channel with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nORIGINAL SOURCE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO1z-7cuRYI"
