description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going? Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe in Barcelona, May 20–23 (https://bit.ly/2B2vhMl), in Shanghai, June 24–26 (https://bit.ly/2JZcBjs), or in San Diego November 18–21 (https://bit.ly/2K031wW) in 2019.\n\nKubernetes CICD Hacks with MicroK8s and Kubeflow - Land Lu & Zhang Lei Mao, Canonical\n\nKubernetes is a great platform for running and managing complex distributed systems. Leveraging continuous integration (CI), and making continuous integration easy for your community to consume, can enhance the quality of your awesome solution and reduce the friction for your developers and users.  This talk will show how to greatly simplify the process of adding CI to your project, and adding it as a native solution rather than an afterthought. You’ll take advantage of the following technologies to easily and repeatedly setup a local CI apparatus for your kubernetes based solution that can also scale to a company wide solution:  - microk8s (microk8s.io) - a simple, one line install of pure upstream kubernetes - multipass - an open source and easy way to launch virtual appliances - CI and CD tools - eg jenkins, spinnaker.  We'll build and deploy Kubeflow (Machine Learning on Kubernetes)\n\nTo learn more click here: https://sched.co/FuJc"
