description: "Domain-Driven Design Europe 2020\nhttp://dddeurope.com - https://twitter.com/ddd_eu\n\nTurns out Domain-Driven Design works not only for cargo shipping. In this session I’d like to share the story of Plexop. Plexop is a large-scale marketing system that spans over a dozen of different business domains - from management of advertising spaces to sales agents’ commissions. To implement Plexop we had very limited resources and a very short time to market. That’s why we embraced Domain-Driven Design from day one, and boy did it pay out. I will show how DDD allowed us to manage complexities, and the things that we have learned the hard way - by making our own mistakes.\n\nI’m a software developer with nearly 20 years of industry experience. During the years I worked for companies large and small, in roles ranging from Software Engineer to Chief Architect. \n\nWhen away from work, I maintain an active media career as public speaker and blogger. I’m speaking and writing on topics such as Microservices, Domain-Driven Design, and more. Alongside the media work, I have a keen professional interest in Distributed Systems, Software Architecture, and Software Design in general.\n\nIn the remaining time, I read lots of books on various topics, fly R/C aircrafts, and rescue troubled animals."
