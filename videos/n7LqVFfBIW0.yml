description: "HighLoad++ 2015, 3 ноября\n\nПрезентация и тезисы:\nhttp://www.highload.ru/2015/abstracts/1916.html\n\nОригинал видео на англ.языке: https://youtu.be/NWtxp6_H07s\n\nNVDIMMs provide applications the ability to access in-memory data that will survive reboots. This is a huge paradigm shift happening in the industry. Intel has announced new instructions to support persistence. In this presentation, we educate developers on how to take advantage of this new kind of persistent memory tier. Using simple practical examples [3] [4], we discuss how to identify which data structures that are suited for this new memory tier, and which data structures are not. We provide developers a systematic methodology to identify how their applications can be architected to take advantage of persistence in the memory tier. Furthermore, we will provide basic programming examples for persistent memory and present common pitfalls."
