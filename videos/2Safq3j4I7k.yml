description: "In 2017 the REA Group inked a deal with the National Australia Bank to partner on providing home loans to the millions of Australians who spend time on realestate.com.au looking for property and lifestyle information.\n\nFrom Day 1 it was recognised that Australian business history is littered with the carcasses of failed mergers between our biggest institutions and organisations that represent the new digital economy, and that this REA-NAB partnership would require something special from an engineering, culture and governance perspective.\n\nIt only took 8 months for the moment of truth to arrive - an engineering riddle , wrapped in a cultural mystery, inside a governance enigma. The team that came together had to find a new path, a third way of solving the technical roadblocks that had arisen through complex system architectures and data integration necessary to satisfy our customer's needs.\n\nSix key lessons were drawn from the August 2017 moment of truth for the two engineering organisations, that should provide inspiration to others planning partnerships of this scale in future.\n\n\nAlexandre is a a motorcycle rider, full-time Head of Delivery at MYOB and part-time in the joint destruction and suffocation business (Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu).\n\nHe has been with MYOBâ€™s Engineering group for the past 4.5 years and have previously worked for Sensis, Primus Telecom, Sydney University and the UN Development Programme (UNDP) in similar Delivery Leadership roles. He is passionate about Agile, building high performing teams, transforming cultures and have a distinctive motivation for leading and developing people.\n\nFor more on YOW! conferences, visit http://www.yowconference.com.a"
