description: "Further information: https://berlinbuzzwords.de/17/session/building-vibrant-search-ecosystem-bloomberg\n\nSearch is a core technology that allows Bloomberg to deliver financial news and information quickly and reliably to our clients. The Search Infrastructure team has created a high performance, stable and scalable search ecosystem to support a large, complex and diverse set of search applications.\n\nProviding search as a service to the thousands of developers in this demanding environment requires us to take a holistic approach. In this talk I'll discuss both the organizational and technical challenges we've encountered and the approach we've taken to solve them. I'll dive into the details of our platform from the way we engage with our tenants, interact with the Solr community, to the infrastructure and tools we use to manage, monitor and scale our platform.\n\nThis talk is presented by Bloomberg.\n\nSpeaker:\nKen LaPorte"
