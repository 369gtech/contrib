description: "Security is perhaps the field in IT most shrouded in mystery yet the one which recieves the most media attention. Videos with masked hackers using\ncomputer generated voices threatening to destroy websites unless certain actions are taken are common place and it's hard to seperate fact from fiction. In the media the hacker is always the masked genius, exploiting some clever trick, doing millions in damage with the stroke of key. In tonights talk we will cover some of the myths of security, what is, and isn't possible and how to tell the difference. We will talk through the fabled denial of service attack and attempt to shine light on how it's used and what can be done to stop it, if anything. \n"
