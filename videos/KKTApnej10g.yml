description: "JFuture 2019, Minsk – November 16, 2019\n\nThe State of Reactive Streams, Oleh Dokuka\n\nThe past, the state, and the future of reactive streams. Learn how it was, it is in all programming languages and whether it survives in the future in JVM with upcoming Project Loom and its fibers.\n\nThe Reactive Streams specification is state of the art for asynchronous, non-blocking data streams with the fine-grained flow control. It brought a breath of fresh air to reactive programming in the Java ecosystem. As a result, we saw the gathering of many reactive libraries and APIs by one specification.\n\nClearly, that was done for a good future… but, does it have any future nowadays? How other programming ecosystems reacted to the appearance of the reactive-streams standard and did they adopted that standard or not? Moreover, will it survive after the introduction of fibers in JVM?\n\nAll these questions will be answered during the presentation, so we will clearly understand what the future waits for Reactive Streams."
