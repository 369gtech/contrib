The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nMake Deployments Easy with Project Nebula - Kenaz Kwa, PuppetSDCC\n\nDeploying a serverless application requires a wide variety of carefully orchestrated tasks. To get a single change out the door, you need to consider infrastructure provisioning, deployment strategies (Blue/Green, Canary, etc.), secrets management and auditing, logging and monitoring configuration, change management processes and more.\n\nProject Nebula is a new approach to continuously deploying cloud-native applications and infrastructure by composing the tools and workflows your developers already use into simple, repeatable deployment workflows. In this quick overview, weâ€™ll demonstrate how Project Nebula can standardize serverless deployments across your organization, and how it integrates with other tools in the cloud-native ecosystem."
