description: "No problem should have to be solved twice. In the battle for code reuse, libraries are your secret weapon. But how do you build a JavaScript library? What patterns should you use to organize library code that grows over time?\n\nIn this talk from HTML5DevConf, YouTube's Jeremy Kahn will focus on patterns that were developed in practice while writing actual open source JavaScript libraries. Kahn will go over testing, documentation, deployment optimization, and more.\n\n** We've got a lot more videos from HTML5DevConf! Check them out: http://ow.ly/fk5gq"
