description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nCloud Native Application Bundles, cnab.io, is an open-source package format specification for managing distributed applications with a single installable file. With bundles you can reliably provision application resources in different environments, and manage their application lifecycle, without having to use multiple toolsets.\n\nThe Cloud Native Application Specification, CNAB 1.0, was just released. A collaborative effort between Microsoft, Docker, Pivotal, and others.\n\nCarolyn Van Slyck, the co-creator of Porter, the friendly cloud installer that gives you building blocks to create CNAB bundles from your existing pipeline, will demonstrate real world bundles, answering common questions:\n\nWhat is a bundle?\nWhen are bundles useful?\nDoes this replace existing technology?\nWhy wouldnâ€™t I just use helm, terraform, etc?\nAre all CNAB tools the same? Interchangeable?"
