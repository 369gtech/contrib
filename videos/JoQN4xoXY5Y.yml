description: 'The combination of tools you should use to quickly solve a heap memory leak are: GC logging; a GC log viewer; a histogram dumper; a histogram comparer; a heap dump technique; a heap dump analyzer; an object generation count profiler. In this talk Iâ€™ll show examples of all these tools in action against a heap memory leak to identify, solve and fix it. The tools and techniques are applicable to the majority of heap leaks.'
