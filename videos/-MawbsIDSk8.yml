There exists no dearth of knowledge on writing operators or working with CRDs. There does exist however a simpler use case where one wants to add a small feature to an existing object like a service or deployment. In this talk, John Sundharam and Harsh Singh will guide you over how controllers work and how to write a simple and minimal controller using controller-runtime. They'll also show you how these controllers can be used to add functionality to existing kubernetes objects. \n\nhttps://sched.co/YWIt"
