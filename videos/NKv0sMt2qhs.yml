language: English
recordingDate: 1632834982
description: "Europe’s Official Laravel Conference \nhttps://laracon.eu\n\nFlorian Engelhardt wants to prepare you to be a PHP core contributor. You don’t need to create an RFC, write and maintain PHP extensions, or even write C code. He’ll show you how to contribute and to give back to the community by writing tests for the PHP core without writing a single line of C. Become empowered with a more intimate understanding of the most used server-side web programming language."
