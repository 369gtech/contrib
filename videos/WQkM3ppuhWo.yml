title: 'Matthew Gordon - Fighting Climate Change with Python - PyCon 2019'
recordingDate: 1557111000
description: "\"Speaker: Matthew Gordon\n\nMethane, the primary component of natural gas, is a 60 times more powerful climate change agent than carbon dioxide.  Current technologies for finding methane leaks in oil and gas infrastructure rely on driving well to well with a handheld camera.  At Kairos Aerospace, we have developed a plane-mounted sensor for detecting methane leaks, but the sensor is only part of the solution: getting information off the sensor and into customers’ hands required us to build an entire plane-to-report pipeline.  I’ll discuss the challenges we faced in developing a scalable, reliable, and cost-effective scientific computing platform in Python, with examples of novel solutions using Python’s extensive ecosystem of GIS, cloud computing and machine learning tools.\n\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2019 and https://github.com/PyCon/2019-slides\""
