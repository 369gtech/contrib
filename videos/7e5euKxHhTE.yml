title: 'Bootiful CQRS and Event Sourcing with Axon Framework'
language: English
recordingDate: 1538670922
description: "Events are becoming increasingly important in modern architectures. Although CQRS and Event Sourcing are increasingly being adopted, the complexity of implementing it is often highly over-estimated. In this session, we will see how Spring Boot's autoconfiguration and Axon's separation of business logic and infrastructure concerns allow you to set up a CQRS and Event Sourcing application in mere minutes. Then, we will scale is out by simply changing some configuration.\n\nSpeaker:\nAllard Buijze\nFounder and CTO, AxonIQ"
