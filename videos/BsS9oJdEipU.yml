recordingDate: 1433784667
description: "As internet usage grows rapidly, the performance and scalability demands of our applications keep increasing at a faster rate. Multicore systems are relatively inexpensive and quite readily available, so our applications need to exploit hardware parallelism to realize exponential performance gains. Developers should give more thought to concurrency than they ever did, to efficiently utilize the available hardware resources. This is critical for scaling the next generation of our applications and realizing the best-possible performance. This presentation discusses various ways to utilize the full potential of multicore systems and provides an introduction to the fork-join framework and constructs, plus lambdas that facilitate finer-grained parallelism.\n\n\nAuthors:\nSunil MUNDLURI\nSunil Mundluri have around 12 years of industry experience.
