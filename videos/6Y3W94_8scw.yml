description: "WebAssembly (aka wasm) is shipping in all modern browsers, but since it's (intentionally) very low level, it can be difficult to understand how it will be critical to future web applications--and definitely not just games and C++!\n\nIn this talk, Jay will demystify stack assembly languages like WebAssembly, even if you have zero experience with assembly and linear memory.\n\nEVENT: Jazoon Tech Days 2017\n\nSPEAKER: Jay Phelps\n\nPERMISSIONS: Coding Tech received permissions to republish this video from Conference Organizer.\n\nORIGINAL SOURCE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRwUD5SxF4o&t=769s"
