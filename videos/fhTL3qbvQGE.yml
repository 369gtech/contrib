title: 'YOW! Singapore 2019 - Eyung Lim - When citizen experience meets OpsTech in Service Journey'
recordingDate: 1572058880
description: 'Digital services for citizens are traditionally run in a fragmented and monolithic form. The presentation discusses approaches and means to streamline the services such that the individual touchpoint or system are “journey-aware”. There are several design considerations and implementation challenges e.g. product persona, design consistency and usability. The presentation will quote examples from Singapore Government Smart Nation initiative “Moments of Life” to reinforce the discussion. The speaker will continue to discuss the corresponding tech considerations and implementations when developing such digital service journey at the national level.'
