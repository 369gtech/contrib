description: "Space, the final frontier \nby Dom Davis (@idomdavis)\n\nSo we can send a spaceship 4.6 billion kilometres to rendezvous with something that's only a few kilometres big, but we still can't strip spaces from telephone numbers. In a world where computers can beat humans at Go there are still some fundamentals we can't seem to get right. In this talk we're going to look at a few of these and ask \"why are they so hard?\"\n\nDom Davis\n\nDom Davis is a veteran of The City and a casualty of The Financial Crisis. Not content with bringing the world to its knees he then went off to help break the internet before winding up in Norfolk where he messes about doing development and devops. Dom has been writing code since his childhood, sometime in the last millennium â€“ he hopes some day to become good at it.\n\nhttp://www.meetup.com/Norfolk-Developers-NorDev/events/230069172/"
