title: 'Tone Analysis - Fresh Machine Learning #3'
recordingDate: 1468808649
description: "This episode of Fresh Machine Learning is all Tone Analysis. Tone analysis consists of not just analyzing sentiment (positive or negative), but also analyzing emotions as well as writing style. There are a lot of dimensions to tone, and in this episode I talk about what I consider to be 3 seminal papers in this field. At the end of the episode, we use IBMâ€™s Watson Tone Analyzer API to build our own tone analysis web app.\n\nThe demo code for this video can be found here:\n\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/Tone-Analyzer\n\nI created a Slack channel for us, sign up here:\nhttps://wizards.herokuapp.com/\n\nI introduce three papers in this video\n\nConvolutional neural networks for sentence classification:\n\nhttp://emnlp2014.org/papers/pdf/EMNLP2014181.pdf\n\nText categorization using LSTM for region embeddings:\n\nhttp://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.02373v2.pdf\n\nHierarchical attention networks for document classification:\n\nhttps://www.cs.cmu.edu/~diyiy/docs/naacl16.pdf\n\nMore info about the IBM Watson Tone Analyzer API:\n\nhttp://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/tone-analyzer.html\n\nSome great notes, slides, and practice problems for NLP:\n\nhttp://cs224d.stanford.edu/syllabus.html\n\nLive demo of the Watson Tone Analyzer:\n\nhttps://tone-analyzer-demo.mybluemix.net/\n\nReally great long-form page talking about text classification\n\nhttp://www.nltk.org/book/ch06.html\n\nI love you guys! Thanks for watching my videos, I do it for you. I left my awesome job at Twilio and I'm doing this full time now. \n\nI recently created a Patreon page.
