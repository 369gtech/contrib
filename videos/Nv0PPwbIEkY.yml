Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nLeveling Up Your CD: Unlocking Progressive Delivery on Kubernetes - Daniel Thomson & Jesse Suen, Intuit \n\nKubernetes Continuous Delivery methods have continued to evolve to more advanced strategies such as canary, A/B testing, and blue-green. Progressive delivery is the next step of CD, enabling service promotion for a subset of users in an automated fashion backed by metrics.  There’s no one-size-fits-all on what are the appropriate metrics to drive promotions. Often, the four golden signals (latency, traffic, errors, saturation) are used, but what if this isn’t enough? More sophisticated techniques might use algorithmic or even AI-driven analysis. The Argo Experiment and Analysis CRDs provides simple constructs to drive automated promotion in an extensible fashion.  This session discusses how Intuit leverages experimentation and analysis, the challenges in providing an automatic but generic approach to analyzing experiments, and envisioning the future of declarative progressive delivery. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Uaaj"
