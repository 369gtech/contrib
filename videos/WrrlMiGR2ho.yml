language: English
recordingDate: 1634568301
description: "This talk was presented during the React Native EU 2021 - the largest community conference in the world focused exclusively on React Native.\n\nAbstract:\nAccessibility shouldn't be a choice that developers should make. It should go without asking. Syncing states, adding the support of screen readers and keyboard interactions can be cumbersome. My team and I have built a set of React hooks that make it easy to build accessible React Native and Web components that complies with the WAI-ARIA standards. It's an adoption of React Aria (by Adobe) in React Native for mobile platforms. The web support is also enabled using React Native Web to make universal components that are accessible by default on all the platforms. We call it React Native Aria. Let's talk about it!\n\nAbout the speaker:\nSanket is the founder of GeekyAnts - a Design and Development studio which is the team behind popular Open Source projects such as NativeBase, BuilderX, SyncState and other.\nHe is on a mission to empower everyone to build things and has spoken at conferences such as ReactNative EU, React Europe, ReactDay Bangalore and others.\nFun fact - he is also amazing at playing the guitar and has a studio at home!\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/sanketsahu\nGitHub: https://github.com/sanketsahusoft\n\nAdditional links:\nSlides:\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/12iQiDhRIfhfCMS5nlZM6CRD2SxDto74V/view?usp=sharing"
