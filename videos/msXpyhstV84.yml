description: "by Vladislav Belov\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/K.4.401/0ad_graphics.webm\n\n\nA story about graphics and graphic problems that we have in development of 0 A. D. - the open-source game of Wildfire Games. \n\nTalking structure: \n\n\nA little history of 0AD (https://play0ad.com/about/the-story-of-0-a-d/) \nUsed technologies and how it works (SDL, OpenGL 1/2, ARB/GLSL shaders) \nKnown problems (inaccurate hardware statistics, old OpenGL, driver/application crashes on Intel cards on different OS, legacy support of OpenGL drivers on macOS 10.14) \nCurrent solutions (tracker &amp; forum to collect people feedback, a feedback server to recieve automatic hardware reports, analyse our audience) \nFuture plans (more abstractions, probably a low-level third party library for GL/Vulkan/Metal, white &amp; black lists for drivers with bugs) \n\n\n\nRoom: K.4.401\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 18:30:00+01"
