description: "Nowadays, live streaming is an essential feature of an internet product. There are tons of examples that show when live streaming can enrich a product: Super-stars connecting with fans, professors broadcasting vivid live courses and live video shopping experiences. \nIn this talk, I‘m going to use React, a component based framework which makes it easy to build and maintain the bricks and blocks for a live streaming web-app. He'll dive into performance optimizations and how you can migrate your product to offer similar functionality and keep up with this trend.\n\nLee is part of the AlloyTeam at Tencent, China. He is working on bootstrapping a live video web-app with React and HLS in order to win over market-share for their product in China.\n\n\nJSConf.Asia - Capitol Theatre, Singapore - 25+26 November 2016\n\nSource: https://2016.jsconf.asia/\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
