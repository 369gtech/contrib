description: "The types of threats facing the enterprise are relatively well understood—malware, advanced persistent threats, and leaked credentials—which are typically addressed by slowing the rate of change, because change is seen as a harbinger of a potential threat. However, these security threats are increasing in volume and speed. In other words, attackers are moving faster, while we are moving slower.\n\nThe answer is to create fundamentally different behaviors within security. Matt Stine offers an overview of the three principles of cloud-native security—rotate user credentials frequently, so they are only useful for a short time; repave servers and applications from a known good state often; and repair vulnerable software as soon as updates are available—and explains how this approach helps you deal with the exponentially increasing volume and velocity of threats. By investing in these new behaviors, you bring the power of cloud-native development and operations approaches to enterprise security and prepare your company to face the new wave of attackers.\n\nThis keynote is sponsored by Pivotal\n\nSubscribe to O'Reilly on YouTube: http://goo.gl/n3QSYi\n\nFollow O'Reilly on: \nTwitter: http://twitter.com/oreillymedia\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/OReilly\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/oreillymedia\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/8459/"
