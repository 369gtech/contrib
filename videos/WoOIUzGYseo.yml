description: "In our September 2018 session, Mark Scardina welcomes Walter Battistella who was responsible for developing the Oracle Hang Management feature that provides autonomous detection and resolution of hangs and deadlocks in Oracle databases. Questions ranged across the full gambit of design, functionality and best its availability in Oracle Database Cloud Services.\n\n02:30  What is Oracle’s goal in developing Hang Manager?\n03:45  What actually is a session hang? \n05:35  What causes a process or session to be hung?\n07:21  Are deadlocks the same as hung sessions or do they differ?\n09:40  Do I need to enable hang manager and if so how? \n10:17  Which versions and deployment types have Hang Manager enabled?\n12:30  How does Hang Manager resolve hangs? \n15:20  What is the overhead of Hang Manager monitoring these sessions? \n18:00  Is Hang Manager in the transaction path? \n18:22  How do I know Hang Manager has detected and resolved a hang or deadlock? \n21:22  How can I get notifications when a hang or deadlock is resolved? \n23:15  Are these notifications available in Enterprise Manager? \n24:00  Does Hang Manager resolve all hangs and deadlocks? \n28:51  I thought Oracle Database already resolved deadlocks prior to 18.1. What is different that Hang Manager does? \n31:30  If I have a critical application , can I speed up the resolution time? \n34:54  I understand that QoS Management lets be set the criticality of workloads. Does Hang Manager use that information? \n37:47  Does Hang Manager monitor PQ sessions as well? If so how does its resolution impact the main session? \n39:15  Does Hang Manager detect and resolve hangs in ASM? \n44:56  Is Hang Manager running on the Oracle Autonomous DB? \n45:22  Does it run in the Oracle Database Cloud Service?\n\nAskTOM Office Hours offers free, monthly training and tips on how to make the most of Oracle Database, from Oracle product managers, developers and evangelists.\n\nhttps://asktom.oracle.com/\n\nOracle Developers portal: https://developer.oracle.com/\nSign up for an Oracle Cloud trial: https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/tryit\n\nMusic by bensound.com"
