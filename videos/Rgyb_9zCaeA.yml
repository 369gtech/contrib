The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nWait, People Run Kubernetes on Mainframes? - Elizabeth K. Joseph, IBM \n\nWhen you think of container orchestration mainframes probably aren't the first thing that come to mind.    But modern mainframes run Linux as a first class citizen and KVM can be used for virtualization, opening a whole world of open source tooling integration via libvirt and related virtualization tooling. The careful observer may have already discovered that the mainframe architecture (s390x) is one of the architectures that's built for every Kubernetes release.    How did this come to be? Who uses these mainframe builds of Kubernetes? Why would you run a distributed container orchestration service on a platform that's a symbol of the monolith we're looking to leave? Drawing upon my work with distributed systems and containers, including time spent on OpenStack, Apache Mesos and Kubernetes, and my new experience with mainframes, this talk answers all of those questions and more. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UaeG"
