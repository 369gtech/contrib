description: "Microsoft's Entity Framework Core (EF Core) library allows anyone who can write C# and LINQ to access a database - no need to write SQL. The problem is, are you getting the best out of EF Core?\n\nIn this session Jon will describe what is going on inside EF Core, because that will help you to write better database access code. This includes database querying, handling relationships, unit testing, Domain-Driven Design, plus looking at the changes brought in with EF Core 3.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks, courses, and conferences in the following links:\nhttps://ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
