title: 'Fireside Chat #14: How do I convince my team to adopt technical practices?'
language: English
recordingDate: 1633021068
description: "In this episode, our co-founders Sandro Mancuso, Mashooq Badar, and Spain Managing Director José E. Rodríguez Huerta discuss how we can convince our teams to adopt technical practices. This is a question we get all the time. Convincing people to work in a different way is very challenging but can also be very rewarding. Why do we often fail to do that? What can we do to improve the chances of introducing new technical practices? This was another very insightful conversation. \n\nIf you would like us to discuss a topic, please let us know in the comments and we will do our best to address it in a future episode. Any topics around Agile, Software Craftsmanship, Extreme Programming, technical practices, thought leadership, architecture, management, team dynamics, or anything related to technology or software projects are welcome. \n\nThe idea of the Fireside chat series is to record many informal conversations we normally have outside working hours. Topics are normally decided just before we start recording. Our objective is to have spontaneous conversations instead of something more structured or scripted. \n\nFor more information about Codurance, please visit our website: https://codurance.com/."
