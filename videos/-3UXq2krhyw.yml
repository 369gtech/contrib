title: 'Design Patterns: Liskov Substitution Principle Explained Practically in C# (The L in SOLID)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1523275201
description: "When you are writing code, are you doing it right? That is a question that worries a lot of people, and it should probably at least be something every developer thinks through. Design patterns are best-practice concepts that we can implement into our code to make it better in some way. Think of them as guardrails that keep our code safe. In this video, we are going to look at the third entry in the famous SOLID principle. The L stands for the Liskov Substitution Principle. We are going to dive into what it means, how it should change our programming practices, and how far we should take it.\n\nNewsletter signup (with exclusive discounts):  https://signup.iamtimcorey.com/ (your email will be kept safe and you will not be spammed).\nSource Code: https://leadmagnets.app/?Resource=LInSOLID"
