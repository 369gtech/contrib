description: "Cloud Foundry AutoScaler Service: Features, Design and Roadmap - Ying Liu, IBM\n\nAuto-Scaling helps you ensure the optimized number of application instances available to handle your workload so as to maintain the service quality and optimize the usage of your cloud resource for cost savings. \n\nCloud Foundry AutoScaler service is a Cloud Foundry incubation project that provides application auto-scaling capability as a cloud foundry service. This project was started one year ago and is now ready for trial in your Cloud Foundry deployment. In this talk, we will firstly have an overview of the features we have right now for both dynamic scaling and scheduled scaling, and then give a walk through of how to deploy the service with BOSH as well as deploy the service as Cloud Foundry applications. We will also show how to define scaling policy and enable auto-scaling by simply create and bind the service to your application. The second part of the talk with focus on the design of the several micro services that AutoScaler service consist of. We will introduce how the micro-services interact with each other and with other subsystems of Cloud Foundry. We will also address the reliability, scalability and security aspects of the design. The last part of the talk will discuss the upcoming features that the team are actively working on and exploring. \n\nAfter this talk, the attendees will know the key concepts of auto-scaling, and being able to deploy, operate and use the AutoScaler service in a Cloud Foundry environment.\n\nAbout Ying Liu\nSenior software engineer, International Business Machine"
