description: "samuel oranyeli\n\nhttps://2020.pycon.org.au/program/FAEAH3\n\nHow do you read data from Excel? How do you read data that has meaningful formats(rows or cells are colour coded)? Or pivot tables that need to be in tidy format? Or data with hierarchical formatting ? This talk will show how to use Pandas, Openpyxl, and some other make-life-easy tools to extract data from Excel into Python in a tidy form and proceed to the next phase of our data analysis.\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, PyConline\n\nFri Sep  4 13:20:00 2020 at Curlyboi"
