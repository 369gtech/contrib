description: "Full Title: How to Prove You're Right: A/B Testing with SciPy \n\nSo you want to run an A/B test! How long should you run it for? How will you know if an observed difference is real? Does it matter what my A/B test is measuring? All of these questions and more can be answered by learning about Hypothesis Testing in SciPy. You might have heard of T-Tests, Chi Squared, and ANOVA in your high school stats class, but you've never heard them explained like this!\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
