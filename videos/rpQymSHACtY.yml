description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nLightning Talk: Parsing CRI JSON logs with Fluent Bit - Bart Robertson & Joseph Fultz, Microsoft\n\nWith dockerd deprecated as a Kubernetes container runtime, we moved to containerd. After the change, our Fluent Bit logging didn't parse our JSON logs correctly. containerd and CRI-O use the CRI Log format which is slightly different and requires additional parsing to parse JSON application logs. This session will detail those differences and present an end-to-end example on how we resolved the issues."
