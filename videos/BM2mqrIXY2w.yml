description: "Did you watch Total Recall and wish you could fuck up JohnnyCab? Driverless vehicles are here at last and practically ripe for the hacking. Autonomous and unmanned systems already patrol our skies and oceans, and are being tested on our streets, highways and sidewalks. All trends indicate these systems are at an inflection point that will show them rapidly becoming commonplace. It is therefore a salient time for a discussion of their capabilities and potential vulnerabilities.\n\nThis session will be an informative and light-hearted look at the current state of civil driverless vehicles and what hackers or other reprobates might do to mess with them. Topics covered will include the full suite of common and proposed sensors, decision profiles and potential failure modes that could be exploited. This talk aims to both inspire unmanned vehicle designers and end users to think about robustness to adversarial and malicious scenarios, and to give the paranoid false hope of resisting the robot revolution.\n\nZoz is a robotics interface designer and rapid prototyping specialist. As co-host of the Discovery Channel show 'Prototype This!' he pioneered urban pizza delivery with robotic vehicles, including the first autonomous crossing of an active highway bridge in the USA, and airborne delivery of life preservers at sea from an autonomous aircraft. He, for one, welcomes our new robot chauffeurs, and would only mess with them out of tough love."
