description: "RustConf 2019 - Monotron - Building a Retro Computer in Embedded Rust by Jonathan Pallant\n\nI missed the simplicity of computers like the C64 and the Apple II and I wondered if I could recreate something like that, but using the inexpensive Cortex-M development board I had lying around on my desk. Can you generate VGA without a video chip? Can you render text without enough RAM to hold a bitmap framebuffer? Can I work out how to decode signals from a PS/2 keyboard? What about SD card support? What about audio output? A real-time clock? MIDI?! Parallel Printer support?!!\n\nI will outline the story of my ongoing obsession to cram as much functionality as possible into 256 KiB of Flash and 32 KiB of SRAM, using the power of Rust to build re-usable, testable components along the way."
