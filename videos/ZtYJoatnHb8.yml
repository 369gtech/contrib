description: "Open Source Developers @ Google Speaker Series: Ben Collins-Sussman and Brian Fitzpatrick\r\n\r\nWhat's In It for Me? How Your Company Can Benefit from Open Sourcing Code\r\n\r\nAs the open source community continues to clamor for more companies to open source their code, more and more executives are asking themselves just what open source can do for their company. There are a number of ways for a company to open source an internal project: from tossing code over the wall on the one hand to running a fully open development project on the other to any combination of the two.\r\n\r\nThis talk will discuss the costs and benefits associated with each method as well as how to successfully launch your new open source project."
