description: "Check out the latest from The Lead Developer at theleaddeveloper.com.\n\nYou've built websites that scaled to millions of users, indexed terabytes of data, and created automatic deployments to thousands of nodes - but now you’re struggling to manage a handful of people. You’re in meetings all day, deadlines are looming, a Board presentation is approaching, your top engineer just disappeared to \"find themselves\" and annual performance reviews are due! How did this spiral out of control so fast? Don’t Panic!\n\nAfter mentoring and managing many tech leads & managers and interviewing top engineering leaders on my podcast, I have found that one of the biggest challenges they face is transitioning to properly scaling themselves.\n\nBeing a successful leader involves utilizing all of the resources available to you and becoming a force multiplier for your team. Learn how to expertly use prioritization, delegation, communication and time management to take control, build confidence, and scale to be a successful software engineering leader."
