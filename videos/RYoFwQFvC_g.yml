description: "Two days of conference. One day of training. More than 350 attendees from all over the globe, over 40 international speakers, 3 stages and lots of squirrels – At Flink Forward Berlin we’ve enjoyed three days full of exciting training sessions, keynotes, technical talks and panels. It was the second Flink Forward organized by data Artisans and we want to thank you for trusting us and making next year’s conferences in San Francisco and Berlin a blast.\n\ndroidcon Berlin – http://droidcon.de\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/dr...\nGoogle+: https://plus.google.com/+dr...\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/droidconDE\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/droid...\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/gr...\nXING: https://www.xing.com/commun...\n\nFind more information on all droidcons worldwide on http://droidcon.com"
