description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nServerless Integration on Kubernetes with Apache Camel K - Nicola Ferraro, Red Hat \n\n“Serverless” is one of the most trending paradigms for designing applications, but what most early adopters find out is that doing something more than a “Hello World!” is hard. The more your application is deconstructed into smaller pieces, the more you need better communication patterns. Real-life applications also interact with tons of external systems and managing this complexity is hard.  Camel K is a lightweight integration platform for Kubernetes created specifically to address these issues. It’s based on Apache Camel, the most powerful open source integration framework, and it leverages Knative to deliver integration patterns in a serverless way.  We will show how Camel K works under the hood and, with coding examples, we’ll also demonstrate how Camel K makes it easy is to connect (almost) anything using integration patterns and the 300+ components that Apache Camel provides.\n\nhttps://sched.co/ZeoP"
