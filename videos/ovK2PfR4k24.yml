description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nLightning Talk: Use SkyWalking Satellite to Process Tracing, Logging and Metrics in Service Mesh - Ming Wen, api7.ai\n\nObservability has always been a thorny issue in service mesh. Users of the service mesh need multi-dimensional data such as logs, metrics, and tracing to analyze the problems they encounter. In traditional solutions, users need to deploy skywalking, Prometheus, and Elasticsearch to handle these issues respectively. In this topic sharing, Ming Wen will introduce the latest version of Skywalking 8.4 and the sub-project of skywalking satellite. Using these two open source projects will help users use a complete and unified solution to process all observable data under service mesh."
