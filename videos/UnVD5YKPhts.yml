description: "http://www.Cppcon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2015\n—\nSession presents Open Service Platform (OSP) - an application server engine inspired by OSGi, consisting of C++ and JavaScript runtime environments; OSP is based on the POCO C++ Libraries, with embedded Google V8 JavaScript engine.\n\nA brief overview of the application server and underlying technologies will be given, followed by dissection of the most interesting implementation details - C++-to-JavaScript bridging mechanism and WebSocket-based messaging mechanism for transparent intra- and inter-process scalable communications. The language bridging mechanism exposes the C++ classes to JavaScript code without a need for manually written glue code or separate IDL constructs for interfaces. The messaging mechanism provides a unified, event-based interface for the in-process entities as well as those reachable over the network - be it TCP/HTTP server or a web browser.\n\nKey design aspects, advantages, as well as trade-offs will be examined; a live example demonstrating key technologies in action will be presented.\n— \nAlex is the POCO (C++ POrtable COmponents, http://pocoproject.org) Project Lead and ISO/IEEE Computer Society Certified Software Development Professional. Alex has been a professional programmer since 1992, using C and C++ since 1998. He earned a master's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Faculty of Engineering (University of Rijeka, Croatia) and a master's degree in Software Engineering from Citadel Graduate College in Charleston, South Carolina. In addition to C++, Alex occasionally writes code in Python and Javascript. He formerly competed in rowing on World Championship/Olympic Games levels. As a diversion, Alex likes to spend his free time traveling, reading, and watching good movies.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
