description: 'When we look at the causes of growing income inequality and the loss of good middle-class jobs, it’s become fashionable to blame the march of technology. Rana Foroohar, Time magazine’s assistant managing editor, columnist, and author of the new book Makers and Takers, has a different diagnosis: the fundamental incentive structures of our financial system. CEOs are rewarded for short-term gains in stock price rather than long-term productive reinvestment. The net result is that companies too often treat workers as a cost to be eliminated rather than an asset to be harnessed to new uses. We’ll talk with Rana about what she calls “the rise of finance and the decline of American business.”'
