description: "Take it from a Sass tool developer and former grid-system author: CSS Variables (custom properties), the calc function, and the grid module are game-changers. These tools may look similar to existing frameworks, but the similarities are only skin deep.\n\nWe’re witnessing a fundamental shift in the design of CSS as a language – allowing us to move beyond “responsive web design” into what Jen Simmons recently called “intrinsic web design”.\n\nThis talk will cover a range of new features, experiments, and advice on use-cases – inspirational for developers of any skill level."
