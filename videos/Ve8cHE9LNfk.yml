description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2017\n—\nThis presentation describes the C++17 standard library parallel algorithms and how they are used. The algorithms are intended for the general software development community rather than addressing a few specialists. \n\nDifferent kinds of parallelism are exposed using corresponding execution policies. Each execution policy implies specific constraints for the use of algorithms to enable the respective parallel approaches. The interface for execution policies is described together with the constraints of the defined execution policies. This presentation discusses the model behind the parallel algorithms and the associated constraints. Some example uses are shown together with results to motivate the importance of enabling parallelism in programs.\n— \nDietmar Kühl: Bloomberg LP, Engineer\n\nDietmar Kühl is a senior software developer at Bloomberg L.P. working on the data distrubtion environment used both internally and by enterprise installations at clients. In the past, he has done mainly consulting for software projects in the finance area. He is a regular attendee of the ANSI/ISO C++ standards committee, frequent presenter at the ACCU conference, and a moderator of the newsgroup comp.lang.c++.moderated.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
