description: "The transition to IPv6 is inevitable. As the amount of users on the internet continues to grow, and continues to grow exponentially, we are simply running out of IPv4.\n\nOwen Delong, IPv6 Evangelist at Hurricane Electric, offered to stop by SF Java and tell us what the future has in store for us. This talk is not just for the Java developer, but is a valuable resource for all developers who touch the network stack.\n\n**More free Java developer resources: http://marakana.com/s/tags/java"
