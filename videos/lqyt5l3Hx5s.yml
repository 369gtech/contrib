description: "When architecting microservice solutions, you'll often find yourself struggling with cross-cutting concerns. Think security, rate limiting, access control, monitoring, location-aware routingâ€¦ Things can quickly become a nightmare.\n\nThe API Gateway pattern can help you solve such problems in an elegant and uniform way. Using Kong, an open source product, you can get started today. In this session we'll look at the why and how of this approach.\n\nDisclaimer: This presentation may include live coding. No humans or animals will be hurt during the process."
