description: "http://g.co/gtac2013\n\nDavid Röthlisberger, YouView\n\nWe'll build a video-capturing image recognition system in 3 minutes, using GStreamer's command-line tools and OpenCV. (GStreamer is an open-source media-handling framework; OpenCV —\"Open Computer Vision\"— is an open-source image-processing library.)\n\nA leading example of such a system is http://stb-tester.com, an open-source tool developed at YouView to automate the UI testing of our set-top boxes. We'll describe stb-tester, the flexibility offered by its GStreamer underpinnings, some of the possibilities it opens up, and the challenges ahead."
