description: "Today, everybody knows how to deploy a binary, whatever the host. But how do you handle the configuration? By hand? Arf, shame on you, you did half of the job. You embed it into your container? Bad idea...\n\nSpring config server is a solution that allows you to automatically manage your configuration, whatever the environment. More, by using Hashicorp Vault, you'll be able to put your credentials in your properties files in a safe way.\n\nFinally, we'll also see how to use Consul storage to retrieve your configuration using Spring.\n\nPierre-Jean Vardanéga\nI'm a java software craftsman. I use to develop web applications. My favorite topics are xDD, Event sourcing, CQRS and all Spring ecosystem.\n\n[CJZ-6085]"
