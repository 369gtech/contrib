description: "Google Tech Talks\r\nOctober 20, 2008\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nThe advent of multicores presents a promising opportunity for speeding up sequential programs via profile-based speculative parallelization of these programs. In this talk I will present a novel solution for efficiently supporting software speculation on multicore processors. Our execution model maintains the state of speculative parallel threads separately from the non-speculative state. Thus, if speculation is successful, the results of the speculative computation are committed by copying them to the non-speculative state. If misspeculation is detected, the speculative state is simply discarded. A lightweight mechanism that maintains version numbers for non-speculative data values enables misspeculation detection. Through profile-based speculative parllelization of a set of programs, our approach achieves speedups ranging from 3.7 to 7.8 on a Dell PowerEdge 1900 server with two Intel Xeon quad-core processors. \r\n\r\nSpeaker: Rajiv Gupta\r\nRajiv Gupta is a Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at the Univ. of California, Riverside.
