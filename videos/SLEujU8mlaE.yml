title: '"Building a zero downtime Kubernetes cluster" - Feilong Wang (LCA 2020)'
recordingDate: 1579222208
description: "Feilong Wang\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/50/\n\nHaving recently gone through the experience of building, implementing and running a Kubernetes platform service in its public cloud, Catalyst Cloud has some interesting experiences and war stories to share about the journey. One of the most in-demand for a Kubernetes service's features is monitoring of the cluster’s health and ability of the orchestrator to deal with unhealthy instances and triggering replacements when needed, maximizing the cluster’s efficiency and performance.\r\n\r\nThis presentation and demo are targeted for anybody interested in having closed-loop automation for self-healing and maintenance in a Kuberntes cluster. Attendees will learn how this can be achieved with zero downtime for the user's application. And there are some good tips will be shared about how to runn auto scaling, rolling upgrade and auto healing for Kubernetes cluster.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
