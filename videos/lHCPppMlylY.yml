description: "Spring Batch 3.0.0 introduces JSR-352 support, among other features. Adopting a Java EE standard that was directly based on Spring Batch to begin with is fortunately, fairly straightforward for us. JavaEE7 compliance updates and expands the scope of Spring Batch 3.0.0 to combine JavaEE7/352 compliance with years of Batch's battle-tested, proven-in-production codebase. Of course, there is a wealth of capability and features that go far beyond the specification into distributed processing and beyond. \n\nIn this webinar, project lead Michael Minella will cover Spring Batch's implementation of JSR-352 as well as some of the new features in the 3.0 release."
