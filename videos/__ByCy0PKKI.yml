description: "Machine Learning powers almost every internet service we use these days, but it's rare to find a full pipeline example of machine learning being deployed in a web app. In this episode, I'd like to present 5 full-stack machine learning demos submitted as midterm projects from the students of my current course. The midterm assignment was to create a paid machine learning web app, and after receiving countless incredible submissions, I've decided to share my favorite 5 publicly. I was surprised by how many students in the course had never coded before and to see them building a full-stack web app in a few weeks was a very fulfilling experience. Use these examples as a template to help you ideate on potential business ideas to make a positive impact in the world using machine learning. And if you'd like, be sure to reach out and support each of the students I've demoed here today in any way can you offer. They've been working their butts off. Enjoy! \n\nPresentation notebook: \nhttps://colab.research.google.com/drive/1m5aLHPnwIhVX8zgMvZUtK4iG9xSaMbk8\n\nExample 1 (Medicine): Dermatitis Detection\nhttps://github.com/MichaelChoudhury/dermatitisDetector\n\nExample 2 (Entertainment): Script Generator\nhttps://github.com/rgreschner/siraj-make-money-with-machine-learning-midterm-tng-scriptgen\n\nExample 3 (Finance): Price Prediction\nhttps://github.com/akmuthun/crypto_predictor_app\n\nExample 4 (Recruiting): Resume Scanner\nhttps://github.com/ZhengTzer/resume-scanner/blob/master/app.py\n\nExample 5 (Security): Threat Detection\nhttps://github.com/shoumikgoswami/Detect-X-app\n\nAre you a total beginner to machine learning?
