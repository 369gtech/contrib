description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2017\n—\nconstexpr: in C++11, a curiosity; in C++14, viable for more uses; now with added power, in C++17 will it become an important tool in the programmer's toolkit? \n\nIn this talk we will examine the possibilities and power of constexpr and explore what can (and what should) be done at compile-time with C++17. We'll present techniques for building constexpr data structures and algorithms, and look at what the standard provides and where it can improve. We'll also explore constexpr use of user defined literals for expressive compile-time abstractions. \n\nCompile-time computation offers perhaps the ultimate zero-cost abstraction, and this talk attempts to gauge the power available with C++17 constexpr. \n— \nBen Deane: Principal Software Engineer, Blizzard Entertainment\n\nBen has been writing games for almost 20 years, and in C++ for most of that. He is currently a Principal Engineer at Blizzard Entertainment where he works on the Battle.net team. He's always looking for useful new techniques in C++, and he likes functional programming.\n\nJason Turner: Developer, Trainer, Speaker\n\nHost of C++Weekly https://www.youtube.com/c/JasonTurner-lefticus, Co-host of CppCast http://cppcast.com, Co-creator and maintainer of the embedded scripting language for C++, ChaiScript http://chaiscript.com, and author and curator of the forkable coding standards document http://cppbestpractices.com. \n\nI'm available for contracting and onsite training.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
