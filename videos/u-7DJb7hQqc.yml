Due to class paradigm of C++, many STL containers have a flat layout in memory, i.e. containers naturally store objects and address objects rather than their indexing entities such as smart pointers (which are, strictly speaking, objects too). This model has a benefit of lower memory fragmentation, that causes better CPU cache performance. However, many tasks in real life require reordering of objects, that requires compexity of O(n*q), where q is a size of an object and n is a compexity measured in operations. Thus, some imlementations of operations with reordering objects in some containers are much slower that they could be. This problem could sometimes be solved by storing “pointers” as index entities in containers instead of the objects by themselves, what improves performance by q times, but causes memory fragmentation and worse cache performance. Algorithmically, the solution with pointers is obviously better, but it is still not the most efficient one. In the presentation I will show myimplementations of containers using both approaches and having the best of two worlds. I will compare these methods with classical and modern approaches and draw some conclusion, encouraging everybody to use the power of algorithms with C++.\n— \nViktor graduated from Moscow Technical University and Yandex Data Analysis School.\nIn 2006 - 2008 Viktor worked for Galaktika corpotation, participated in the creation of a 4'th generation OO-programming language.\nIn 2008 - 2010 Viktor worked for Alta-Soft LLC as a technical architect of a distributed customs database.\nSince 2012 Viktor has been working for Zeptolab LLC, creating modern mobile games. At the moment the company is drastically updating the technologies and codebase, including an internal framework.\nViktor is always making an emphasis on algorithms, fundamental data structures and robust object model.\n\nMobius 2015, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TG1QVXUFJG4\nDroidcon 2014, http://ru.droidcon.com/2014/gaming-i/\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
