description: "We always value this notion that technology makes our lives easier. We love open source because it democratizes the creation and use of software. But as community members, developers and consumers, we know technology also can increasingly conspire against us.  \n\nCase and point, Snyk just revealed that there’s been an 88% increase in application library vulnerabilities over two years - imagine what it will be in five? According to a Forrester, 58% of enterprise organizations suffered a breach at least once in the previous year, and over 41% of those external breaches exploited some software vulnerability. These stats only touch on the security challenges we face today. No one wants to make the headline news for a security incident - particularly one that could have been avoided. No longer can companies or developers view security as an afterthought. Security snafus can lead to huge costs and major reputation blows and you have a role in ensuring they don’t. The question is in the ever-changing technology environment we live in, how will you do that?\n\nThe answer is through maturing your DevOps practices (or moving to what some are increasingly calling DevSecOps). Whatever the name, the need for security integration to be a deeper part of any team is as, if not more, essential than the ability to deliver features quickly. The good news is as we’ve recently validated that in mature DevOps practices security is inherent and DevOps practices promote better security posture. Don't be left behind (or find yourself on the front pages for all the wrong reasons).\n\nThis keynote will address:\n- The role that you have in ensuring the security posture for your company\n- The important role that automation plays in setting the framework for DevOps (DevSecOps) and improving a company’s security profile.\n- How to successfully evolve along your DevOps journey and inherently build in more security (along with the challenges you can expect along the way.\n\nEVENT:\nOpenSource Summit 2019\n\nSPEAKER:\nYvonne Wassenaar, Chief Executive Officer, Puppet\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed)\n\nATTRIBUTION CREDITS:\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOii0t2fdlI"
