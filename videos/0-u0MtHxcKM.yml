description: "Grads are your future - it's time to invest!\n\nHow awesome would it be if you could easily hire switched on developers who are highly engaged, hungry to learn, challenge the status quo, drive positive cultural change and are not burdened with skepticism from former employers? Starting a graduate program may sound like a lot of hard work, but even a low-fi implementation can produce far-reaching benefits. \n\nIn this session, you will hear about SEEK's journey towards a successful and sustainable graduate program. Learn why and how we got started, how it has evolved and the unanticipated benefits our graduates have brought. Along the way, we will discuss practical steps to ensure your graduate intake is diverse, your graduates get targeted, practical technical training and you are building an inclusive culture to support their career development.\n\nI am a software developer with a few decades experience and I'm passionate about growing people and teams, building strong cultures, coaching better technical practices and driving continuous improvement. \n\nFor more on YOW!
