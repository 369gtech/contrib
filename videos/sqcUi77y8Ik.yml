description: "Can your applications scale as needed? Can you continuously deliver mission critical applications while reducing risks? \r\nIn this session, we’ll demonstrate some new, exciting Azure Resource Manager capabilities including deployment orchestration, health integration during deployments, and other features that dramatically reduce risk associated with large-scale service rollouts. We’ll review Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS) - one of the fastest growing services in Azure - powering many mission-critical applications. And we’ll take a deeper look at some important configuration choices and related trade-offs, explain why and when you should use them — with actual customer scenarios — and what you should expect as a result."
