language: English
recordingDate: 1563562530
description: "Mohit Suley, Microsoft, and Kurt Andersen, LinkedIn\n\nAn SRE who understands the business her company is in will be enabled to effectively communicate with various levels of management and understand how their day to day work impacts the success of the company. With this perspective, you can seek global optimization in ways that transcend simple availability. Being fluent with these concepts will support your career growth also.\n\nWhy should you care if your company makes any money? Business metrics do not need to be a mysterious world that is maintained by people with MBAs. Technical people will find both corporate and personal benefit in their careers by expanding their focus to include business fundamentals which are affected by services they run.\n\nBusiness metrics are all oriented around two main axes: who your customers are, and how you make money. All of the mysterious acronyms and abbreviations are just different ways of mixing and matching those two components along with time.\n\nAttendees will walk away with a clear understanding of standard business metrics and how they relate to Site Reliability. We will use simplified examples of different business models to show the application of these metrics across multiple domains.\n\nView the full SREcon19 Asia/Pacific program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon19asia/program\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
