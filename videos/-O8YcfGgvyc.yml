title: 'GeeCON 2019: Kamil Owczarek - Data Streaming: Which horse to bet on?'
recordingDate: 1563984103
description: 'Data streaming has been mainstream in the development world for a few years already, bringing us lots of mature frameworks, like: Spark Streaming, Flink, Akka Streams or Kafka Streams. This abundance is always welcome, but can also be confusing, when having to pick one with lowest latency, highest throughput or best CPU / memory utilization. The aim of this talk is to provide a reliable response to those dilemmas as much as it is possible.'
