description: "Google Tech Talks\nNovember 21, 2006\n\nABSTRACT\n\nInformation technology advances are making data collection possible in most if not all fields of science and engineering and beyond. Statistics as a scientific discipline is challenged and enriched by the new opportunities resulted from these high-dimensional data sets. Often data reduction or feature selection is the first step towards solving these massive data problems. However, data reduction through model selection or l_0 constrained least squares optimization leads to a combinatorial search which is computationally infeasible for massive data problems. A computationally efficient alternative is the l_1 constrained least squares optimization or..."
