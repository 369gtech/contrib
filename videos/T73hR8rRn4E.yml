title: 'Getting the best out of React & Redux rendering - Rokas Mikalkevičius'
recordingDate: 1527662689
description: "React’s easy and intuitive API allows us to forget the browser and rendering of the content. But what should be done when we want to push our rendering speeds to the limits? How to avoid unnecessary renders and make our content appear faster?\n\nTo answer those and other questions, Rokas will dig into React’s rendering mechanism and see how Redux can help us achieve the best results."
