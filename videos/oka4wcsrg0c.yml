description: "My Vim config now totals over 75,000 lines of VimScript. That's utter madness, of course. But there is method in it.\n\nAbout 1/3 of those lines are specifically aimed at helping me write, maintain, navigate, and test my Perl code. My Vim configuration now automatically loads file templates, highlights syntax errors in realtime, intelligently searches for documentation, autocompletes syntactic constructs with snippet-like placeholders, autoaligns key/value lists, wraps long lines much more readably, summarizes subroutines, tracks and explains variables, searches and helps navigate source files across multiple directories, finds and executes module test suites, colour-codes STDOUT and STDERR, and even autoselects the right version of Perl for each program.\n\nIn this talk I'll explain how my .vimrc does all this, and show you how to obtain and configure the various Vim plugins and Perl modules that make it possible.\n\nDamian Conway is a 52-year-old Australian male, wanted in connection with various outrages and atrocities committed on CPAN over the past two decades, as well as numerous assaults on the sanity of Perl audiences across four continents."
