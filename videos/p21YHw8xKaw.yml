However, Power Platform is also rich with capabilities enabling greater speed and effectiveness for pro developers.  In this session, we’ll focus on the variety of Pro Developer features available in the Power Platform, and how Pro Developers can harness these capabilities to rapidly create applications. We will also discuss the unique ability of the Power Platform to support a deep synergy between Pro Developers and Citizen Developers who can more easily work together to accelerate an organization’s development efforts.\n\nMicrosoft Learn -- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/power-plat-fundamentals/?WT.mc_id=Build2020_presentation_additionalresources\nMicrosoft Docs -- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/?WT.mc_id=Build2020_presentation_additionalresources\nChannel 9 -- https://channel9.msdn.com/?WT.mc_id=Build2020_presentation_additionalresources\nIntroduction to Power Platform developer resources -- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/introduction-developing-power-platform/?WT.mc_id=Build2020_presentation_additionalresources\nUse developer tools to extend the Power Platform -- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/use-developer-tools-extend/?WT.mc_id=Build2020_presentation_additionalresources\n\n\nRelated Sessions\nBOD133 -- https://mybuild.microsoft.com/sessions/BOD133?wt.mc_id=yt_PLlrxD0HtieHhlbuh4wiUVHGeVw8vY4Rco"
