description: "The internet of things is turning the internet upside down, and the effects are causing all kinds of problems. We have to answer questions about how to have data where we want it and computation where we need itâ€”and we have to coordinate and control all of this while maintaining visibility and security. Ted Dunning shares solutions for this problem from across multiple industries and businesses.\n\nThis keynote is sponsored by MapR.\n\nSubscribe to O'Reilly on YouTube: http://goo.gl/n3QSYi\n\nFollow O'Reilly on \nTwitter: http://twitter.com/oreillymedia\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/OReilly\nGoogle: http://plus.google.com/+oreillymedia"
