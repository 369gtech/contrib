title: '"TPP:  From Dumb, to Specific, to Generic" with Javier Charcana'
language: English
recordingDate: 1636040866
description: "When taught TDD, especially at the beginning of our journey, we’ve all faced the question: “Why is this so dumb?“.\n\nMore frequently than what one would want, we are forced to write silly code, fake implementations, or just “the minimum code required”.\n\nOn the other hand, there are times when we have an algorithm formed in our minds, and we are so sure about it, we end up skipping tests.\n\nThe Transformation Priority Premise (or TPP) is an effort for a formalization to guide test-driven developers into choosing the best next test and the best possible implementation at that particular moment.\n\nBy going through a few examples, we will see the evolution of code, and how a decision can make our solution go in a completely different way.\n\nWe will see that the “minimum code required” is not as random and silly as we first thought, and that there is a proposed structured approach we can follow.\n\nThe format: A 40-minute guided hands-on workshop followed by a Q&A session\n\nThursday's Matter is a virtual meetup on the topics that truly matter to today's developers.\n\nLearn more at skillsmatter.com/thursdays"
