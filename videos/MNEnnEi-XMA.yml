description: "With one config file you can tidy and lint Perl, JavaScript, Go, and many more languages and file formats. If a plugin for your needs doesn't already exist, writing a new one is trivial. Tame your compulsive need to fiddle with the formatting on every line with tidyall.\n\nIn this talk I'll show you some configuration examples, explain the plugin system, and demonstrate how to integrate Code::TidyAll with source control, your test suite, and your editor.\n\nSlides are at https://www.houseabsolute.com/presentations/github/tidy-all-the-things/#/"
