language: English
recordingDate: 1491841554
description: '#Codemotion Rome 2017 - This talk uses the framework of technical SCUBA and rebreather diving to talk about patterns for failure management and how they can be applied towards engineering. It examines the ways that complex systems fail and challenges our heroism-based model of success which ignores consistent, uneventful execution. It also looks into different approaches to risk management and why the typical model that we depend on is not safe. You will walk away with an understanding of how failure cascades occur and how to protect your system and your team from failure.'
