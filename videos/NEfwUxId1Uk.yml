description: "Tutorial: Bullet-Proof Kubernetes: Learn by Hacking - Luke Bond, ControlPlane & Ana-Maria Calin, Paybase \n\nLearn how to attack, exploit, and hack Kubernetes clusters and application workloads. In this workshop attendees are divided into teams, given a crash-course in Kubernetes cluster security, and then set loose on a series of vulnerable clusters in a competitive capture the flag. Full methods, solutions, and vulnerabilities are revealed, along with actionable mitigation steps to enhance a clusterâ€™s security and lock down common misconfigurations. It is designed to develop the kind of expertise only realised in production environments. Emphasis is placed on collaboration and communication, which are key to unlocking some of the advanced flags. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPgo"
