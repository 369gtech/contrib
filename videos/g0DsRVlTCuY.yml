description: "DevOpsDays Baltimore 2019 - Personal DevOps by Karl Davis\n\nWe're all here because we want to try and improve our team's productivity. Sometimes, though, the best place to start is with ourselves. I'll show you how I apply DevOps practices like improving communication, tracking metrics that matter, and more -- to try and get the most out of each work day.\n\n#confreaks #devopsdaysbmore"
