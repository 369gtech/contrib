description: "I’m an SRE Lead! Now What? How to Bootstrap and Organize Your SRE Team\n\nRitchie Schacher, SRE Architect, IBM Bluemix DevOps Services, and Rob Orr, IBM\n\nSo, your organization has decided to build an SRE team, and you are one of the leaders. You have multiple stakeholders with different expectations and agendas. Your executive team expects early and immediate results. They want checklists, goals, and roadmaps, and they want it now. Peer dev managers may believe that you now have a magic wand that will make their headaches disappear, or worse, may believe that they can offload all the dev team’s dirty work to you. \n\nAre you overwhelmed, and wondering how to get started? How will you organize? How will you manage expectations? What management style should you use? How will you define and measure success? \n\nIn this session, we will cover a phased approach to organize your SRE team based on our real-world experience operating our cloud-based SaaS DevOps toolset. We will also cover some of our lessons learned and pitfalls for you to avoid to help you on your SRE journey.\n\nView the full SREcon17 Americas Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon17americas/program"
