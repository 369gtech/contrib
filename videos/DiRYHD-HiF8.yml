description: ".NET Summit 2020 Online Edition https://dotnetsummit.by - the 4th community driven .NET conference dedicated to practical experience of solving business challenges with .NET and technical challenges in .NET application.\n\nFlorian Verdonck, Formatting F# source code [EN]\n\n\"Having a good formatter for your source code seems like a well established concept for many languages in these modern times. Prettier for JavaScript for example is a joy to work with.\nThe formatting story for F# is different one. There is project called Fantomas, which was started in 2013 and sadly it lost its main contributor. Until it was rejuvenated in 2018 by a dynamic duo in the F# mentorship program.\nIn this talk I'd like to share my journey from my first pull request to becoming a maintainer of Fantomas.\nDiscussing the technical aspects as well as the road to ownership\".\n\nGeneral Partner - ISsoft - https://issoft.by"
