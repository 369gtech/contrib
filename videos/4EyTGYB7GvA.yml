description: "Modern CI/CD with Tekton and Prow Automated via Jenkins X - James Rawlings, Cloudbees & Christie Wilson, Google \n\nThereâ€™s been lots of innovation in the CI/CD space around the Kubernetes ecosystem, with the introduction of Tekton (formerly Knative) Pipeline and it's deep integration with Prow from the Kubernetes testing sig. This session will show you how to get started with Pipeline on your own clusters for your CI/CD needs, leveraging Prow for webhooks and powerful ChatOps capabilities on pull requests and issues. The live demo will also show we can use Jenkins X to orchestrate and automate building applications leveraging both Pipeline and Prow, so that we can all benefit from the awesome innovation. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPZ4"
