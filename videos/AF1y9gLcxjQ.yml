title: 'Creating NuGet Packages the easy way with .NET Standard in C#'
language: English
recordingDate: 1563192002
description: "NuGet packages are a way to share versioned code with the world. If you have done any development in C#, you have used NuGet packages, even if you didn't know it. Almost every template in Visual Studio is made up of NuGet packages. That allows us to create flexible applications that upgrade parts of itself without upgrading everything. For instance, if a new version of Dapper comes out, I can continue to use the old version or I can upgrade to the new version. If I have a problem with the new version, I can roll back to the old version.\n\nWe take these packages for granted but while almost every developer uses NuGet packages, relatively few ever create NuGet packages. Part of that comes from not thinking about code reusability beyond a given project but a large part of it comes from not knowing how to create NuGet packages. Today, we are going to address that second issue, and at least touch on the first one. \n\nNuGet packages have become so easy to create, we will actually spend more time on deploying, managing, and hosting our packages then we will on creating them.\n\nPatreon (special bonus for $10/month patrons by July 31st): https://www.patreon.com/IAmTimCorey\n\nMailing List signup (with exclusive discounts, giveaways, and more):  https://signup.iamtimcorey.com/\n\nPackage Properties List: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/nuspec"
