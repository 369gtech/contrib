title: 'Jonathon Morgan: Machine Learning and Information Warfare'
recordingDate: 1542729606
description: 'We''ve entered an age of information war. Hyper-partisan rhetoric, social media filter bubbles, and massive networks of fake social media accounts are being used to undermine elections, sow discord, and even inspire acts of violence. We can quantify this manipulation and its impact using new and novel approaches to natural language understanding and information semantics. We''ll look at how knowledge graph embeddings can help humans quickly identify computational propaganda, and investigate how word vectors from models trained on partisan corpora can measure radicalization and polarization in political discourse. - Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/crunch'
