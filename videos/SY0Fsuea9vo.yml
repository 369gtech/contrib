description: "James Waite (Gibbs Hybrid): Talent & Technology\n\nA fast-paced overview of the technologies that are changing the future of work. Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, the Blockchain – to name a few disruptive technologies – are revolutionising the labour landscape. James Waite will explore how we find work and manage our careers – it is becoming ever more automated and more complex. How do we overcome our resistance to automation? James will ask big questions about finding the right talent and how companies can keep talented people, and as a technology professional, how you can embrace the automisation and digitisation of job search and make the most of your own personal brand and skills. James will also showcase some specific solutions Gibbs Hybrid are working on that are sure to be thought provoking and stimulating.\n\nThe speech was given on 2018-05-23 at infoShare 2018 (Tech Stage) in Gdańsk.\n\nMore info: http://infoshare.pl \nFollow us: https://facebook.com/infosharepl\nhttps://twitter.com/infosharepl\nhttps://instagram.com/infoshare/\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/1272775/\nhttps://plus.google.com/+infoshare/"
