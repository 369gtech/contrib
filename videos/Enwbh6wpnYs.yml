title: 'Comparison Method Violates Its General Contract! (Part 1) by Stuart Marks'

description: "Why does sorting sometimes throw this exception? What does it mean? And why does it sometimes occur and sometimes work fine?\n\nThe answer is in the Comparator interface. A Comparator has one task: to compare two objects. What could be simpler? There are many ways to get it wrong. Writing a complex Comparator is tedious and error-prone. A single mistake can lead to the dreaded error.\n\nIn this talk, we take a detailed look at Comparators and examine how to write a correct Comparator. We cover several common pitfalls. We also cover some utility methods introduced in Java 8 that make it easy to compose complex Comparators from simpler ones. These enable you to write correct, sophisticated Comparators much more quickly and easily.\n\n# Stuart Marks\nStuart Marks is a Principal Member of Technical Staff in the Java Platform Group at Oracle.
