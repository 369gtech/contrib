description: "From Tech Lead to Motherhood : One woman’s journey from changing systems to changing nappies - and back again\n\nOur industry undeniably suffers from a lack of gender balance amongst hands-on technologists. Even fewer of those technologists are mothers. Sadly, many women believe that you can’t remain technical once you become a mother. But there are small changes that we as leaders can make to support our team members as they transition back into the workforce.\n\nIn this talk, Sarah will share with you her experience, including the challenges she faced, of returning to a senior technical role after starting a family. You will hear the changes she made within her company to make it easier for others to see how to return and stay technical, and the benefits to her company of having her and others like her able to return to work.\n\nSarah hopes her experience will provide some inspiration and practical advice to share with your software engineers and tech leads who are contemplating motherhood, and for leaders who are committed to supporting diversity in their workplace.\n\nSarah is a Technical Principal Consultant at ThoughtWorks. She is a developer, coach, architect, technical lead, mother. Working part time progressing through her career whilst raising and supporting three preschoolers has given her a unique perspective in what it means to have it all - family, career, life.\n\nFor more on YOW!
