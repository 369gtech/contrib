title: 'NSDI ''14 - Recursively Cautious Congestion Control'

description: "Recursively Cautious Congestion Control\n\nRadhika Mittal, Justine Sherry, and Sylvia Ratnasamy, University of California, Berkeley; Scott Shenker, University of California, Berkeley, and International Computer Science Institute\n\nTCP’s congestion control is deliberately cautious, avoiding network overloads by starting with a small initial window and then iteratively ramping up. As a result, it often takes flows several round-trip times to fully utilize the available bandwidth. In this paper we propose RC3, a technique to quickly take advantage of available capacity from the very first RTT. RC3 uses several levels of lower priority service and a modified TCP behavior to achieve near-optimal throughputs while preserving TCP-friendliness and fairness. We implement RC3 in the Linux kernel and in NS-3. In common wide-area scenarios, RC3 results in over 40% reduction in average flow completion times, with strongest improvements—more than 70% reduction in flow completion time—seen in medium to large sized (100KB-3MB) flows.\n\nView the full NSDI '14 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi14/technical-sessions"
