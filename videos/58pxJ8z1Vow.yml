description: "AnyPixel.js is an open source software and hardware library created here at Google, making it possible to use the web to create big, unusual, interactive displays out of all kinds of things. Anyone can take the code and the schematics to create their own display at any scale or level of expertise.  \n \nThe first display using this platform is in the 8th Avenue lobby at the Google NYC office. To create this installation, we used 5880 off-the-shelf arcade buttons as our pixels. \n\nLearn more about the project and how to create your own AnyPixel.js display at https://goo.gl/anypixel"
