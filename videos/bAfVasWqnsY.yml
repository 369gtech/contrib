description: "You may have heard that Machine Learning is setting the world alight. The advancements in processing power and data availability have made AI progress at an unprecedented pace. You want to benefit from it in your projects, but you're getting the impression that with all the math it's too hard?\nIn this talk, I'll do very best to combat that impression. Join me on a trip to build and train a basic prediction model and understand how it all works. I'll also show you cloud solutions that you can quickly incorporate into your projects. Being a mathematician is not required!\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com\nhttps://ndccopenhagen.com"
