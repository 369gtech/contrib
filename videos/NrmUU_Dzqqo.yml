description: 'I''m going to talk about how JSConf changed my life, and changes the life of those who I meet. When I first went to JSConf I didn''t even go to JSConf. I went to ScurvyConf in 2010 and it inspired me. You can check the WHOIS for nodejitsu.com and you can see that it was registered on April 19th, 2010, just a day after the event. Over the years JSConf continued to inspire me so much that I started EmpireJS and now EmpireNode. These events themselves have spawned other amazing stories.'
