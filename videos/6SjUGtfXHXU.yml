description: "DevOpsDays Boston 2018 - Craft as in Beer: The Value of Community by  Aaron Aldrich\n\nInstead of talking “Free as in beer”, let’s talk “Craft as in beer.” Not too long ago the entire beer market was set to be two companies, Anheuser-Busch and Miller-Coors, but plucky little startup brewers have not only survived, but thrived. On a similar time-scale, most software was being developed in large development houses behind closed doors. Open Source was largely thought of as an unsustainable mistake. Now, small open source projects pop up every day and even successful companies are based entirely on Open Source Software. How is this possible?\n\nThe overlap here: Building Strong Communities.\n\nWhat is the value of community?\nHow can we still practice sharing if we can’t share our code?\nWhere can we start building this community?"
