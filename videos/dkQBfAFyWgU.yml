description: "\"Ripples on the Pond\" by Elizabeth Naramore\n\nThe actions we take in our everyday lives can have profound impacts on the world around us. The choice is ours. What will you do with the time you have here on Earth? How will you use what you learn? What kind of legacy will you leave? How will you treat those who are just starting out? In this keynote, weâ€™ll talk about the complexities of the human brain, the power of choice and knowledge, and how the tiniest actions can make the biggest ripples on the tech community pond."
