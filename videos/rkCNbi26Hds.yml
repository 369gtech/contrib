description: "The Fourth Conference on Artificial General Intelligence\r\nMountain View, California, USA\r\nAugust 3-6, 2011\r\n\r\nJürgen Schmidhuber's short talk on fast deep neural networks at AGI 2011 at Google Headquarters, CA.\r\nCo-authors: Dan Ciresan, Ueli Meier, Jonathan Masci, Alex Graves.\r\n\r\nThe deep / recurrent neural networks of Schmidhuber's team keep winning important visual pattern recognition competitions, and are starting to achieve human-competitive results:\r\n\r\n9. August 2011: IJCNN 2011 on-site Traffic Sign Recognition Competition (0.56% error rate, nearly three times better than 2nd best algorithm - the only method outperforming humans)\r\n8. June 2011: ICDAR 2011 offline Chinese Handwriting Recognition Competition (1st & 2nd rank)\r\n7. MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognition Benchmark (perhaps the most famous machine learning benchmark). New record (0.35% error rate) in 2010, improved to 0.31% in March 2011, then 0.27% for ICDAR 2011\r\n6. NORB Object Recognition Benchmark. New record (2.53% error rate) in 2011\r\n5. CIFAR-10 Object Recognition Benchmark. New records in 2011, now down to 12% error rate\r\n4. January 2011: Online German Traffic Sign Recognition Contest (1st & 2nd rank; 1.02% error rate)\r\n3. ICDAR 2009 Arabic Connected Handwriting Competition, like the others below won by LSTM recurrent nets (deep by nature).\r\n2. ICDAR 2009 Handwritten Farsi/Arabic Character Recognition Competition\r\n1. ICDAR 2009 French Connected Handwriting Competition based on data from the RIMES campaign\r\n\r\nOverview sites with more information and scientific papers:\r\n\r\nComputer vision with fast deep / recurrent neural networks: http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/vision.html\r\nHandwriting recognition with fast deep / recurrent neural nets: http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/handwriting.html\r\nFormal Theory of Fun & Creativity & Intrinsic Motivation http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/creativity.html\r\nArtificial curiosity -  how to build artificial scientists and artists: http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/interest.html\r\nOptimal Universal Artificial Intelligence: http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/unilearn.html\r\nSelf-referential Gödel Machines as universal problem solvers: http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/goedelmachine.html\r\nArtificial Evolution: http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/evolution.html\r\nUnsupervised Learning: http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/ica.html\r\nHierarchical Learning: http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/subgoals.html\r\nReinforcement Learning: http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/rl.html\r\nRobot Learning: http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/learningrobots.html\r\nSource code of machine learning algorithms at Pybrain: http://pybrain.org/\r\nHome page: http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/\r\nWhat's new: http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/whatsnew.html"
