description: "Recorded at Global AppSec DC 2019\nhttps://dc.globalappsec.org/\n\n\nMaking a Change, One at a time - Diversity: More than just Gender\n\nThere has been a lot of conversations around diversity and inclusion in the recent past.  This is a step in a positive direction. The benefits of diversity in cybersecurity are clear. As an industry, we can do better, we need to do better. We need not only to keep the conversation going but to really place some action behind it. While homogenous teams feel easier to operate in, it can lead to stagnation, or specialisations in some aspects at the expense of others.\n\nIn this talk, I will present some of my thoughts on the importance and benefits of diversity and inclusion in our industry. I will share some of my experiences working over the last few years towards diversity initiatives, some real change observed, challenges associated with it and small steps anyone can do to improve diversity.\n\n\nVandana Verma\n\nIBM India Software Labs\nSecurity Architect\n\nVandana is a seasoned security professional with over a decade worth of experience ranging from application security to infrastructure and now dealing with cloud security.
