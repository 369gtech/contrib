title: 'MethodHandles Everywhere by Charles Nutter'
recordingDate: 1519313108
description: "Method handles, Java's fast function pointers and functional adapters, were added in Java 7 to support new language features. Since then, they've been leveraged to make not only fast dynamic languages, but a richer set of features for Java itself. In this talk we will explore how you can use handles to improve your apps and libraries. We'll see how they wire up and optimize. And we'll play with the new loop and variable pointer handles in Java 9. If you've ever been curious about java.lang.invoke.*, this is the talk for you.\n\nCharles Nutter, Red Hat\nCharles Oliver Nutter has been co-lead of the JRuby project for the past seven years, working on performance and Java integration, and helping to coordinate community efforts. During that time JRuby has become a premier platform for Ruby users, allowing both a gateway to Java-centric organizations as well as an excellent Ruby implementation. Charles hopes to expand JRuby's success to other JVM languages, building the JVM into the best platform for multi-language development. Charlie is employed working on JRuby full time at Red Hat.\n\nRecorded at Jfokus 2018\nhttps://www.jfokus.se/jfokus18/schedule.jsp"
