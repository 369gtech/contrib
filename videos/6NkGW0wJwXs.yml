description: "Recording brought to you by American Express. https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs\nGoing from imperative, blocking code to a reactive programming model enables us to scale our apps in ways that aren't possible with a thread scale-out approach, which is a good thing! But as with all optimizations, one must examine & address the system holistically or all we accomplish is moving bottlenecks around, creating or finding new chokepoints as we tune certain applications/services. This is *not* so good.\n\nIn this session, the presenter discusses:\n* How Project Reactor builds on reactive streams to help you create performant & scalable reactive microservices\n* Message brokers & streaming platforms like RabbitMQ & Apache Kafka\n* How Spring Cloud Stream leverages Reactor to provide fully reactive pipelines for system-wide (ridiculous!) scalability\n* How Kotlin enables you to do so with less code and more elegance\n*The presenter will code all examples live and in real time*. \n\nThis is not an abstract discussion, come to gain real, practical knowledge!\n\nResources:\nKotlinConf website: https://jb.gg/fyaze5\nKotlinConf on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlinconf\n\nKotlin website: https://jb.gg/pxrsn6\nKotlin blog: https://jb.gg/7uc7ow\nKotlin on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlin\n\n#KotlinConf19 #Kotlin #JetBrains\n\nAbout the Presenter:\nMark Heckler is a Pivotal Principal Technologist & Spring Developer Advocate, conference speaker, published author, & Java Champion focusing upon developing innovative production-ready software at velocity for the Cloud and IoT applications.
