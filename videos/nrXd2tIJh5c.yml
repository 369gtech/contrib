description: 'NoSQL, Big Data and Scale-out in general are leaving the hype plateau and start to become enterprise reality. This usally means no more ACID tranactions, but BASE transactions instead. When confronted with BASE, many developers just shrug and think "Okay, no more SQL but that''s basically it, isn''t it?". They are terribly wrong! BASE transactions do not guarantee data consistency at all times anymore, which is a property we became so used to in the ACID years that we barely think about it anymore. But if we continue to design and implement our applications as if there still were ACID transactions, system crashes and corrupt data will become your daily company. This session gives a quick introduction into the challenges of BASE transactions and explains how to design and implement a BASE-aware application using real code examples. Additionally we extract some concrete patterns in order to preserve the ideas in a concise way. Let''s get ready to survive in a BASE world!'
