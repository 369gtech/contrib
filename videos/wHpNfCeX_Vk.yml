description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM STO 19 http://bit.ly/2W2vgDC\n\nGet involved in Code Sync's next conference http://bit.ly/2Mcm4aS\n\n---\n\nMAKE A DISTRIBUTED TOOLBOX WITH RA\nby Karl Nilsson\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nCoordination \nFault-tolerance\nDistribution\n\nTALK LEVEL: Intermediate\n\nABSTRACT\nRa (https://github.com/rabbitmq/ra) is an implementation of the Raft consensus protocol by Team RabbitMQ. In RabbitMQ Ra is used to implement a consistent replicated queue but that isn't all that Ra can be used for. This talks will be a practical session on how to implement consistent distributed system essentials such as replicated a key-value stores, leader election processes, lock servers and other coordination services on top of the Ra library.\n\nRead the full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/karl-nilsson/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - KARL NILSSON\nKarl wrestles distributed rabbits for a living\n\nKarl comes from a .NET background (C# / F#) where he worked mostly on distributed systems. He is an avid proponent of functional programming. He now works for Pivotal on the RabbitMQ messaging broker.\n\nMore on Karl Nilsson: https://codesync.global/speaker/karl-nilsson/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM STO 19\nCode BEAM STO is powered by Code Sync.
