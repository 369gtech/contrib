You probably don't know him yet, but you already know his tools of the trade - HTML5 and JavaScript. What's so special about him? Well, if you're a front-end developer there's a huge chance you're already building Internets that can be used as Firefox OS apps with almost no hassle. If you're into HTML5 game development I've got some good news for you.\n\nLearn about Firefox OS mobile system, Firefox Marketplace and a concept of developing mobile HTML5 games easily and getting a bucket load of money out of it.\"\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
