title: 'Watch Me Build a Marketing Startup'
language: English
recordingDate: 1555949421
description: "I've built an app called VectorFunnel that automatically scores leads for marketing & sales teams! I used React for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, PostgreSQL for the database, and Tensorflow.js for scoring each lead in an excel spreadsheet. There are a host of other tools that I used like ClearBit's data API and various Javascript frameworks. If you have no idea what any of that is, that's ok I'll show you! In this video, I'll explain how I built the app so that you can understand how all these parts fit together. The learning goal here is to give you enough of an idea of how these tools work to be able to formulate a plan for your own marketing startup MVP (minimum viable product).
