description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2012\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nSadek Drobi - CTO of Zenexity\n\nABSTRACT\nPlay is a modern web application framework built on top of the JVM and features simplicity and high scalability on top of its web-friendly architecture. One of the major focuses of the Play framework is supporting Real-time web apps, which are apps that provide continuous bidirectional client/server communication using technologies like WebSockets, Server-sent events and Comet. Realtime Web opens a new horizon of possibilities and opportunities for web applications, and by avoiding traditional polling-based approaches, an app can use less resources, be more responsive, and provide a better user experience for a large variety of client browsers and devices. Combined with other components of Play's infrastructure such as the reactive programming model and the strong and performant foundation of the JVM, the end result is a straightforward and robust programming model which scales easily and provides support for a wide variety of applications. This talk will explore the capabilities present in a Real-time web app, and will offer insight into how Play framework applications are developed compared to other frameworks which you may already be working with.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
