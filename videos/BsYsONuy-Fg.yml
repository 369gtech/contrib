description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nKeynote: Cloud & Cloud Native Identity and Access Management: Challenges & Opportunities - Aradhna Chetal, TIAA; Greg Blana, Consultant; Nathanael Coffing & Craig Thomas, Leader C2 Labs\n\nWith the adoption of Cloud & Cloud Native technologies and workloads becoming more distributed, the challenge still remains in achieving zero trust. Organizations struggle to enforce rules and policies within today’s complex and heterogeneous multi-cloud hybrid IT environments. Gartner predicts that by 2023, 75% of cloud security failures will result from inadequate management of identities, access, and privileges. Externalizing access decisions/policies from application code, consistently enforcing access policies, leveraging attributes in the access decision making enables fine-grain authorization decisions and provides greater control over data security. In this session, we will discuss different challenges and solutions for Identity and access management in hybrid cloud native environments to achieve continuous identity assurance."
