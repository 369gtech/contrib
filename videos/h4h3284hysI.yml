title: 'DrupalCon Baltimore 2017: We have experimental modules, now what?'
recordingDate: 1493233520
description: "A critical part of how Drupal 8 allows tinkering and innovation is through experimental modules. While we shortened the release cycle of significant Drupal 8 improvements to twice a year, some things just need more time to be fully built and stable. This is what experimental modules in core enable, while allowing us to put the new improvements to a wider test. There are definitely upsides and downsides to this process and we will discuss these in detail:\n\nWhat kind of improvements are\_destined to be experimental modules?\nWhat about experimental installation profiles?\nWhere did the experimental module process help and fail us?\nDo we have too many or not enough experimental modules?\nHow do we ensure that experimental modules mature to stable soon enough?\nI will also try to get some key experimental module authors either as a panel or in the audience, as appropriate and as it is possible to fit with the schedule. To be confirmed."
