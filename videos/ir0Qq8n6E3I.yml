title: 'Lambda Jam 2015 - Marek Kolodziej - FP and Scala - The Killer Combo for Machine Learning'
recordingDate: 1445130031
description: "While FP and Scala have already become the mainstays of middleware, web and big data stacks (Akka, Play, Kafka, Spark), they tend not to have a big presence in the machine learning and NLP communities. For instance, the emerging deep learning toolkits are mostly Python-based (Pylearn2, Theano, etc.).\n\nPerformance seekers dissatisfied with slow scripting languages write typed Cython code, contorted C++ libraries bound to scripting language wrappers, or resort to random exotic solutions such as Lua (e.g. Torch deep learning library). Some even dispense with all abstraction and write incomprehensible CUDA kernels.\n\nThere has got to be a better way. As a machine learning engineer, I want to write strongly typed functional code. Math is declarative, has no place for side effects, and I don’t want to waste time running a simulation for hours, only to find that I made a typo in my Python script.\n\nUnbeknownst to most, Scala’s machine learning and NLP ecosystem is growing rapidly, from numeric processing (Spire, Breeze) to big data machine learning (MLLib, Mahout) to GPU-based text parsing (Puck), to general-purpose probabilistic programming (FACTORIE) and deep learning (Deeplearning4J).\n\nIn this talk, I’ll do a quick overview of Scala’s data science ecosystem, talk about FP-centric machine learning and NLP libraries, and cover some useful, reusable FP patterns (e.g. abstract algebra type classes). I’ll also demo the power of Scala by implementing a simple spelling corrector in about 20 lines of code, heavily relying on the standard library combinators.\n\nMarek is passionate about machine learning (especially deep learning) and natural language processing at scale using Spark. He loves functional programming and strongly typed languages, especially Scala. He received a PhD in Energy and Environmental Systems from Boston University and an MSc in Economics from the University of Illinois. Currently, he’s working on NLP at OCR problems.\n\nFor more on Lambda Jam, visit http://www.lambdajam.com"
