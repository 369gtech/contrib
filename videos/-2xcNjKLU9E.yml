description: "Deep Dive: Auth SIG - Mo Khan & Matt Rogers, Red Hat \n\nWe present a thorough walkthrough of the Kubernetes authentication and authorization codebase, where we will cover interface contracts and give specific examples of how they are implemented in Kubernetes. &nbsp;The audience will also be given a high level overview of the request processing pipeline. &nbsp;The generic nature of these interfaces will be explored along with a look into areas where Kubernetes has a strong opinion on the implementation specifics such as service accounts and the node authorizer. &nbsp;As a case study, the OpenShift auth stack will be discussed. &nbsp;OpenShiftâ€™s use of OAuth for authentication and role based access control for authorization will lead into discussions around token delegation, auditing, access controlled resource lists, etc. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MXvp"
