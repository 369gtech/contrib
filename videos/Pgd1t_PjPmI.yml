It provides optional, additive functionality on top of core Kubernetes. It tries to address the fragmented infrastructure layers in the current stack.  In this joint talk, Feng Min will go over the state of infrastructure today, and see how cluster API fit into the picture. Feng will also look at the structure of cluster api for things like Machine Set/Machine Deployment, and check out how they can help out the common cluster operation like upgrade. As a case study, Zhiguo Hong will talk how tencent cloud support get integrated, and how cluster-api can be applied to manage k8s cluster in tencent cloud. The audience will walk away with a clear understanding of cluster-api architecture, and how current cluster management can be transformed into cluster-api world. \n\nTo learn more click here:  https://sched.co/FuJg"
