description: "SnapCode is a new free IDE for education that helps students create animations, games, and apps by dragging puzzle pieces to create Java and JavaFX programs. It has the ease of use of other tools but creates real Java files with real syntax and APIs. It offers a stepping stone, not a crutch—as skills progress, there is nothing to unlearn and no reason to switch tools. Build an animated story or the next Minecraft—there is no limit. This session presents an approach to learning with a set of puzzle-based exercises in which the user draws from a box of instructions in the form of puzzle pieces to assemble a complete program to complete a task. Completing puzzles leads to certifications that set students on a path to a new career.\n\n\nAuthor:\nJeff Martin\nJeff Martin's career started with the education of a lifetime working for Steve Jobs at NeXT (and later Apple) through the 1990s. There he learned fundamental philosophies of elegant UI design, flexible and simple API design, proper tooling, agile development, and important principles of object-oriented and reusable code.\n\nHis recent background is as founder and steward of a small engineering-focused software company, ReportMill Software. Responsibilities include designing, implementing, testing, deploying, documenting, supporting, training, marketing and selling ReportMill's several developer tool products: the ReportMill Java application reporting system, Ribs, an interface builder for Swing, JFXBuilder, the first JavaFX UI Builder and SnapCode, an IDE and RAD tool for education and the enterprise.\nView more trainings by Jeff Martin at https://www.parleys.com/author/jeff-martin-1\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
