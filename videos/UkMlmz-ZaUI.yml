title: 'Moving forward to Groovy 3.0'
recordingDate: 1543667189
description: 'The Java platform has been moving forward with both VM and grammar features unavailable in Groovy.Although Groovy is more expressive than what Java is working to achieve, that gap should be closed for Groovy to stay relevant, as many popular libraries target the new Java features.After Java 8, the Groovy''s welcoming "copy-and-paste" backwards compatibility is reduced quite a lot, due to new language syntax and features. Also lambdas are faster than closures, and Groovy''s parser is old and finicky.With Java 9, a module system was introduced, and is currently incompatible with Groovy, since it introduces severe restrictions on how code can be packaged.Java 10 adds the reserved type name "var" which muddies the water even more.This talk gives a beta-preview of Groovy 3.0, and discusses what lambdas, the new parser, new MOP and JPMS module support will mean for Groovy, and features an interview with Daniel Sun, a relatively new Groovy committer working on 3.0 features.'
