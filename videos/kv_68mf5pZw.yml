title: 'Fireside Chat #15 - Should teams be kept the same or be changed according to business needs?'
language: English
recordingDate: 1633625080
description: "In this episode, our co-founders Sandro Mancuso, Mashooq Badar, and Spain Managing Director José E. Rodríguez Huerta discuss how people, teams and business should be aligned. Should we keep teams immutable but give them different missions over time? Should we keep them aligned to a business domain? Or should we create and recreate teams to satisfy evolving business needs? Another very insightful conversation and loads of food for thought. \n\nIf you would like us to discuss a topic, please let us know in the comments and we will do our best to address it in a future episode. Any topics around Agile, Software Craftsmanship, Extreme Programming, technical practices, thought leadership, architecture, management, team dynamics, or anything related to technology or software projects are welcome. \n\nThe idea of the Fireside chat series is to record many informal conversations we normally have outside working hours. Topics are normally decided just before we start recording. Our objective is to have spontaneous conversations instead of something more structured or scripted. \n\nFor more information about Codurance, please visit our website: https://codurance.com/."
