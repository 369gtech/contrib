description: "Historically, creating web applications that need bidirectional communication between a client and a server (e.g., instant messaging & gaming applications) has required an abuse of HTTP to poll the server for updates while sending upstream notifications as distinct HTTP calls.\n\nHTML5 specification includes the WebSockets (WS) protocol, I will deep dive into the specification by introducing the Websocket protocol, API and working mechanism, alongside intro to the most widely used data exchange schema between front and back end, the JSON API.\n\nIn addition, there is a brief comparison of traditional HTTP & WS, followed by covering of how WebSockets works. You will see how using WS removes the overhead of heavy HTTP request and response headers with real case study. Finally, we will review the code of the Web app build on GlassFish 4 app server."
