title: 'MLconf Online 2020: Deep Learning Battle: TensorFlow 2 vs. PyTorch by Jon Krohn'
language: English
recordingDate: 1606757686
description: 'This talk begins with a survey of the primary families of Deep Learning approaches: Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, Generative Adversarial Networks, and Deep Reinforcement Learning. Via interactive demos, the meat of the talk will appraise the two leading Deep Learning libraries: TensorFlow and PyTorch. With respect to both model development and production deployment, the strengths and weaknesses of the two libraries will be covered -- with a particular focus on TensorFlow 2 release that formally integrates the easy-to-use, high-level Keras API into the library.'
