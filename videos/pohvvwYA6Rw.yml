title: 'GeeCON 2018: Charlie Gracie - Deep dive into the Eclipse OpenJ9 GC technologies'
language: English
recordingDate: 1532330828
description: 'Eclipse OpenJ9 is a Java Virtual Machine for OpenJDK that''s optimized for small footprint, fast start-up, and high throughput. To help achieve these goals OpenJ9 provides 4 different GC policies that you may not know about. Each of these policies has its strengths and weaknesses so choosing the right one for your application can make a noticeable difference in performance and responsiveness. For this talk I will provide a deep dive into these technologies, the domains where they work best and discuss performance throughput versus responsiveness. https://github.com/eclipse/openj9 https://github.com/eclipse/omr https://adoptopenjdk.net/ My target audience would be ''everyday users'' but I believe both beginners and experts would also be able to take away valuable information. While this talk will use OpenJ9 as the example VM most of the information will be applicable to all JVMs.'
