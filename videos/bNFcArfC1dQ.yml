title: 'Rust in Python: Fixing Regular Expressions'
language: English
recordingDate: 1531152005
description: "Dive into the limits of Python regular expressions including examples! Detour reminder of Regular Expressions including those features not often seen like negative lookahead. Learn from the 1970â€™s how deterministic finite automaton can be used to solve a subset of the regular expression performance problem.\n\nA drop-in fix of API-compatible solution for integrating the Rust regex crate into Python. Not stopping at just a solution the guts of building a Rust program for Python is covered. First, a quick introduction to Rust the programming language. Then building the requisite Rust binaries, to installing a binary package via pip, to using CFFI to call them from Python.\n\nEVENT:\n\nIndyPy 2017\n\nSPEAKERS:\n\nDavid Blewett and Andrew Roden\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqGGUsVwtZk"
