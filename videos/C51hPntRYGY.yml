description: "Speaker:  Laura Moore, Rightbox\nDid you know that Spring did not invent many of the core concepts of Spring? No indeed, the framework evolved to solve common software design and implementation problems, allowing you the developer to solve for them in a standard, flexible way. In this talk we will take a look a several of the core features, and walk through the common software problems that are being addressed. If you are new to Spring and even Java you will have new insight into how to choose your features and where to google for answers."
