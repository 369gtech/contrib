This case study discusses how one such program was successfully moved toward DevOps using value stream analysis and logic. Lessons learned and pitfalls will be discussed as well as metrics used to measure successes. Topics tackled will not only include a discussion of how CI/CD was implemented but how security and compliance was integrated into the process.\n\nDOES16 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
