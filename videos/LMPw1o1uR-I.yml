description: "Slides and more info: http://www.codemesh.io/codemesh2015/ben-stopford\n\nWe use a host of tricks these days for handling data at scale. Disk structures are tuned to specific workloads. Streams are used to create continuous pipelines of processing. Hardware offers incredible diversity in terms of latency and throughput.\n\nThe tools available: Cassandra, Postgres, Hadoop, Kafka, Hazelcast, Storm etc all come with tradeoffs unique to themselves. We’ll look at these as individual elements. We’ll also look at compositions that leverage these individual sweet spots to create more powerful, holistic platforms.\n\nTalk objectives:\n\n- To gain a better understanding of how data technology works and options you have for scaling out solutions as they grow, particularly for common Finance use cases. \n\nTarget audience:\n\n- Developers interested in how data technology works and how larger data problems may be solved.\n\nAbout Ben\n\nBen is a specialist in data tech, HPC and cluster computing. His last big project involved designing and building a central data platform for a large investment bank. He's worked in Finance, at Thoughtworks and is currently at Confluent."
