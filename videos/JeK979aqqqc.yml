description: "Neal Ford breaks down the concepts behind functional programming in this video from JaxConf 2012. \n\nIn this video, Neal states that picking up concepts of functional programming is made much harder when the developer is also trying to learn a new language, like Scala or Clojure, at the same time. With that in mind, Neal will focus on relating functional concepts to Java world.\n\n** More videos on open source development at http://marakana.com/s/"
