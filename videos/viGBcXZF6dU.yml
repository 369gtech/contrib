title: 'Azure cloud for the web frontend developers - Maxim Salnikov - NDC Oslo 2020'

description: "It’s impossible to reason about modern web application without mentioning its front-end part – extensive, feature-rich, performant, sometimes with quite sophisticated structure and build process, but after all not requiring server-side code to construct it in the runtime, i.e. static. In the Azure cloud, we now have a special service for this kind of apps (including both classic SPAs and statically generated ones), empowering developers to focus on the business logic rather than the infrastructure that builds and hosts them.\n\nIn my technical demo, let's go through the full development flow: we scaffold a web front-end app, push it to the GitHub, set up Azure Static Web App service, enjoy the fully automatic build, and deploy to global high-availability hosting - all in a few minutes!"
