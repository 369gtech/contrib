title: 'Awesome Node.js microservices in the cloud for (almost) free - Gojko Adzic'
recordingDate: 1473406683
description: "The new generation of cloud services significantly lowers the bar for deploying small, focused microservices to the cloud. AWS Lambda and API Gateway offer scalability on demand, zero operations overhead and almost free execution, priced per use, so they are a very compelling way to run server-side code. However, setting things up for Javascript is often a challenge.\nGojko will show you tips, tricks and examples on how to get started with Node.js running inside AWS Lambda, avoid the common pitfalls, and maintain the services hassle-free. This is a mix of an experience report and a coding demo."
