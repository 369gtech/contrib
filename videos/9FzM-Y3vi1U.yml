description: "Rise of the Machines: Removing the Human-in-the-Loop\n\nViral Gupta and Yunbo Ouyang, LinkedIn\n\nMost large-scale online recommender systems like notifications recommendation, newsfeed ranking, people recommendations, job recommendations, etc. often have multiple utilities or metrics that need to be simultaneously optimized. The machine learning models that are trained to optimize a single utility are combined together through parameters to generate the final ranking function. These combination parameters drive business metrics. Finding the right choice of the parameters is often done through online A/B experimentation, which can be incredibly complex and time-consuming, especially considering the non-linear effects of these parameters on the metrics of interest. In this talk we will present how we build generic solution to solve the problem at scale.\n\nView the full OpML '20 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/opml20/program"
