description: "Content Security Policy (CSP) is a set of rules to help mitigate and prevent attacks such as Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection. On some platforms like Chrome Apps and Cordova it's a *requirement* that your code comply with CSP, so what does that mean if you're building a Polymer app? Today on the show we'll look at how to use a little tool called Crisper to make sure your site is protected by CSP.\n\nDemo Source\nhttps://goo.gl/cJBR4H\n\nIntroduction to CSP\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/d...\n\nCrisper\nhttps://github.com/PolymerLabs/crisper\n\ngulp-crisper\nhttps://goo.gl/uGaA7Y\n\nPolymer Starter Kit\nhttps://goo.gl/djOKPW\n\nPolycasts playlist: https://goo.gl/r5fsMq \nPolymer Slack: http://bit.ly/polymerslack\n \n\nSubscribe to the Chrome Developers channel: https://goo.gl/OUF4e2"
