description: "Dave Thomas was one of the creators of the Agile Manifesto. A year ago, he told us that Agile is Dead. How could this be? Why had he deserted us? And what are we to do?\n\nIt turns out that while the “Agile” industry is busy debasing the meaning of the word, the underlying values are still strong. In this talk, Dave will draw a distinction, and show us how to reclaim agility for ourselves.\n\nAs usual, he’ll probably end up making some friends, and making some enemies. Which will you be?\n\nDave Thomas is a cornerstone of the Ruby community, and is personally responsible for many of its innovative directions and initiatives. Dave is a programmer, and now he is an accidental publisher. He wrote The Pragmatic Programmer with Andy Hunt at the end of the ’90s, and that experience opened a new world for them. They discovered a love of writing that complemented their love of learning new things. Dave is one of the authors of the Agile Manifesto, and he is probably responsible for bringing Ruby to attention of Western developers with the book Programming Ruby. He was one of the first adopters of Rails, and helped spread the word with the book Agile Web Development with Rails. He enjoys speaking at conferences, running public and private training. But most of all, he loves coding.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
