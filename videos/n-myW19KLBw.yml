title: 'YOW! West 2014 - Angular - Say Goodbye to Javascript Soup - Graeme Foster'
recordingDate: 1422352123
description: "Ever tried to write complex front-end code using Javascript and JQuery? Ever inherited Javascript soup? So many languages now use Html for their client UI - Ruby, Php, .Net, Java to mention a few. We can use Cordova to package Html applications for native app-store delivery. Yet so many end up with unmaintainable piles of javascript.\n\nIn this session I'm going to show you how you can use Angular to tame your front-end code. Starting with a browser, a text-editor, and a simple piece of Html, we'll use it to create a rich yet simple controller. We'll write some Jasmine tests to confirm what's going on and mock out some Http calls along the way.\n\nBy the end of the talk you'll have an understanding of Angular controllers, directives, modules, resources and factories, and how to test them all using Jasmine."
