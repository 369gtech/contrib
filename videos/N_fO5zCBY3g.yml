description: 'JSR-377, the Desktop|Embedded Application API JSR has as a goal to standardize common behavior shared by many desktop applications. This behavior can also be applied to the emerging Java Embedded and Internet-of-Things applications. Because the JSR targets multiple toolkits (Swing, JavaFX, SWT and more) it''s even possible to build applications targeting the mobile space (JavaFX on mobile). There are a good number of framework and platforms that deliver these features in their own way. In this talk we''ll discuss the current state of this JSR and explore its features.'
