recordingDate: 1535399197
description: "If you’re serious about UX, then it’s time to bust out some games. Seriously. Nearly everything we should know about crafting an experience can be learned (and learned better) by studying game design.\n\nIn this workshop, speaker Stephen P. Anderson will expose you to the process of designing a board game, with a special focus on lessons and tools we, as UX designers, can bring back to our daily processes. Some of the ideas may be familiar: Iterative testing and prototypes. Starting with a desired experience. Designing for emotions. Other ideas may be less familiar: Modeling complex systems. Designing for emergent behaviors. Whatever the case, you’ll see your perspective changed as you experience these concepts through a game design lens.\n\nThis fast-paced workshop will challenge you to design a game, experiencing first-hand the mindset needed to level up your UX work.\n\nTHROUGH A SERIES OF HANDS-ON ACTIVITIES, ATTENDEES WILL LEARN PRACTICAL WAYS TO:\nDefine a core experience that drives every product decision\nDesign emotionally engaging experiences based on core needs and motivations\nWork quickly and iteratively to ship a complete-enough system (that can then be iterated upon)\nSeparate bad friction (usability issues) from good friction (inherent learning challenges)\nSpot and articulate gaps in our processes that handicap great experiences\nIf we can look our our own profession through the lens of game design, we’ll see plenty of glaring opportunities for improvement, and a few tricks we might pick up, as well.\n- Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/amuse\n\nSave the date!
