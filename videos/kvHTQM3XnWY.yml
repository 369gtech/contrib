title: 'A Developer’s Introduction to Containers'
language: English
recordingDate: 1632327273
description: "Containers are becoming the preferred method for deploying applications, but will they work for you—and should they even be used? Several open source technologies are maturing around containers, including Docker Engine, Kubernetes, Swarm, and OpenShift.\n \n There are significant benefits to working with containers. Some of the reasons to choose containerization include resource management, security, and portability. Despite the benefits, the technology and the ecosystem around them is overwhelming. This talk aims to demystify some of this complexity.\n \n Join us for a look under the hood at containers and orchestration. Whether you're new to containers or a more seasoned user, you're invited. Come gain a better understanding of how and when to use these tools.\n\nNigel Brown, Senior Open Source Community Manager at VMware"
