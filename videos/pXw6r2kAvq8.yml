description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2019 by Zsolt Kocsi, Badoo.\n\nMore info: http://androidmakers.fr/schedule/?sessionId=DZK-4920\n\nAt Badoo, we have a long history when it comes to Android development. Since the beginning, the product has experienced huge growth, and our codebase and our team have grown with it. We now have over 400 million registrations, as well as several new apps to support. Over the years we’ve tried MVP, Clean architecture, MVI, and many more approaches, some of them brewed in-house. In this talk we’ll go on an architectural journey and discuss some of the major problems we needed to find solutions for in the last few years, before ending on what is ahead of us.\n\nAlex Karp Production"
