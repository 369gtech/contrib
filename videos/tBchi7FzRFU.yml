description: "Thanks to our Community Sponsors: Honeycomb.io and CircleCI.com\n\nSpeakers: Heidi Waterhouse (Developer Advocate, LaunchDarkly), Aniela Crisan (Engineering Director, OLX Group), Antonio Verardi (Software Engineer, Yelp), Whitney O'Banner (Software Engineering Manager, Medium).\n\nWhen they work well, OKRs have the potential to be a powerful tool that can clarify vision at all levels of the business, all while providing autonomy for smaller functions to set their own goals and objectives.\n\nSo why do so many OKRs feel onerous, or seem to not quite measure what they’re intending to do so?\n\nIn this panel, we’ll take a look at how to design OKRs that do what they’re supposed to do and how you can avoid the pitfalls that lead them to go astray."
