description: "Dropping consecutive repeats from a list, and some construction of possibly unorthodox predicates.\n*IMPORTANT*: At first I was claiming that loop-in-loop functions are \"exponential\" (2^n) but later in the video I realize that they are \"quadratic\" (n^2) which means \"parabola\" curves and *not* exponential curves. Apologies for my nonsense. I had not planned to say so much about time complexity but could not stop myself and then it was too late :) \n\n*IMPORTANT 2:* Sorry for hiding some of the code using my face ? I'll find a technical solution for this and use it in every future video from now on so that I never make this mistake again!\n\nExploring all the functions of the JavaScript library Ramda JS and learning functional programming along the way.\n\n??
