The session will cover the basic use cases and features of the framework, with a candid discussion of the challenges, decisions, influences, and even missteps encountered in the process of building a mobile web framework as our definition of \"mobile\" continues to evolve.\n\nAbout Scott: https://scottjehl.com\nAbout Mobilism: https://mobilism.nl"
