title: 'Getting Started with Unity and AR/VR for the .NET Developer - Davide Zordan'
language: English
recordingDate: 1623665610
description: "We all see the cool demos of how augmented and virtual reality are going to be the future of our interaction with devices, but it often feels like there’s a significant barrier to getting started in building these types of apps.\n\nThis session is here to help. If you’ve ever thought about developing for Oculus Rift S, HTC VIVE or the Windows Mixed Reality headsets, but haven’t known where to start, this is the session for you.\n\nAt NDC London, I will present what I learned building a small game, set in a mysterious dungeon using Unity and the SteamVR plugin. We'll explore how to import assets from the Unity store, how to implement locomotion techniques and interactions using the motion/touch controllers, including some tips for optimising performance and avoid motion sickness.\n\nCome along, there’ll be .NET code, demos and we’ll have some fun looking at how you can get started on your first VR/AR project."
