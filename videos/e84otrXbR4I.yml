title: 'JSON and SODA with the Autonomous JSON Database - Europe, Middle East, Africa'

description: "JSON and SODA with the Autonomous JSON Database\n\nSchema-flexibility is a big reason why JSON makes a lot of sense for application development. In the initial phase especially, an application is quite dynamic, new fields are needed, interfaces get changed, etc. Maintaining a relational schema is hard if application changes often need a change in the underlying tables and existing data needs to be modified to fit into the new schema. JSON makes this much easier as new documents may look different than your old ones.\n\nIn this lab, you will explore:\n\n- How to start an Oracle Autonomous (JSON) Database\n- Fundamentals on the JSON data model and when to use it\n- How to store, query and process JSON document in collections using the   SODA API\n- How to use SQL to query, generate and process JSON data\n- How to convert JSON data to the relational model (e.g., for analytics or reporting)\n- How to generate JSON data from relational sources (e.g., to serve a microservice)\n- How to update JSON data\n\n#JSON #Autonomous"
