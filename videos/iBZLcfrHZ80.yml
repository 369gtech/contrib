title: 'Hands-on Stateful Serverless Applications with Kubernetes and Stateful Functions'
recordingDate: 1603796409
description: 'Stateful Functions (https://statefun.io/) is a framework that makes it simple to build consistent stateful serverless applications. StateFun is designed to work with popular event-driven FaaS platforms like AWS Lambda, KNative, etc., and provides out-of-the-box consistent state and reliable messaging to FaaS platforms, in a way that preserves the serverless experience and elasticity of these platforms. Stateful Functions is not a library that proxies state access to a database, but an independent event-driven stack replacing the traditional database. This video takes you step-by-step through building and deploying a Stateful Functions application that tracks user events and runs a stateful ML classifier.'
