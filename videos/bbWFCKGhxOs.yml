recordingDate: 1451947892
description: "Tapabrata Pal, Product Manager, Capital One\n\nCapital One, one of the largest credit card companies and the largest digital bank in the US, is also a 20-year-old technology company. A couple of decades ago, Capital One disrupted the credit card industry using “Big Data” analytics to customize credit offers before the term “Big Data” was coined.\n\nOur current focus is bringing humanity and simplicity to banking, and we are poised to disrupt the industry through technological innovations. To do this, we are embracing modern technology such as public cloud and open source, and principles such as Agile and DevOps, and recruiting and fostering the best technical talent in the industry.\n\nWe started this journey about four years ago. Today we practice Agile, DevOps and Lean principles across the whole enterprise. Insourcing of technical talent rather than depending on vendor-provided solutions is what helped us rapidly transform and get back to our roots as a technology company. We have internal communities of practice for all latest technology areas ­ DevOps, Cloud, Open Source, Container, Programming Languages, etc., and we recently had our first internal Software Engineering Conference with 1200+ participants.\n\nWe are creating our own solutions based on a deep understanding of what our customers value.\n\nWe love open source. We follow “open source first” policy across our entire software stack. We are also in the process of open sourcing many of our internal tools, which allows us to increase quality and speed to market. We are building cloud native digital solutions using microservices and deploying them on the public cloud. Through it all, we have developed a culture of innovation, openness, and creativity while living up to our startup mindset.\n\nIn this presentation, I will share some background on this journey and some of our learning along the way."
