title: 'Webinar: Deploying Kubernetes to bare metal using cluster API'
language: English
recordingDate: 1603316134
description: "Deploying Kubernetes to bare metal hardware in your data center has a number of advantages, including increased security, performance, data adjacency, and flexibility. But bare metal deployments have disadvantages compared to the cloud or virtual environments. A wide variety of hardware, storage, and network configurations increase risk, and inadequate tooling means testing and “day 2” operations on bare metal can be slow and hard to automate.\n\nA collection of new open-source tools from Talos Systems based on the Cluster API project aims to solve these problems, and bring the flexibility of cloud-style machine types (m1.small, etc), immutable infrastructure, and fully-automated deployment tools to bare metal environments. We will describe the architecture of these new tools, show a demo of a Kubernetes deployment and a subsequent OS upgrade, and describe our future plans for these tools.\n\nPresenter:\nSeán McCord, Principal Senior Software Engineer @Talos Systems, Inc."
