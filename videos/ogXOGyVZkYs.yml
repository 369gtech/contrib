description: "If you're attending this conference, you care about building better software - you're willing to challenge the way that things are done and to try new ways of working.\n\nBut do you do the same for your career? This talk is not about software, it's all about you and how to be valuable and employable. It's about how to feel in control of your options and confident about navigating the new ways of working."
