title: 'YOW! 2019 - Michael Brunton Spall - Does agile make us less secure?'
recordingDate: 1581537603
description: "Organisations adopting agile practices tend to throw out the old practices of requirements gathering, up front system design and careful analysis in favour of writing code just in time and pushing into production multiple times per day. Doesnâ€™t this make us far less secure? Michael will provide a whirlwind tour of real world security today and use that to address this question and talk about the tension between agile and security - and offer ways that you can resolve this tension.\n\nMichael Brunton-Spall is an independent Cybersecurity consultant, working for the UK Government.  Michael is a former Deputy Director with the Cabinet Office, where he headed up Technology and Operations for the Government Digital Service as well as being head of Cybersecurity.  Michael has worked in technology for over 15 years, in topics as varied as embedded device development, games console programming, low latency trading and web publishing. Michael coauthored the book on Agile Application Security and has delivered popular conference talks on various topics ranging from Microservices to Agile Security.\n\nFor more on YOW!
