recordingDate: 1618856045
description: "In this Session, we share how you can build an intelligent User Interface (UI) at any scale by combining Angular and TensorFlow.js. First we explore how you can start with machine learning declaratively in your Angular templates in just a few minutes. Then you learn how to build an ML model with data from Google Analytics to better predict a user’s browsing patterns. Finally, we show a powerful TensorFlow Extended (TFX) based training pipeline to automate the training and deployment process.\n\nRegister for I/O → https://goo.gle/2OTj06K\n\nSpeakers: Minko Gechev, David Zats\n\nWatch more:\nChrome Developers at Google I/O 2021 Playlist → https://goo.gle/io21-ChromeDevs\nAll Google I/O 2021 Technical Sessions → https://goo.gle/io21-technicalsessions\nAll Google I/O 2021 Sessions → https://goo.gle/io21-allsessions\n\nSubscribe to Google Chrome Developers → https://goo.gle/ChromeDevs​ \n\n#GoogleIO"
