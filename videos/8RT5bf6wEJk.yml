description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nAn Overview on SLSA - Tom Hennen, Google & Joshua Lock, VMware\n\nSLSA – Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts – introduces a comprehensive methodology to prevent tampering with the software supply chain.  To illustrate the impact of SLSA, we follow a few gremlins as they try to introduce malicious code into a container image used by thousands of projects.  At each step of the supply chain we show how SLSA controls raise the cost of attack, preventing the gremlins from causing any harm."
