description: "The talk from .NET Fest conference in Kyiv, Ukraine.\nPresentation: http://bit.ly/349gbAu\nFb: https://www.facebook.com/dotNETFest/\nWebsite: http://dotnetfest.com/\n\n\nIn these days, automation is the key to reduce the effort in governing complex system. Also, it reduces mistakes of manual, repetetive, operations. Despite the standardization of common approaches using text-based Infrastructure-as-code definitions, as YAML or JSON, I will suggest to write your provisioning templates using C# and .NET, against Microsoft Azure.\nIn this demo-only session, we'll see the Azure Fluent Management Libraries in action to create a multi-tenant environment with strong-typed objects and compile-type-safe provisioning code."
