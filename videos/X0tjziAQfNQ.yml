description: "Microservices are just a bunch hip new framework plus some AngularJS frontend or React, right?\nSo, if you want to make sure that you absolutely and definitely fail at your Microservice project, then watch this talk and learn how.\n\nUsing real world experience from multiple green field and brown field projects, I can show you:\n- how to ignore the mandatory organizational impact\n- how to focus on the code only without any regard towards ops and testing\n- continuous deployment is for losers. Real projects use their meat cloud for delivery\n- jumping onto every new and untested framework is a must\n- EventSourcing and CQRS are both free lunches. So, you can add complexity without any real need\n- ...and more\n\nIf you mind my tips, then surely you will fail at Microservices and your boss will never again try to move away from your beloved vintage monolith.\n\nDavid Schmitz\nPricinpal architect at Senacor Technologies with a history of + 13 years of working in various projects using a bunch of different stacks and environments.\n\nCurrent focus is on migrating architectures and organizations, such that our customers can cope with the challenges of the digital age."
