title: 'YOW! Data 2017 Christopher Biggs - From Little Things, Big Data Grow - IoT at Scale'
recordingDate: 1508209200
description: "The Internet of Things (IoT) is really about the ubiquity of data, the possibility of humans extending their awareness and reach globally, or further.\nIoT frees us from the tedium of physically monitoring or maintaining remote systems, but to be effective we must be able to rely on data being accessible but comprehensible. \n\nThis presentation covers three main areas of an IoT big data strategy\nThe Air Gap - options (from obvious to inventive) for connecting wireless devices to the internet\nTributaries - designing a scalable architecture for amalgamating IoT data flows into your data lake. Covers recommended API and message-bus architectures.\nManagement and visualisation - how to characterise and address IoT devices in ways that scale to continental populations. I will show some examples of large scale installations to which I've contributed and how to cope with information overload.\n\nChristopher Biggs has been into Open Systems since the early 90s and was there at the birth of Linux and 386BSD. His interest in electronics and connected devices goes back even further. He has worked as a developer, System Architect and Engineering Manager. He was founding Vice President of HUMBUG, the Brisbane open systems user group, and built and managed a diverse, inclusive team of over 60 developers at a leading Brisbane IT company. He has presented at conferences and user groups around Australia, and convened a weekly technology lecture series for the entire technology department at a previous workplace.\n\nChristopher is the principal of Accelerando Consulting, a boutique  consultancy specialising in IoT and Cloud Data. In his spare time he builds and blogs robots and adds to the growing Internet of Things.\n\nFor more information on YOW! Data Conference, visit\nhttp://data.yowconference.com.au"
