description: 'It is the syntax that most of us observe when introduced to a language. However, we ought to move quickly beyond that to leverage its powers. The real strength comes from its styles and idioms. Learning a different style does not simply change how we write code, it fundamentally changes how we think and how we solve problems. In this keynote, award winning author and mentor, Dr. Venkat Subramaniam will explore the idioms and style of prominent JVM languages, and help refactor your language portfolio.'
