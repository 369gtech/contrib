recordingDate: 1550058005
description: "Teams are different, projects are different, problems are different. Why are we still trying to squeeze teamwork into department processes, adding bureaucracy, and having organizational layers that makes it harder and much slower to get work done?\n\nJoin Sven Peters, former lead evangelist at Atlassian now K15t, as he talks about how to utilize a playbook for more team autonomy. No end-to-end process, no strict development rules, just some guidelines. Youll learn tons of plays like goal setting with OKRs, decision making with DACIs, team improvements with health monitors, finding risks with premortems, and many more. The playbook will give teams the freedom to pick what works in their environment."
