description: "Google Tech Talk\nJune 6, 2015\n(click \"show more\" for more information)\nPresented by Alex Crichton\n\nABSTRACT\n\nRust is an exciting new programming language that combines fine-grained control over memory layout and allocation patterns with memory and thread safety. It reached 1.0 in May and is rapidly gaining acceptance in projects including Servo (Mozilla's next generation parallel layout engine), a block store being developed by Dropbox, and numerous startups. Its features include zero-cost abstractions, move semantics, guaranteed memory safety, threads without data races, trait-based generics, pattern matching, type inference, minimal runtime, and efficient C bindings. Alex Crichton will present an introduction to the Rust programming language, explain how it can be used to build performant, reliable systems, and answer your questions.\n\nSpeaker Info:\n\nAlex Crichton About the speaker: Alex Crichton is a member of the Rust core team working at Mozilla Research. He focuses on the standard library, Cargo, crates.io, and Rust's tooling and infrastructure experience. He's been at Mozilla for almost two years and graduated from Carnegie Mellon in 2013 with a BS in both Computer Science and Electrical and Computer Engineering."
