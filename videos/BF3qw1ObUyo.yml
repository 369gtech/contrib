description: "Bridge to NewThingia: How to answer \"why will yours succeed, when X, Y, and Z have failed?\"\n\nGreat new ideas are common, and their developers and users want them to succeed. So why do the large majority fail to ever achieve wide adoption? For example, thousands of genuinely interesting programming languages have been invented, but few ever achieved widespread or long-lasting use. This talk considers examples and identifies some basic (but frequently-violated and hard-to-make-retroactive) strategic success predictors, that you can use to evaluate someone elseâ€™s new idea and to \"design for success\" in your own new project or language\n-------\n\nHerb is an author, chair of the ISO C++ standardization committee, and a programming languages architect at Microsoft.\n\n-------\n\nC++ on Sea is an annual c++ and coding conference, usually held in Folkestone, Kent in the UK. The 2020 conference was moved to a virtual event due to social distancing requirements.\n\nProduced and Edited by Digital Medium Ltd: https://events.digital-medium.co.uk\nEnquiries: events@digital-medium.co.uk"
