description: "Harmful GOTOs, Premature Optimizations and Programming Myths are The Root of All Evil - Alvaro Videla\n\nSlides and more info: http://www.codemesh.io/codemesh2015/alvaro-videla\n\nOver the years our industry has accumulated folklore that shapes what we are as an industry. We repeat maxims like \"Premature optimisation is the root of all evil\" but perhaps ignoring the context on which that sentence was said. This ignorance has lead us to creating myths that sometimes do more harm than good.\n\nIn this talk I will review some of those myths, see their origin and at the same time make a historical review of what was going on in our industry in the '70s, when those myths appeared.\n\nAs the old saying goes: _Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it_\n\nTalk objectives:\n\n- Promote a culture of reading more books, academic papers and related material that refers to the history of our field and programming in general.\n\nTalk audience:\n\n- From beginners to experts. No special knowledge is required to attend the talk.\n\nAbout Alvaro\n\nAlvaro Videla works as Core Developer for RabbitMQ. Before moving to Europe he used to work in Shanghai where he helped building one of Germany biggest dating websites. He co-authored the book \"RabbitMQ in Action\" for Manning Publishing. Some of his open source projects can be found here: http://github.com/videlalvaro. Apart from code related stuff he likes traveling with his wife, listening/playing music and reading books."
