title: 'Eloy Durán - Integrating React Native into an existing native codebase'
recordingDate: 1536920871
description: "You’ve got an existing application and have come to the exciting conclusion that you want to adopt React Native. Rather than rewriting your full application at once, you may want to introduce it in an iterative fashion and without impeding progress for developers that are continuing to work on the existing codebase in the interim. But where and how to start? This talk will focus on _why_ at Artsy we came to the conclusion to use React Native and provide practical examples on _how_ we integrated it into our existing Objective-C/Swift codebase.\n\nThis talk was presented at React Native EU 2017, September 6-7, Wroclaw, Poland."
