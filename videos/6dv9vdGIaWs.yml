description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nDiscussion & Comments: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2019\n—\nDo your C++ applications take longer to compiler than you would like? Do you ever instantiate a template with different arguments, not because you necessarily need all of the different types, but because you will not know until the program runs which of the types are needed? This presentation will describe how C++ can be enhanced with programmer-controller just-in-time (JIT) compilation, discuss different ways that the language can be extended to support this capability, and how JIT compilation can provide faster compile times along with increased performance. I'll describe ClangJIT, an enhancement to Clang implementing JIT-compilation extensions, and show some application performance data.\n\nJIT-compilation technology has been around for a long time, and is widely used in many different programming languages. Can we leverage JIT compilation in C++ consistent with C++'s philosophical underpinnings while addressing major challenges with C++ programming today? Come and find out!\n— \nHal Finkel\nArgonne National Laboratory\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
