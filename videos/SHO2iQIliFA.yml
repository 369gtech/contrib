title: 'Finding Slow PL/SQL: Use the Profilers!'
language: English
recordingDate: 1591140859
description: "Join Steven Feuerstein and Chris Saxon as we hear from our special guest, Shashank Barki, on his experience using PL/SQL profilers (DBMS_PROFILER and DBMS_HPROF) to identify bottlenecks in PL/SQL code.\n\nShashank is a Senior Principal Data Engineer at Manhattan Associates. He has 13 years experience as a developer, cloud architect and data analyst. In each of his jobs, he has promoted the use of PL/SQL to improve the performance, security and maintainability of their applications.\n\nDBMS_PROFILER is the name of the package that provides an API to the profiler that computes the time that your PL/SQL program spends at each line, in each subprogram. Saves runtime statistics in database tables, which you can then query.\n\nDBMS_HPROF is the hierarchical profiler; this utility reports the dynamic execution program profile of your PL/SQL program, organized by subprogram invocations. It accounts for SQL and PL/SQL execution times separately. Requiring no special source or compile-time preparation, it generates reports in HTML. You can also store profiler data and results in relational format in database tables for custom report generation (such as third-party tools offer).\n\nAskTOM Office Hours offers free, monthly training and tips on how to make the most of Oracle Database, from Oracle product managers, developers and evangelists.\n\nhttps://asktom.oracle.com/ \n\nOracle Developers portal: https://developer.oracle.com/\nSign up for an Oracle Cloud trial: https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/"
