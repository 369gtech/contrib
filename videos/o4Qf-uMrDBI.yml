description: "by Roman Kennke\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/H.1302/shenandoah.webm\n\nShenandoah GC landed in JDK12 about a year ago, giving OpenJDK\nanother low-pause garbage collector. It has undergone substantial\nchanges since then. Specifically we have a new barrier scheme, and have\neliminated the extra forwarding pointer word per object, thus\nsubstantially reducing memory footprint. After giving a general\nintroduction to OpenJDK GC landscape and Shenandoah GC, this talk\nfocuses on those recent changes in Shenandoah and what's in it for you.\n\nRoom: H.1302 (Depage)\nScheduled start: 2020-02-01 12:35:00"
