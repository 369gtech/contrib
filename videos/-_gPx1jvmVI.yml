description: "Second Q&A video :) Feel free to skip if you don't care :).\n\nThis time we talk about hitting roadblocks when learning new things. What do you think? Do you learn the same way or in a different way? How do you strike a balance between sharpening the saw and cutting wood, between learning more and doing?\n\nPlease feel free to ask me anything else for upcoming Q&As :)"
