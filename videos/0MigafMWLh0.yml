Many highly interactive and novel experiments have been created, which enable everyone of us to make music even without any musical experience. Adding the Gamepad API to the experiments even enriches the user's experience in exploring the music creation process.\n\nThis talk will show the basics of dealing with both APIs and it will contain experiments that show how well both APIs go together.\"\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
