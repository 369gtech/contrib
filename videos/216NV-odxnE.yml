description: "This video was recorded at Code Mesh LDN 19 - http://bit.ly/37xc3Nr\n\nGet involved in Code Sync's next conference - http://bit.ly/2Mcm4aS\n\n---\n\nTHE ART OF CHALLENGING ASSUMPTIONS\nby Maxim Fedorov\n\nTALK LEVEL: Intermediate\n\nABSTRACT\nWe spent countless hours and sleepless nights bringing and keeping up server-side of the most successful messaging service in the world. Looking back, how many choices we'd change? And how to ensure we make the right one next time? \"\"The real problem is that programmers have spent far too much time worrying about efficiency in the wrong places and at the wrong times;\_premature optimization is the root of all evil\"\" (Donald Knuth). But why does it happen? Why did we do something we didn't really want?\nBecause we acted on assumptions. \n\nThis talk will guide through a number of war stories where assumptions were made and acted on. There were regrets and disappointments, and we learned to challenge assumptions in the hard way. Now it's time to share what we learnt so far.\n\nSlides & full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/maxim-fedorov/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - MAXIM FEDOROV\nEvil mother of all mistakes\n\nMaxim Fedorov is a software engineer at WhatsApp, the largest messaging app. Maximâ€™s work is focused on performance and scalability of the server-side.\n\nBefore WhatsApp, Maxim has been developing low-latency TCP/IP applications at NetAlliance (Sydney, Australia), designing Kaspersky Enterprise Security Endpoint (Moscow, Russia), improving Parallels Virtual Automation, called Odin now, at Parallels (former SWsoft), and developing network security software before.\n\nMore on Maxim Fedorov: https://codesync.global/speaker/maxim-fedorov/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE MESH LDN 19\nCode Mesh LDN is powered by Code Sync.
