title: 'YOW! West 2016 Jacky Li - Architecture Refactoring on Legacy Code Base'
recordingDate: 1468196690
description: "It’s very hard to do architecture changes on a legacy system, but with correct refactoring skills and techniques we managed to apply Presentation-Domain-Data pattern on realestate.com.au’s 6-year-old iOS code base.\n\nWe did this without creating a feature branch and while continuing ongoing feature development, we were still able to submit to Apple every 4 weeks.\n\nI’m going to share my experience in this talk: The refactoring strategies needed on a legacy code base, how to change the architecture without breaking the system, and what we learned along the way.\n\nJacky is a senior mobile developer at realestate.com.au. and has been working on iOS for 4 years. He is primarily responsible for delivering REA’s iOS app. Prior to joining REA, he was a senior consultant with ThoughtWorks. Over the past 7 years, he has helped many companies with agile organisational transformation and adopting continuous integration in large teams.\n\nFor more on YOW!
