title: 'YOW! Connected 2016 Donny Kurniawan - Automating iOS CI Infrastructure at REA Group'
recordingDate: 1486941316
description: "The iOS team at REA Group is expanding. This necessitates a better tooling and continuous integration (CI) infrastructure to maintain our agility and speed in delivering app releases. Recognising this, we have improved our process and CI infrastructure by utilising Buildkite and automation tools.\n\nIn this talk, we’ll start by discussing our motivation, the previous CI infrastructure, and team requirements. Then, we will talk about the new infrastructure. Specifically:\n\n* Overview of Buildkite and how it meets our requirements\n* The overall CI architecture and build machines\n* Automating the creation of build machines\n* How the new CI integrates with our development process\n\nThis talk will be a great opportunity to learn about the challenges we faced and lessons we’ve learnt around automating iOS CI infrastructure at REA Group.\n\nDonny is a senior developer at REA Group. Besides spending time with his family, he enjoys programming and developing software; and trying to achieve Reading List Zero. In his PhD, Donny designed and developed an IDE for writing, running, and debugging parallel applications on distributed and heterogeneous platforms.\n\nFor more on YOW!
