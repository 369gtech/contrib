Scripting is hardly a fancy new idea but unlike most other dynamic languages Lua is designed for this purpose. In this talk we will cover Luerl, emphasizing its trade-off as thin skin on top of the BEAM ecosystem. The simplicity and small size in its design, and its use of a few simple but powerful mechanisms."
