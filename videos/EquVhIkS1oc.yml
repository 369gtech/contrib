description: 'Tanzu Service Mesh, previously called NSX Service Mesh, is VMwareâ€™s unique entry into the service mesh arena. In this demo, a Global Namespace is created to deploy an abstracted application framework across clouds and Kubernetes clusters. We also show how easy it is to onboard new clusters to our service and build a new GNS to establish its service discovery and encryption capabilities.'
