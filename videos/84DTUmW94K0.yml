description: "Last year I left academia and got a job at a startup as a Python programmer. I thought I knew the language pretty well, but a few months in I was surprised to discover a language feature I hadn't known about. Python classes have special methods that can be used to have the classes pretend to be built-in types like lists and dictionaries. They're kind of a cross between tied variables and roles, but they're really their own thing. And if you're primarily interacting with packages via log messages they can be hard to discover if you don't know they exist.\n\nThis will be mostly a talk about Python, but where possible I'll compare things to similar features in Perl."
