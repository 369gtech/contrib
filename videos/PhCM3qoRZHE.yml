description: "Nvidia published a recent paper that detailed a system able to progressively grow the architecture of a generative adversarial network during the training phase. This network was able to produce images nearing photorealism at a faster pace than previous models, pretty exciting stuff! I'll explain how it works both in theory and code in this video. \n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/Progressive_GANs/tree/master\n\nPlease Subscribe! And like. And comment.
