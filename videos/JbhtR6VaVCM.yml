description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nTowards a Standardized Application Definition Model for Kubernetes - Phil Prasek, Upbound & Sudhanva Huruli, Microsoft \n\nWith multiple Kubernetes application models emerging to capture the complex set of cloud resources and their connectivity, how do these approaches stack up and is there a path towards a standardized Kubernetes application model that becomes the unit of scheduling across clusters, regions, and clouds?  In this talk we’ll explore two emerging application models: the KubernetesApplication in Crossplane (a multi-cloud control plane) and the Open Application Model (OAM) from Microsoft and Alibaba. We’ll provide an overview of strengths and opportunities of each approach and directions towards converging around a standardized application model as part of the newly formed CNCF SIG: sig-app-delivery.\n\nhttps://sched.co/ZelS"
