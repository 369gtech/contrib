description: "If you’re reading this, you are at least a little curious about public speaking. Maybe you think it’s an awesome activity, but feel you just don’t have the spark it takes? In this talk, Taylor Swift, Rihanna, Alanis Morissette and I will tap into your individual star power!\n\nThis talk will give you a complete toolbox to create a great tech-talk, share your knowledge and inspire others. We will go over the creative process starting at brainstorming ideas through to creating a great presentation, and all the way up to effective storytelling.\n\nBio: Dafna has extensive experience in designing, implementing, and testing software systems on various architectures, from microcontrollers to high-performance computing systems.\nDafna is passionate about technology and loves sharing her knowledge with others by giving lectures, tech-blogging, and taking part in meetups and other tech-related events."
