title: 'AdoptOpenJDK: Enhancing OpenJDK’s “build, test, contribute” pipeline'
language: English
recordingDate: 1526547766
description: "with George Adams & Tim Ellison\n\nThe AdoptOpenJDK project provides high quality Java SE binaries based upon an open, common, audited, build infrastructure.\n\nIn this talk we describe the recent work that brings OpenJDK-based development to everyone by developing a modern devops pipeline to take your idea from discussion to final delivery.\n\nHear about how AdoptOpenJDK established a large heterogeneous build farm in the community, is using that to manage new build/test infrastructure, and has created a flexible website site for the release of builds.\n\nJoin us as we show the lifecycle of a patch from concept to delivery in hundreds of thousands of downloads. This talk will appeal to devops and Java developers alike.\n\nhttp://adoptopenjdk.net"
