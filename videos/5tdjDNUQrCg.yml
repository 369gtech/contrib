description: "An introduction to the Eddystone beacon standard. An open standard, that allows Bluetooth LE beacons to boardcast several types of frames, including URL, simple ID's, ephemeral encrypted ID's and even the state of it's battery. Even Chrome for iOS and Android have full support now to receive these beacons URL's. We'll do a quick demo and give some real world use-cases.\n\nAlex Van Boxel is a polyglot, technology enthusiast and works as Big Data Architect at Vente-Exclusive.com. He has an R&D past at Alcatel-Lucent and Progress Software. He's part of the Devoxx steering so he will be running around with a Blue sweater.\n\n[WAL-0861]"
