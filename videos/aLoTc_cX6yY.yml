title: 'dask-sql: Query Your (Big) Data With The Power of Python & SQL - Nils Braun'

description: "PyData NYC/Philly/Miami virtual meetup\n\n\nSlides: https://bit.ly/2JkFOtx \n\n\nAccessing and working with data is increasingly important for the success of a project or a company. Traditionally, relational (SQL) databases have been used for this and many developers and non-developers working with data are very familiar with the SQL query language. However, the requirements of today's landscape are much more complicated: machine learning, complicated distributed clusters of machines, large amounts of data - all of this does not play well with the world of SQL databases. \n\nThe Dask ecosystem and the dask-sql library try to bridge this gap. Dask enables its users to easily scale data-intensive Python applications and comes with a large number of extensions, e.g. for machine learning. dask-sql adds a SQL query layer on top of the Dask ecosystem, which allows to query big and small data from SQL and scale the computations via a Dask cluster - without interacting with the complexities of a distributed system.\n\nIn this talk, we will cover Dask as the basis for a scalable Python ecosystem and then explore the SQL query engine dask-sql and how it might help to combine the best of both the SQL and Python world. After that, a demo session will demonstrate how you can set up dask-sql on your own cluster and quickly analyze your (big) data.\_\n \n\nAbout the speaker:\n\nNils is a Data Engineer and core developer of the dask-sql and tsfresh libraries. He did his PhD in particle physics at an experiment in Japan, where he got used to big and complex data architectures. He was working both as a Data Scientist and as a Data Engineer and knows how hard it is, to combine the two worlds. Currently, he is responsible for the Data Engineer training and mentoring at the Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence in Stuttgart, Germany.\n\n\n\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\n\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
