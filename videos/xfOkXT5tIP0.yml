description: "Michael Nowak reviewed Oracle's Maximum Availability Architecture (MAA)as it applies to Exadata. The key goal of MAA is to achieve optimal high availability, data protection and disaster recovery for Oracle customers at the lowest cost and complexity. MAA consists of Reference Architectures for various buckets of HA Service Level Agreements, configuration practices and HA Life Cycle operational best practices and are applicable for non-engineered systems, engineered systems, non-cloud and cloud deployments.\n\nHighlights\n\n0:32 Michael Nowak introduction\n1:01 Overview\n2:15 Cost of Downtime and the importance of high availability (HA)\n3:11 What is Maximum Availability Architecture (MAA)\n5:11 What is MAA: MAA tiers\n6:36 Exadata built from the ground up for HA\n7:14 10 years of Exadata\n7:44 Exadataâ€™s Exachk origin\n9:04 Unplanned outages topics\n9:06 Do-not-service LED on Exadata storage server\n10:04 Partnering in ASM\n12:21 M.2 Drive Fast Failure Protection\n14:51 Database tier I/O cancellation\n17:49 Smart OLTP Caching\n21:07 Smart Rebalancing for high redundancy diskgroups\n24:34 Fast Node Death detection\n25:59 What is a Disaster?  and Data Guard Standby\n28:52 Standby metrics: Redo apply rates, detection and fast-start failover\n30:17 Planned maintenance topics\n30:21 video demo: database node update using patch manager tool\n32:50 video demo: Exadata online storage expansion using OEDACLI tool\n36:08 Adding storage: Exadata AWR showing outlier detection and how cells cache data\n39:09 Exadata MAA evolution & direction\n40:17 Q&A Section\n40:22 Q: Single Exadata rack HA? A:Rack full of redundancy, we don't see rack failures\n41:40 Q: What are the toughest problems you confront in HA? A: Sick/misbehaving components that don't meet their own service levels (as opposed to fail-stop components) Hard to diagnose, e.g., take disk offline and diagnose via ORION.\n44:12 Q: How do you find out that MAA is working well? A: IDC's 5-nines, customer that reports 5 years of operation without issues \n\nAskTOM Office Hours offers free, monthly training and tips on how to make the most of Oracle Database, from Oracle product managers, developers and evangelists.\n\nhttps://asktom.oracle.com/\n\nOracle Developers portal: https://developer.oracle.com/\nSign up for an Oracle Cloud trial: https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/tryit"
