description: "DOES19 Las Vegas â€” For teams in our organization, DevOps has felt like a mountain which must be scaled, and arriving at the summit was the measure of success. Many teams felt this was too daunting an effort and struggled to start. We lost sight of the journey and were too focused on the (perceived) destination.\n \nWe realized we were focused on the wrong thing.\n \nNow we have stopped talking at teams about the values and importance of DevOps. Instead, we are meeting teams and leaders where they are today, and using DevOps practices to solve problems they care about. In this talk I'll share some of the starting points for teams we have worked with, and how we have helped them to overcome their fear of the unknown and embrace DevOps as a journey rather than a destination.\n\nDOES19 Las Vegas\nDOES 2019 US\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
