title: 'YOW! 2013 Trisha Gee - What do you Mean, Backwards Compatibility?'
recordingDate: 1514387376
description: "The Java driver for MongoDB has been around almost as long as the NoSQL database itself. It was designed without some of the modern Java features we now take for granted, and the API might be easier with features like lambdas.\n\nThe existing Java driver is extensively used, which leads to a tricky question: how do you create a new API that uses modern development patterns whilst retaining backwards compatibility? Your users are fundamental to the success of your business, you do not want to alienate them, break their systems or make it hard for them to migrate to the New World Order.\n\nIn this presentation Trisha will share some of the pain experienced and solutions tried while creating a new Java driver for MongoDB.\n\nTrisha has developed Java applications for a range of industries, including finance, manufacturing, software and non-profit, for companies of all sizes. She has expertise in Java high performance systems, is passionate about enabling developer productivity, and dabbles with Open Source development. Trisha is a leader of the Sevilla Java User Group and a Java Champion, she believes community and sharing ideas helps us learn from mistakes and build on successes. She’s a Developer Advocate for JetBrains, which means she gets to share all the interesting things she’s constantly discovering.\n\nFor more on YOW!
