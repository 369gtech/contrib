description: "Speaker: Arul Kumaran, Logical Steps\n\nEven now, many assume PHP is only synchronous and not capable of async processes, which is wrong.\n\nAsynchronous execution has several advantages. Letting you multitask on a single thread. That is cooperative multitasking. Each running task gives the control back to the system when idle. For example, waiting for an HTTP response or IO operation.\n\nAll these are well and fine, but the asynchronous code is messy and hard to maintain. This presentation shows how to write async code in a synchronous fashion to get the best of both worlds.\n\nGenerators with the yield keyword, are the most underused feature in PHP. It has great potential. We can take advantage of them by implementing async and await in PHP on our own!\n\nAbout the speaker\n\nArul is a self-taught full stack developer. He is the Author of Restler API Server Framework. He founded Luracast, to provide developers with free tools and open source software. He is currently working on the blockchain solution integrating PHP. Home automation and IOT is his latest hobby.\n\nEvent Page: https://2018.phpconf.asia\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/lcA6/"
