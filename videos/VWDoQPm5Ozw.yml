title: '¡Escuincla babosa!: Creating a telenovela script in three Python deep learning frameworks'
recordingDate: 1557111092
description: "\"Speaker: Lorena Mesa\n\nTelenovelas are beloved for their over the top drama and intricate plot twists. In this talk, we’ll review popular telenovelas to synthesize a typical telenovela arc and use it to train a deep learning model.\n\nWhat would a telenovela script look like as imagined by a neural network? To answer this question, we’ll examine three Python deep learning frameworks - Keras, PyTorch, and TensorFlow - to determine the process of translating a telenovela into a neural network and ultimately determine which one will be best for the task at hand. Be prepared for amor, pasiòn, and y el misterioso!\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2019 and https://github.com/PyCon/2019-slides\""
