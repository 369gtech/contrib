language: English
recordingDate: 1502110706
description: "This session explores how the fundamental ingredients of open source software such as Linux, Apache Spark, and MongoDB, and mathematics running on Oracle Bare Metal Cloud Services are marshaled in the creation of an innovative solution to data persistence and in-memory data processing. This serves to make corporate data more secure in the cloud than it is on-premises, while implicitly addressing compliance with territorial privacy law, particularly GDPR.\n\nSpeaker:  Gary Mawdsley"
