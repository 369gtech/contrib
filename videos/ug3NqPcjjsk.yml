The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nContainerizing Java Applications for Kubernetes With Jib - Qingyang Chen & Appu Goundan, Google\n\nContainers are at the heart of many complex distributed systems. But, for Java developers, building containers is a common obstacle on the road to Kubernetes adoption. Traditionally, Dockerfiles define container builds imperatively, which can be cumbersome, error-prone, and slow. In this talk, we’ll introduce a container image builder called Jib. Jib is declarative - it packs a Java application into a container by inferring what it needs from your Maven or Gradle project. Jib is fast, builds containers reproducibly, and allows Java developers to use the build tools they are already familiar with. We’ve released Jib as an open-source project and want to share how you too can leverage its capabilities to speed up your development process and orchestrate larger, more complex systems.\n\nTo learn more click here: https://sched.co/FuJT"
