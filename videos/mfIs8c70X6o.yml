description: "General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is EU's show of force to protect individuals' digital rights and data.\n\nWe all know when it arrives, 25 May 2018. Still, after much talk, we don't know how it will affect us architects and developers. The GDPR requires careful handling of personal data, mentioning encryption, pseudonymizations and more.\n\nHow do we translate this to practical implementations?\n\nHow do we give users access to their data?\n\nHow do we delete them?\n\nJoin this talk about how to transform GDPR jargon to code.\n\nGuiding us is Niclas Kjellin with his long experience in software development insecurity. Niclas works at Softhouse Consulting as a security expert. He is a certified ethical hacker and certified in GDPR. The one thing he learnt over the years, is that security comes from blood, sweat and through other's experience.
