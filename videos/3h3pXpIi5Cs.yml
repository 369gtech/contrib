title: 'JavaFX for the Enterprise with OpenDolphin'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433505786
description: "Java enterprise applications run on the server. They still need a display, though, and the most capable one is JavaFX on the desktop. OpenDolphin introduces a shared presentation model for merging these two worlds. The enterprise application controls what should be displayed, and the client displays that application state and its transitions with all the beauty of JavaFX, including animations, effects, 3-D worlds, and custom controls. If you run a server-centric architecture and still seek to provide the best-possible user experience, this session is for you.\n\n\nAuthor:\nDierk Koenig\nDierk KÃ¶nig (JavaOne Rock Star) works as a fellow for Canoo Engineering AG, Basel, Switzerland.\nHe is a committer to many open-source projects including OpenDolphin, Groovy, Grails, GPars and GroovyFX.\nHe is lead author of the \"Groovy in Action\" book, which is among the publisher's best-selling titles of the decade.\nView more trainings by Dierk Koenig at https://www.parleys.com/author/dierk-koenig\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
