description: "Hi All, to keep you going with your monthly fill of Serverless tech, we are bringing you an online edition this week thanks to the fine folks at YOW! Conferences.\n\nJoin Sydney Serverless at https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/Sydney-Serverless-Meetup-Group\n\nSpeakers:\nðŸŽ¤ Simon Waight, Azure Pro Developer Lead, Microsoft\nBuilding loosely coupled serverless solutions with Azure Event Grid\nEven in the new world of Serverless we continue to see traditional software design challenges such as tight coupling between serverless components. In this session we will look at how we can build loosely coupled serverless solutions in Azure by using Event Grid and run an interactive demo to demonstrate how we can quickly add new handlers to our serverless pipelines without needing to modify publishers.\nSimon is the Azure Pro Developer Lead in Sydney for Microsoft. He has more years of experience than he cares to remember in online solution architecture and delivery and has held roles spanning software development, infrastructure architecture and IT operations, and finds modern cloud practices embodied by the DevOps culture to be a sweet spot. During his career Simon has participated in many teams and has a strong understanding of the collaborative nature of successful projects. He enjoys sharing his experience with others and is always happy to chat tech!\n\nðŸŽ¤ Denis Bauer, Head of Cloud Computing Bioinformatics, CSIRO\nServerless Bioinformatics helping to fight the COVID19 pandemic\nDeveloping vaccines, treatments and diagnostics are some of the key weapons in the fight against the COVID19 pandemic. CSIRO has become an integral part in this global response by having established one of the first pre-clinical models for testing vaccine, treatment and diagnostic candidates. Underpinning this achievement was the work on understanding the genome of this novel virus; its blue-print, which holds instructions about its behaviour and what kind of disease it can cause. With several new virus strains decoded and deposited into a global repository daily, the dataset for this genomic analysis has rapidly expanded to tens of Millions of data points; each potentially holding the information about the viruseâ€™s future trajectory and the virulence of individual strains. Using advanced bioinformatics, powered by the scalability of serverless technology, we were able to gain insights from this unprecedented resource to help develop robust and representative models to test public health interventions."
