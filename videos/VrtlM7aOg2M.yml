description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nAuthN and AuthZ at Cruise: Crawl, Walk, Run - James Barclay & Roman Porter, Cruise\n\nAuthentication and authorization are crucial to achieving a zero trust security model. But how do you apply them to your organization in a simple and digestible way? Do you prescribe each engineering team what to do and give them the tools to do it? Do you enforce it globally? Our approach to handling authentication and authorization within our Kubernetes clusters at Cruise has matured over the years, and we’d like to take you through the history, challenges, and (what we think are) unique solutions to these problems at our scale."
