title: 'Party REPL � A multi-player REPL built for  pair-programming - Tomomi Livingstone + Hans Livingstone'

recordingDate: 1543616871
description: 'Most development tools are single-player — Party REPL is the first REPL built from the ground up around pair-programming. Modern editors such as Atom allow for collaborative editing of code, but for REPL users this is only half of the story. So we’re never alone, Party REPL enables real-time sharing of running application state which allows us to always invite a friend to write, run and debug code together. Built in ClojureScript as an Atom plugin, Party REPL is designed to be easily modifiable and supports multiple protocols including unREPL. In this talk we’ll explore how a collaborative REPL can impact the way we work, step through how Party REPL was built, and examine how you can build your own collaborative development tools that leverage Atom via ClojureScript.'
