description: "Emma Delescolle\n\nMonday 17th, 15:00 (Assembly Room)\nA talk (25 minutes)\nIn the past few years we have seen a lot of advances regarding the hardware python can run on.\n\nYou're probably used to Python running on \"regular\" computers. But 10 years ago a revolution started with the Raspberry Pi that was one of the first computers in decades, thanks to its GPIO headers, which allowed easy control of electronic hardware from a programming language.\n\nThat was the dawn of a new era that opened-up electronic hardware programming with python on multiple devices as micro-controllers like the BBC Micro:bit thanks to MicroPyton and plenty of other MCU's running either MicroPython or CircuitPython (a friendly fork of MicroPython).\n\nBut it doesn't stop there, Python can also run on phones and tablets thanks to BeeWare and Kivy.\n\nThe speaker suggested this session is suitable for new programmers.\nThe speaker suggested this session is suitable for teachers.\nThe speaker suggested this session is suitable for data scientists."
