recordingDate: 1486917174
description: 'DevOps is not simply building a continuous delivery pipeline and many people feel that they’ve been ‘doing’ devops (or trying to!) for many years. So why, exactly, has the term received so much attention? What really is it? In this talk, Helen explores the devops trend, its roots and history and its purpose as a transformational, evolutionary movement to make better software, faster and more safely. She will discuss its relationships with Agile, Lean and ITSM and review how organisations have successfully, and not so successfully, used devops to elevate the way their business delivers innovation to their customers.'
