description: "Lightning talks (approx 10-15 minutes each)\n\n\nWhy Blockchain doesn't make sense - Michael John Pena  00:00\n\nBlockchain is more of a Social and Philosophical change rather than technology. That is why often times it doesn't make clear sense to developers and technologists.\n\nThis lightning talk will cover the speaker's journey on why Blockchain as a concept doesn't make sense at the beginning. He will then share his experience along the sleepless nights of asking \"Why Blockchain?\" and came up with some good answers.\n\n---------------------\n\nAsk Alexa: How Developers Can Design Engaging Conversations with Voice - Azi Farjad     16:10\n\nJoin Azi Farjad, Developer Evangelist for Amazon Alexa, as she provides insights on how voice experiences have transformed the way that customers interact with the world around them. This poses a unique challenge for developers to understand design patterns in voice space and to build engaging conversations. \n\nIn this session, we look at the experience as a whole and take you through key learnings that you can use when building for voice with Alexa skills. We provide tips of how to create engaging voice experiences for users and will familiarize you with design patterns in voice space. We will also share how to implement the experience with Alexa.\n\n---------------------\n\nBuild your own GraphQL server in 10 minutes - Ben Teese     29:30\n\nGraphQL and its associated frontend libraries like Relay and Apollo Client are now reasonably well known in the industry. However, GraphQL backends are a little less well understood. Whilst there are backend-as-a-service platforms available for applications that are entirely green-field, for the rest of us it’s more than likely that, in order to accomodate all of the intricacies of our business domain and infrastructure, we’ll have to build a GraphQL backend ourselves.\n\nIn this presentation I’ll show how it's surprisingly easy to get a basic GraphQL backend up-and-running in 10 minutes. Using the Apollo Server framework as a foundation, I’ll build a backend from scratch to service an existing client. Along the way I’ll introduce the concept of GraphQL resolvers and show how you write them, nest and pass data between them, and support both queries and mutations.\n\nHaving got the basics up and running, I’ll then talk about what next steps would be for security and performance, and, for those with an aversion to JavaScript, what server frameworks are available for other languages.\n\nAttendees will leave this presentation with an understanding of the key concepts when building a GraphQL server, and an appreciation of just how easy it can be to get started.\n\n---------------------\n\nBuilding Single Page Applications with ASP.NET Core 2.1 - Jason Taylor       42:37\n\nThis lightning talk will teach you how to get started building Single Page Applications with React or Angular and ASP.NET Core 2.1. This talk will cover the basics, ensuring that you have a seamless experience from development to production.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcsydney.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
