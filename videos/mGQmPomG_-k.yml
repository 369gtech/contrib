description: "Join us at and Take a FREE Webinar : http://www.edureka.co/android-development-certification-course\nThis android tutorial talks about Services in detail:\nRead more about services at: \n\nhttp://www.edureka.co/blog/android-tutorials-beginners-service-component/\n\nWhat are Services in Android System?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n1) Faceless components: The components of Android system that run in the background are Service components. They are very much like activities, only without a User Interface.\n\n2) Taking care of long running background tasks: They carry out long-running tasks desired by the application (without user intervention). Services run the background tasks that do not require a User Interface.\n\n3) Unaffected by activity switching: Each Service has a specific job, and they keep at it if you switch between different Activities, or even if you switch to a different application altogether.\n\n4) It can also provide functionality to other applications.\n\n5) Example of Service: A good example is your music player.\n\nWhen you play music in your Android handset using a playlist, the music player takes care of the job itself, without user intervention. You do not have to change the song every time one song ends. This automation is due to the service component of Android.\n\nUser can switch from this application to another without stopping  the service.\ne.g. Music Player, Network Download\n\nForms of Services : \n----------------------------\n\nA Service can have two forms:\n\n1) Started/Unbound: In this case, an application component starts the service, and it would continue to run in the background, even if the original component that initiated it is destroyed. For instance, when started, a service would continue to play music in the background indefinitely.\n\n2) Bound: An Android component may bind itself to a Service using bindservice (). A bound service would run as long as the other application components are bound to it. As soon as they unbind, the service destroys itself.\n\nAn unbound activity runs indefinitely, whereas the lifespan of a bound activity depends on the application components that bind to it.\n\nKnow more about Services - \n\nhttp://www.edureka.co/blog/android-tutorials-beginners-service-component/\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nPlease write back to us at support@edureka.in or call us at +91-8880862004 for more information. \nhttp://www.edureka.co\n\nUse the link to watch all videos of this session :\nhttp://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9ooVrP1hQOHiWL2R-gYcF8oA4yPJKTNb"
