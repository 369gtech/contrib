description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nTechDocs: Unlocking the Potential of Engineers' Collective Knowledge - Emma Indal, Spotify\n\nEmma is an engineer with a big goal: her new service should provide the best developer experience, including well-maintained, discoverable and usable documentation. So she thinks, “Which tool should I use to write my docs?” followed by “How will other engineers find it?” What if she could instead, in one click, get docs generated together with her service when it's created? Documentation that lives in her repository, together with her code. Documentation that becomes discoverable automatically, to all engineers within the organization. Documentation in one single place: Backstage. This talk will guide you through how we fulfilled Emma’s big goal by adopting the “docs like code” approach and developing TechDocs, one of the core features of Backstage. It will also walk you through why we decided to open source this successful internal product to remove the friction of writing and discovering technical documentation for all engineers."
