description: "In this episode, Robert is joined by Sourabh Shirhatti, who shows how to build a gRPC service with Visual Studio. Sourabh starts with an introduction to gRPC, a language agnostic, high-performance Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework, and reviews why it was created and what benefits it has over other ways of building services. Sourabh then creates a service from scratch in Visual Studio and then builds an app to call it. \n\n\n\nResources:\n\nIntroduction to gRPC on .NET Core (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/grpc/?view=aspnetcore-3.1&viewFallbackFrom=aspnetcore-3.1%2F%3FWT.mc_id%3Dvstoolbox-c9-niner)\n\n\nTutorial: Create a gRPC client and server in ASP.NET Core (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/grpc/grpc-start?view=aspnetcore-3.1&tabs=visual-studio)\n\n\ngRPC services with C# (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/grpc/basics?view=aspnetcore-3.1&viewFallbackFrom=aspnetcore-3.1%2F%3FWT.mc_id%3Dvstoolbox-c9-niner)\n\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\n\nATTRIBUTION CREDITS:\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ru5x_hDZ9Qw"
