description: "Recent years have seen a flood of novel wireless exploits, from vulnerable medical devices to hacked OT devices, with exploitation moving beyond 802.11 and into more obscure standard and proprietary protocols. While other non-WiFi RF protocols remain a mystery to many security practitioners, exploiting them is easier than one might think. Today, cyber threats have grown not just in its depth (more sophisticated) but also in its breadth (expanded scope). It has grown from threats in Enterprise IT systems to Operation Technologies (OT) and Industrial Control Systems (ICS).\n\nTo ensure wireless security, one needs to have a comprehensive understanding of the technology, threats, exploits, and defensive techniques along with experience in evaluating and attacking wireless technology. Not limiting one’s skill-set to WiFi, we also need to evaluate the threat from other standards-based and proprietary wireless technologies as well. This session takes an in-depth look at the security challenges of many different wireless technologies, exposing one to wireless security threats through the eyes of an attacker. Using readily available and custom-developed tools, we’ll navigate our way through the techniques attackers use to exploit RF networks. The session will introduce one how to identify the threats that expose wireless technology and build on this knowledge to implement defensive techniques that can be used to protect wireless systems.\n\n=== \n\nHarshit Agrawal is a student, developer, an independent security researcher. He is a part of All Day DevOps Community, and presented his security research paper at conferences like Hack In Paris, Hack In The Box, RSAC USA, ICS Singapore, and Hakon. He is President for CSI chapter, and Vice President for Innovation Cell at MIT. Currently, he is leading a team of security enthusiast at MIT which gave him good insight about cyber-security and helped to emerge as a creative leader. On the other hand, it also increased his thirst to explore more in this field. He believes in providing something out of the box!\n\n--- \n\nHimanshu Mehta currently working as a Senior Security Researcher at Xen1thLabs is passionate about Computer Security and due to this reason he actively and responsibly discloses security vulnerabilities to vendors. He was involved in several bug bounty and Capture the Flag programs. He is the board member of the EC-Council Licensed Penetration Tester group, Convet.it and Currnt. He has been invited as Chief Guest for several security events and presented his security research paper at international security conferences like RSAC, ICS Singapore, Hack In Paris, HITB Dubai/Amsterdam, InfoSecurity, Hakon, Offzone. He previously leads a team of security intelligence at Symantec which gave him good insight about cyber-security and helped to emerge as a creative leader."
