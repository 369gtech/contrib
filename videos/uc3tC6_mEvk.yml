title: '.NET Core 3.0 Desktop Apps - Creating and Publishing WPF and WinForm Apps in .NET Core'
language: English
recordingDate: 1564401609
description: ".NET Core 3.0 promises to be a big update to how we build desktop applications in C#. With it comes upgrades to .NET Core for Winform apps and WPF apps. In this video, we are going to look at how to build and package WPF apps in .NET Core 3.0. We will also look at a .NET Framework WPF application for comparison to see what has changed. Finally, we will look at a WinForm app in .NET Core 3.0, although that will be a bit different.\n\nThis video uses the preview 7 release of .NET Core 3.0. We are looking ahead at what will be, not what you should be using today for production applications. WPF is now stable enough to demo, but you will notice that the WinForm app is more difficult to work with since it does not yet have a visual designer.\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/IAmTimCorey\n\nNewsletter signup (with exclusive discounts, giveaways, and more):  https://signup.iamtimcorey.com/\n\nSource Code Download: https://leadmagnets.app/?Resource=Core3Desktop"
