description: "Using a trusty Raspberry Pi and a bunch of sensors, this session will take the attendees on an end-to-end journey using Windows 10 IoT Core and the the IoT stack in Microsoft Azure.\n\nThe solution will build out a scenario from sensors all the way through to visualisation and insight, and provide attendees with a real experience in the world of the Internet of Things.\n\nThe Internet of Things is experiencing huge growth and the session will provide a walkthrough of the key areas that constitute a solution, providing attendees with a good starting point from which to build their own solutions."
