language: English
recordingDate: 1525539629
description: "The fundamental performance characteristics of Node.js, along with the improvements driven through the community benchmarking workgroup, makes Node.js ideal for highly performing micro-service workloads. Translating that into highly responsive, scalable solutions however is still far from easy. This session will discuss why Node.js is right for micro-services, introduce the best practices for building scalable deployments, and show you how to monitor and profile your applications to identify and resolve performance bottlenecks.\n\nEVENT:\n\nNodeJS Interactive North America 2017\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nChris Bailey, IBM\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nThe Linux Foundation provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fbhhc4jtGW4&t=12s"
