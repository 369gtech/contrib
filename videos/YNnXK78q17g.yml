description: "The Redux state container came out in June 2015 and quickly became the preferred solution for handling state in complex React applications. At Rangle.io they embraced Redux very early and proceeded to use it in over 20 projects, spanning a range of applications and involving both React and Angular. In this talk Yuri will take a look at their experience with using Redux on those projects and discuss some of the advanced Redux topics.\n\nYuri Takhteyev\nCTO, Rangle.io\nhttps://twitter.com/qaramazov\n\nOn March 4, 2017, FITC hosted another Spotlight event, this time focusing on ReactJS. The event was sponsored and brought to you by Nulogy."
