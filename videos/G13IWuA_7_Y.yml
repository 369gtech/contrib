recordingDate: 1493102062
description: "The JavaScript community is relatively immature in the testing space, with many people making the same mistakes many other communities have been making for ages.\nIn this talk Jake will be covering many of the mistakes he has made in testing over the years in other ecosystems and how he has taken these learnings to write great JavaScript tests which are a pleasure to work with and do not get in your way."
