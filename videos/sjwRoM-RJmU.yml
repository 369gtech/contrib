title: 'Kevin Gosse — Debugging one layer deeper'
recordingDate: 1631117741
description: "Ближайшая конференция: \nDotNext 2021 Moscow — 21-22 октября, онлайн.\nПодробности и билеты: https://bit.ly/3BTQype\n\n. As .NET developers, we are used to the comfort of the managed world, hiding a lot of the underlying complexity. But what do to when a bug is so intricate that you have to step into the native world and dig into the runtime? This talk is a recollection of previous investigations, where Kevin will explain how he had to go one layer deeper to diagnose and solve tricky bugs, sometimes in the CLR itself. A session about WinDBG, LLDB, reverse-engineering assembly code, and digging into the internals of the .NET runtime."
