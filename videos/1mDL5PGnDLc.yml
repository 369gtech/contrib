description: "PyData Berlin 2018 \n\nDid you ever try to scare a fish by tapping on the glass of an aquarium? What happens in the fish brain if you do that? What would happen in a fish school? In my project I tried to answer these questions via computational modelling and I will tell you how packages such as numba, pypet, and matplotlib allowed me to efficiently simulate the model and visualize results in a reproducible way.\n\nSlides: https://github.com/awakenting/master-thesis/blob/master/pydata_2018_presentation_slides.pdf\n---\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
