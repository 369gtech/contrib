description: "Deploy the admin-ui as a CloudFoundry Application [B] - Michael Grifalconi, SAP    \n\nThere are many applications that donâ€™t exactly fit the 12-factor rules but it would still be useful to deploy them on Cloud Foundry.\n\nSAP used the admin-ui project as a BOSH release to monitor the status of its Cloud Foundry deployments until it was considered an unnecessary effort to maintain a BOSH deployment for the specific use case. Unfortunately, admin-ui was not designed to be deployed as Cloud Foundry application.\n\nThe solution was to wrap the application in a way that allows the user to set all necessary configuration parameters in the manifest and deploy it on Cloud Foundry. Even if the talk will focus on the admin-ui, the procedure can be applied to any application which does not support injection of configuration parameters as environment variables like standard Cloud Foundry applications.\n\nMichael Grifalconi\nSAP SE\nDeveloper\nMichael Grifalconi is a Developer at the SAP Cloud Platform since 2015 and his main work field is DevOps where he contributes to deploy, maintain and update Cloud Foundry, infrastructure monitoring as well as continuous delivery solutions using BOSH for all deployments. His first experience on cloud topics starts in 2013 where he worked on OpenStack deployments and application auto-scaling technologies at university."
