language: English
recordingDate: 1542074802
description: "“Reconnaissance is about gathering information. The information gathered is only as good as the insights and actionable decisions that we can gain from it. A lot of research is focused on finding OSINT data but little is done towards converting the data into insights and actionable decisions. Visualisation is an easy and efficient way to gain insights from any the data gleaned.\n\nIn this workshop, we will look at how we can gather OSINT data and visualise it using free and open source solutions. Visualising data is not enough, we’ll also look at how we can use the metrics to answer business questions and lead to actionable decisions.\n\nWe’ll tackle the problem by breaking it into following steps:\n\nGathering OSINT data\nStoring the OSINT data\nProcessing & visualising the data\nGaining insights and making actionable decisions\nSome specific use-cases we’ll look at during the workshop includes:\n\nMonitoring an organisation’s SSL/TLS certificates, domains and subdomains in near-real time\nCreating dashboards using public datasets(scans.io) to gain insights into an organisation’s external posture\nBuilding monitoring and alerting solutions using OSINT data that will help us take business decisions\nParticipants will get\n\nStep by Step Gitbook covering the entire training (html, pdf, epub, mobi)\nCustom scripts, playbooks and tools used as part of the workshop\nScenarios that can be readily implemented for your use cases\nReferences to the data used in the workshop"
