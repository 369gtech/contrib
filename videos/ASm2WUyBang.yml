description: "Visit the largest developers congress in Europe: WeAreDevelopers World Congress, 16 - 18 May 2018 in Vienna, Austria.\n\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/congress/\n\nI invite you to embark on a voyage with me. It will be a time lapse version of a voyage I undertook myself at my previous employer, a Vienna-based company that develops business applications for data management for the financial services industry. As part of a team that worked on a product for managing corporate actions data, I spearheaded the introduction of Behaviour Driven Development (BDD). Using BDD, we were able to address weaknesses in the way that requirements were analysed, communicated and verified. \n\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/wearedevelopers.org/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/wearedevs/\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/wearedevelopers.org/"
