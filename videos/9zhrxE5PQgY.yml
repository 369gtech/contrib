description: "Recurrent Networks can be improved to remember long range dependencies by using whats called a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) Cell. Let's build one using just numpy! I'll go over the cell components as well as the forward and backward pass logic.\n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/LSTM_Networks\n\nPlease Subscribe! And like. And comment.
