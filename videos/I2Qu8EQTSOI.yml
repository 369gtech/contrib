recordingDate: 1531811733
description: 'More data means better models, but it also means that you''ve got to scale in order to create those models.  In this session we''ll dive into scaling deep learning with Azure, showing how you can use any framework like Tensorflow, MXNet, PyTorch, Caffe, and more and take advantage of elastic GPU enabled hardware.'
