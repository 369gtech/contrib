description: 'Transforming classic applications, which were built across multiple years, cannot be pushed to the cloud overnight.  Often times uplifting client UI will require access to backend web services and/or databases. This session will guide you through how to expose an internal web service to the cloud and have a SharePoint library webhook call the web service. This session will review the required Azure configuration settings, overall architecture required, Web Service C# code, and have the web service answer a SharePoint Webhook.'
