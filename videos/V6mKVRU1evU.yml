description: "Get the Code Here: http://goo.gl/Y3UTH\n\nWelcome to my Big O Notations tutorial. Big O notations are used to measure how well a computer algorithm scales as the amount of data involved increases. It isn't however always a measure of speed as you'll see.\n\nThis is a rough overview of Big O and I hope to simplify it rather than get into all of the complexity. I'll specifically cover the following O(1), O(N), O(N^2), O(log N) and O(N log N). Between the video and code below I hope everything is completely understandable."
