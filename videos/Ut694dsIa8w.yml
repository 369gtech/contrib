description: "Google Tech Talk\nNovember 13, 2014\nPresented by Anders Hejlsberg (more info below)\n\nABSTRACT\n\nIn this talk Anders will give an overview of TypeScript, a statically typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. TypeScript adds optional static types, classes, interfaces, and modules to JavaScript, enabling IDE productivity features such as statement completion, refactoring, and code navigation, and making it easier for teams to communicate requirements and build applications safely. The TypeScript language features an innovative structural type system that incorporates gradual typing and type inference. The TypeScript project is open-source and hosted on GitHub.\n\nSpeaker Info:\n\nAnders Hejlsberg is a Technical Fellow in the Developer Division at Microsoft Corporation and works on Microsoftâ€™s .NET and JavaScript development tools. He is the chief designer of the C# programming language and co-designer of the TypeScript programming language. Before joining Microsoft in 1996, Anders was a Principal Engineer at Borland International. As one of the first employees of Borland, he was the original author of Turbo Pascal and later worked as the Chief Architect of the Delphi product line.
