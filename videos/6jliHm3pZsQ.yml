title: 'YOW! Connected 2017 Andrew Harvey - They''re Good Dogs: Machine Learning with CoreML and Vision'
language: English
recordingDate: 1510354800
description: "At WWDC this year, Apple announced their CoreML and Vision frameworks. These allow you do easily implement machine learning models inside your app, running on the GPU on an iPhone. Suddenly a world of machine learning is possible in ways that it wasn't before.\n\nIn this talk, you'll see a real world example written in just hours which implements a freely available object classification model to find out who is a good dog. Silly as this sounds, it shows the power now at our disposal.\nWe’ll look at what you need to do to build a simple app, and then dig into some of the innards of machine learning to see what we need to do to create something really useful.\n\nUntil recently, Andrew was Chief Nerd for Zova: the Apple Design Award winning fitness app. When he's not writing founder code, Andrew is frequently found cycling, tinkering with electronics and drinking coffee.\n\nFor more information on YOW!
