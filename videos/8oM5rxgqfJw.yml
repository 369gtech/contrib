description: "Today’s amounts of collected data are showing nearly exponential growth. More than 75 percent of all collected data has been collected in the past five years. To store that data and process it within an appropriate time, you need to partition the data and parallelize the processing of reports and analytics. This session demonstrates how to quickly and easily parallelize data processing with Hazelcast and its underlying distributed data structures. By giving a few quick introductions to different terms and some short live coding sessions, the presentation takes you on a journey through distributed computing.\n\n\nAuthor:\nNoctarius ツ\nChristoph Engelbert, Hazelcast Employee, Apache Committer, Opensource Enthusiast, Ex-Ubisoftler (BlueByte) - Views are my own / not on behalf of Hazelcast! :)\nView more trainings by Noctarius ツ at https://www.parleys.com/author/noctarius-ツ\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
