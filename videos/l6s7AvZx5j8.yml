language: English
recordingDate: 1525694404
description: "Have you ever used a List of T and wondered what the T meant? Or maybe you heard the term generics but you didn't really know what that was or why it was important. Maybe you have been using generics for a while but didn't know you could create your own. Whatever the case, this video is for you. In this video, I am going to lay the foundation of what generics are and what makes them so powerful. Then, we will look at a demonstration I have set up on how you can keep your code dry, better conform to the SOLID principles, and make your life easier by implementing generics a class.\n\nSource Code: https://leadmagnets.app/?Resource=CSharpGenerics\nPatreon: https://patreon.com/IAmTimCorey\nNewsletter signup:  https://signup.iamtimcorey.com/"
