description: "\"Love at First Language\"\n\nExperienced multilingual programmers seem to have a hard time with some of JavaScript’s “weird” concepts. For me as beginner, new to any programming some years ago, this was surprising. My talk is about a late professional switch from neuroscience to frontend development and how the beginner’s angle is different - if not an advantage - to learn basic concepts of JavaScript. And it is a little love story of coding."
