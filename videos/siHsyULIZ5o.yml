For example, what checks and staging deployments should occur on commits; what approval steps are required before promotion to production; what code needs to be included in new projects and what provisioning should occur on project creation; and what policies matter around license files and security scanning.\n\nBut it’s hard to realize that vision. Typical challenges include:\n• Growing proliferation of services, meaning many delivery pipelines that can’t easily be changed as one, and many repositories with dependencies, configuration and usage practices getting dangerously out of date.\n• Bringing on new developers, due to lack of effective knowledge sharing and lack of automation\nCreating new projects without copy/paste, leading to wasted effort and inconsistency\n• Lack of visibility into the whole elephant. What is deployed where? What is at what version? What is happening across the organization? Who should be informed in the case of a production alert, and to what code does it relate?\nThe solution to these software problems is more software. These problems can best be addressed together, through [...]\n\nRead the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotochgo.com/2019/sessions/829/why-you-need-a-software-delivery-machine\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOchgo\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\n#automation #Atomist #productivity #ProgrammingLanguages\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO Conference near you!
