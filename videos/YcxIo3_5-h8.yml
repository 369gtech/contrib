See http://fitc.ca for details.\n\nOverview\nSure, you use Grunt to build your projects, but have you ever wondered how it all works? Where do those Grunt plugins come from? How are they put together? What do you do if there isn’t a plugin that meets your needs?\n\nI wrote my first Grunt plugin to solve a very specific problem but ended up learning things about npm and Grunt that have benefited all of my projects. In this talk, I’ll walk you through how I created my plugin and how you can do the same. Even if you never get that far, you’ll take away useful ideas you can apply to your existing Grunt workflow.\n\nJamie Strachan\nLead Architect, CBC\nhttps://twitter.com/jamiestrachan\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
