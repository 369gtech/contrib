title: 'DevOps For Dishwashers - Bringing grown up practices to the Internet of Things - Christopher Biggs'
recordingDate: 1506326718
description: "The Internet of Things is undeniably here. In the last year we have heard tell of of security cameras, dishwashers and even ovens roaming the internet unsupervised.\n\nAs a consultant and writer specialising in the Internet of Things, I have worked to bring my experience from 20 years in manufacturing and internet security to the IoT world. This presentation will cover the tools and techniques I use to build secure, reliable and rapidly updatable IoT devices.\n\nThe techniques covered are applicable to both the simplest embedded devices with no general-purpose OS, and more powerful devices running Linux or Windows.\n\nPart 1, architecture and coding:\n\n* Using containers (docker) in the embedded world (and simple equivalents for less capable platforms)\n* Applying Continuous Integration and automated testing to embedded devices\n\nPart 2, deployment and maintenance:\n\n* Using the open-source SaltStack platform to provision IoT devices. I introduce a framework (https://github.com/unixbigot/kevin) which has been developed for use in my IoT projects\n* Examples of using cloud frameworks for IoT management: Amazon AWS, Resin.io, Google Android Things\n\nPart 3, Monitoring, Command and Control:\n\n* Tracking your device behaviour with SaltStack and Elastic Search\n* Updating your devices in the field\n* Tips and techniques for device longevity"
