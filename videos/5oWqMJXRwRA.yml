description: "Наша группа в ФБ: https://www.facebook.com/qafest/\nНаш сайт: www.qafest.com\n\nДоклад на конференции QA Fest 2017 в Киеве.\nYou might have heard of the existence of context-driven testing and the vibrant community engaged in it. In very simple terms, context-driven testing means to look at a problem first and based on its understanding to develop a solution. The seven principles of context-driven testing are: \n1. The value of any practice depends on its context.\n2. There are good practices in context, but there are no best practices.\n3. People, working together, are the most important part of any project's context.\n4. Projects unfold over time in ways that are often not predictable.\n5. The product is a solution. If the problem isn't solved, the product doesn't work.\n6. Good software testing is a challenging intellectual process.\n7. Only through judgment and skill, exercised cooperatively throughout the entire project, are we able to do the right things at the right times to effectively test our products.\nThis session will go into the meaning of the context-driven approach and principles and tries to convince you that context-driven testing is not only a valid approach but also smoothly integrates with agile development practices.\nWe will talk about testing as a craft and the value of an engaged community of testers and how you can tap into the magic of context-driven testing to become a world-class tester."
