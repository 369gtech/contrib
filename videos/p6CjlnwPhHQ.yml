language: English
recordingDate: 1581599229
description: "What do you do when your .NET Core application doesn’t behave the way you expect? Maybe it’s slower since the last deployment or has started crashing at the worst possible times. How do you analyze the issue when your application is running in someone else’s data center on the other side of the planet? On Linux? In a container?\n\nDamian and David from the .NET team will demonstrate ways to diagnose issues in .NET Core 3.1 applications, using new APIs, command line tools, and features of Visual Studio, to gather information, analyze it, and fix root causes.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks, courses, and conferences in the following links:\nhttps://ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
