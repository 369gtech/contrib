We examine how SonarQube (with SonarLint) as well as Twistlock help to deliver software fast and in good quality. After the session you better understand Continuous Delivery concepts and tools, particularly how to inject security-related quality gates. The live demo is derived from couple of real-world success stories.\n \nMichael Hüttermann \nFrom http://huettermann.net\nPrincipal DevOps Consultant."
