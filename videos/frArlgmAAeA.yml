My Experience Leading a Kubernetes Release Team - Claire Laurence, Pivotal \n\n9 months, 3 releases, 3 roles, and countless new faces - hereâ€™s a story about how I went from a brand new community member to release lead in less than a year and what I discovered along the way. Over 9 months I dove into the Kubernetes release world and dealt with the challenges of shipping a release, the tough decisions that need to be made, and how to adapt our release plan to stay on target.     The Kubernetes release is at the core of the community. Managing an open source release requires flexibility, transparency, and radical collaboration. As the size of the contributors grows, how does the release process adapt? How are decisions made? How do we react when plans change? How did I quickly move from a shadow to the release lead role? In this talk I plan on addressing these questions and my experience leading the 1.15 release team  \n\nhttps://sched.co/UaWB"
