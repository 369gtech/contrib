description: "You've Lost That Process Feeling: Some Lessons from Resilience Engineering\n\nDavid D. Woods, Ohio State University and Adaptive Capacity Labs; Laura Nolan, Slack\n\nSoftware systems are brittle in various ways, and prone to failures. We can sometimes improve the robustness of our software systems, but true resilience always requires human involvement: people are the only agents that can detect, analyze, and fix novel problems.\n\nBut this is not easy in practice. Woods' Theorem states that as the complexity of a system increases, the accuracy of any single agent's own model of that system—their 'process feel'—decreases rapidly. This matters, because we work in teams, and a sustainable on-call rotation requires several people.\n\nThis talk brings a researcher and a practitioner together to discuss some Resilience Engineering concepts as they apply to SRE, with a particular focus on how teams can systematically approach sharing experiences about anomalies in their systems and create ongoing learning from 'weak signals' as well as major incidents.\n\nView the full SREcon21 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon21/program"
