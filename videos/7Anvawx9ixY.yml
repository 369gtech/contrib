description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Chicago 2020. #GOTOcon #GOTOchgo\nhttp://gotochgo.com\n\nMike Amundsen - The (API) uncle you wish you had — the ultimate expert\n\nABSTRACT\nAs APIs are adopted in more and more organizations, the need for successful API design and implementation becomes more pressing. Companies that adopt a single API definition format (OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, Schema Definition Language, Protobuff, etc.) are likely to find their options limited as their API ecosystem grows and matures over time.\nIn order to avoid forcing the entire company to adopt a single API style or format, no matter the requirements of providers and consumers, we need a unified API design process. One that doesn't pre-determine implementation details such as REST, GraphQL, gRPC, and others. Based on materials in Amundsen's book \"Design and Build Great Web APIs\", this talk describes a simple, repeatable process for API designers to capture and document design details in a way that allows API developers to make their own decisions on which API style best fits the needs of the company and the consumer.\nWhether you are responsible for API architecture, design, implementation, or support [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n02:07 A story of API design & governance\n04:17 The challenge of HTTP-centric API design\n06:34 A unified method for API design\n09:12 Examples/demo\n15:10 A unified method for API design continued\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotochgo.com/2020/sessions/1270/graphql-grpc-and-rest-oh-my-a-method-for-unified-api-design\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#APIs #GraphQL #gRPC #REST #RESTapis #APIDesign #OpenAPI #AsyncAPI #Protobuff\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
