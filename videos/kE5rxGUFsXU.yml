description: 'You''re probably familiar with the buzz around Docker and other popular container solutions. Advocates for these tools make it seem like using containers is the only way to go nowadays. So should we throw away everything we learned about Continuous Delivery in the past 10 years for a hype that''s been around for just a few years? Of course not. This session shares experiences with a practical approach to Continuous Delivery and DevOps in 10 clear, down-to-earth steps. The result is a setup that is scalable, resilient and maintainable, yet without the use of popular container solutions like Docker or Mesos. Key concepts are automated provisioning and deployments, DevOps, continuous testing, microservices, open source, cloud services and automated scaling.'
