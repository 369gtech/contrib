description: 'Last year at Devoxx UK a couple of attendees grabbed the organisers and explained their vision: to have a Devoxx type event in their own backyard in the south of Switzerland. As they pointed out, not every developer gets the chance to travel internationally to a conference and learn great things. Fast forward 9 months and they were organising a Voxxed Days event in Ticino, where 300 local developers came to learn about the latest emerging technologies and methodologies. Join Federico and Celestino and hear about their efforts to bring awesome tech coolness to the beautiful city of Lugano, how they built an open source ticketing system, their many sleepless nights, how they gained sponsorship from local and international companies, and how the community around them will benefit. You might also hear that they loved it so much, their doing the same now in Zurich too.'
