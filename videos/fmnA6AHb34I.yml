In 2015 alone, open source projects have revealed lynchpin technologies that have changed the game for vendors and users like never before to accelerate innovation and upend traditional business models. Coincidence? I think not – at IBM, we understand that this world needs to be Open by design. In his talk, Dr. Angel Diaz provides a retrospective on the evolution of open source from the “old ways” in the early years to today’s new model of “code, community and culture” which brings together users and developers to accelerate innovation. This is a celebration of the open source advancements of the first half of 2015, specifically with an eye towards the blending of key open source projects like OpenStack, Cloud Foundry and Docker to deliver integrated open source solutions. Momentum has only just begun however so buckle up for a preview of new open source projects on deck like Node.js and Open Data Platform as well as a significant announcement from IBM for the open source community.\n\nThis keynote sponsored by IBM.\n\nAbout Angel Diaz:\nAlways on the move, Dr. Angel Diaz is IBM’s VP of cloud technology and architecture.
