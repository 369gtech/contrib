description: "Since their introduction, Applicative and its sidekick Alternative have become ubiquitous and beloved type classes in Haskell and similar languages such as Purescript. By contrast, their contravariant counterparts are relatively unknown. These contravariant structures are useful, and their time has come!\n\nIn this talk, we will learn about Contravariant, and its subclasses Divisible and Decidable. How do they work? How do they relate to the classes we know? Are they useful? For what? This talks aims to demystify these classes in an approachable way, by demonstrating their use with practical motivating examples.\n\nGeorge is an enthusiastic programmer working at the Queensland Functional Programming Lab within Data61/CSIRO. George loves working with and speaking about Functional Programming, usually in Haskell. George is also a co-organiser of the Brisbane Functional Programming Group, and a member of the Haskell.org committee.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
