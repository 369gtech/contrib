description: 'In this talk, Phil and Michael will talk about how Docker was extended from x86 Linux to Windows, ARM and IBMâ€™s z Systems mainframe and Power platforms. They will cover the work and architecture that makes it possible to run Docker on different CPU architectures and operating systems; How porting Docker to a new OS is different from porting it to new hardware; What it means for a Docker image to be multi-arch (and how are multi-arch images built and maintained); How does Docker correctly deploy and schedule apps on heterogeneous swarms. Phil and Michael will also demo some of the new features that let Docker Enterprise Edition manage swarms with both x86 Linux and Windows nodes as well as mainframes.'
