description: "Over the past year Uber has created tooling to gather mobile performance data from the field. This includes timing various in-app transitions, gathering metrics like frame rate, CPU, and memory usage, as well as automatically tracing the execution time of function calls in production.\n\nWe are now open-sourcing this set of tools as the PerfSDK. Come check out its capabilities and how you can use it in your own iOS and Android applications.\n\n Marcello Albano\nI've been working on Android since 2010. At Uber I'm a Senior Software Engineer on the Mobile Performance team, building tools and instrumentation to surface and diagnose various performance issues. Recently I created the Android version of the PerformanceSDK: our in-house mobile performance tracing tool. Prior to Uber I worked at Runtastic, 3CX and sold my own app Lazydroid."
