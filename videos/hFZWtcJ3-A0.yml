Proximal networking, in which the Cloud  is accessed only when it makes sense and only by one member of the  network, opens up a vast array of new possibilities for developers and  brands alike.\n\n\nAuthors:\nBrian Vogelsang\n-0\nView more trainings by Brian Vogelsang at https://www.parleys.com/author/brian-vogelsang\n\nAmber Branwell\n-0\nView more trainings by Amber Branwell at https://www.parleys.com/author/amber-branwell\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
