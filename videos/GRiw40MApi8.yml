description: "The new lambda language features in Java SE 8 are catalysts for new APIs that would previously have been impractical or impossible. The Streams API, which enables bulk operations on collections and other aggregates, sequentially or in parallel, is one such example that is the centerpiece of the Java SE 8 libraries. This session, primarily via the IDE and Java tooling, examines the Stream API, architecture, and implementation in detail so that developers can learn how to use the API, get good performance and scalability, and apply the same design techniques to their own APIs.\n\n\nAuthor:\nPaul Sandoz\nA reformed RESTerfarian who previously co-led JAX-RS and led the implementation Jersey, who moved up into the clouds with the industrious bees of CloudBees, and then boomeranged back to Oracle and deep down into the Java stack.\n\nBlog: http://earthly-powers.blogspot.co.uk/\nView more trainings by Paul Sandoz at https://www.parleys.com/author/paul-sandoz-1\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
