title: 'ASP.NET Core for Angular, React, and Knockout developers - Steve Sanderson'
recordingDate: 1499244379
description: "ASP.NET Core strives to be the best server-side web platform for developers building rich Single Page Apps (SPAs) with frameworks such as Angular, React, and others.\n\nIn this talk, I’ll demonstrate how you can:\n\n   - Seamlessly integrate your server-side code with your client-side code\n   - Code faster: Have your development-time server automatically rebuild TypeScript/LESS/etc in realtime as you edit code, and use Hot Module Replacement (HMR) to sync those updates into your pages instantly without reloading or losing state\n   - Boost performance and SEO: Enable server-side prerendering of your Angular4/React components, and optimise the delivery of JavaScript/CSS to the browser\n   - Use advanced client-side debugging features thanks to tie-ins with Redux and Webpack\n   - Use features from any NPM package"
