title: 'O''Reilly Webcast: Developing Effective OCUnit and UI Automation Testing for iOS'
language: English
recordingDate: 1294961527
description: "The iPhone is a powerful development platform, but can be a difficult one to develop effective testing methodologies for. The OCUnit framework and the UIAutomation framework can allow developers to create unit tests with code coverage, and user interface level testing suites, but they can be extremely tricky to use and are not well documented by Apple.\n\nIn this one hour screencast, you learn how to create an OCUnit project in XCode, and then write and debug OCUnit test cases. You find out what the limitations of OCUnit are, and how some of them can be mitigated with testing using the Instruments tool and the UI Automation framework."
