It's the best way for understanding your process and explain something for your customers. What do you prefer: use an existing platform or build yours? You'd better build yours!\n\nI'm going to tell about advantages of making a personal dashboard due to python jointly with Plotly / Bokeh. In speech ETL process will be observed as a process for supporting relevance of data and how python could be involved on it. As a result you will have lots of arguments for making your platform and you will know which skills could be pumped during the work. Plenty of examples of right statistical visualization are going to be passed through the report for afters.\n\nPresentation: https://github.com/NameArtem/papers/(FINAL)_ARGUMENTS \n\nVideo Partner â€“ Wargaming (https://wargaming.com/ru/)"
