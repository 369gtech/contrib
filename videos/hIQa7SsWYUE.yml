recordingDate: 1625485237
description: "There is a lot of cool, and usable new features being added to C#. However, way too many of us are too busy building stuff, and fixing/creating bugs, to have the time to sit down and look take it all in. So why not let Chris Klug walk you through his top 10 new features that have been added in C# version 6 to 9.\n\nSure, C# has gotten a LOT more than 10 new things since version 6. But if you are a busy developer, like most of us are, getting an introduction to the top 10 ones in just an hour, could be a great start.\n\nIn this talk, Chris will show, and explain, his personal top 10 favorite features that have been added to C# in the last few years. Everything from awesome time savers and stability contributors, to syntax changes that allow your code to be denser and/or easier to read."
