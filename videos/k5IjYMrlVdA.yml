title: 'YOW! 2013 Michael T. Nygard - Five Years of DevOps: Where are we Now?'
language: English
recordingDate: 1513954098
description: "It has been five years since Patrick Debois coined the term DevOps to describe a way of working together to deliver systems. In that time, we have rediscovered some gems from the past and we have invented new techniques and tools. In this session, we will take a look at what’s new in the world of DevOps, what’s old-but-good, and where we still need to advance.\n\nMichael Nygard strives to raise the bar and ease the pain for developers across the country. Highly-available, highly-scalable commerce systems are his forte. Michael has written and co-authored several books, including “97 Things Every Software Architect Should Know” and the best seller “Release It!”, a book about building software that survives the real world.\n\nFor more on YOW!
