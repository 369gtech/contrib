description: "Speaker: Ishara Karunarathna\n\nIn API Craft Singapore’s July meetup, you will learn:\n- Service mesh approaches to managing microservices architecture\n- How service meshes and API management need to co-exist\n- How to integrate API management with Istio service mesh\n- How to securely expose APIs from the Istio\n- A live example demo\n\nIn a world of disaggregated API-based architectures, developers are increasingly adopting microservices — and Service Mesh is being used to control many service-to-service communications. But securely communicating and governing between such services is becoming a key challenge. To make matters more complicated, multiple implementations of service meshes exist today, and none of them address the concern of how the exploding number of APIs can be exposed in a controlled and secure manner to their API consumers.\nIn this presentation, WSO2’s Senior Technical Lead, Ishara Karunarathna, will discuss how to augment service mesh functionality with API management capabilities, so you can create an end-to-end solution for your entire business functionality — from microservices, to APIs, to end-user applications.\n\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/API-Craft-Singapore/events/263087209/\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/qs8J/"
