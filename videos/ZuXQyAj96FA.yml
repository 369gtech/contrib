description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nKata Containers + Cloud-Hypervisor: Virtualization for Cloud Native - Samuel Ortiz, Intel \n\nAt KubeCon NA 2017, the speakers introduced the Kata Containers project to the public for the first time. After two years of development and community collaboration, we have made containers running in virtualized sandboxes a commodity. On the other hand, virtualization has become more lightweight and container-friendly.  At the beginning of 2020, Kata project is kicking off the 2.0 dev-cycle, and the idea behind it is “virtualization for Cloud Native”. The new open-source cloud-hypervisor will be a cornerstone for the goal -- not only by helping Cloud-Native infrastructures run better with hardware-virtualized isolation but also by pushing the virtualization tech forward: - Share resources across sandboxes but keep the security boundary clear. - Provision resources to sandboxes on-demand and promptly. - The collaboration between host user-space tool, VMM, and the guest kernel.\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zej5"
