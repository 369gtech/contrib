The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nSIG Release - Deep Dive: Release Engineering Subproject - Stephen Augustus, VMware & Hannes Hörl, Pivotal \n\nThe Kubernetes SIG Release is chartered with producing project releases on a reliable schedule. A key component of this is release automation and build tooling. The process/procedures and tools used to create and maintain Kubernetes release artifacts are the responsibility of SIG Release’s recently created Release Engineering subproject. In the early days of the project this code was heavily dependent on a Google presence and is one of (if not _the_) final remnants of that historical connection to the project’s origination. As SIG Release work to shift these last pieces into a community led process and community maintained code, we need your assistance. This deep dive will present an overview of the major moving pieces in the release pipeline, detail the code/process enhancements and improvements currently underway, and share opportunities where you can join in the Release Engineering subproject to assist in making its code more robust and community sustainable. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Uaff"
