description: "In Search of an Understandable Consensus Algorithm\n\nDiego Ongaro and John Ousterhout, Stanford University\n\nRaft is a consensus algorithm for managing a replicated log. It produces a result equivalent to (multi-)Paxos, and it is as efficient as Paxos, but its structure is different from Paxos; this makes Raft more understandable than Paxos and also provides a better foundation for building practical systems. In order to enhance understandability, Raft separates the key elements of consensus, such as leader election, log replication, and safety, and it enforces a stronger degree of coherency to reduce the number of states that must be considered. Results from a user study demonstrate that Raft is easier for students to learn than Paxos. Raft also includes a new mechanism for changing the cluster membership, which uses overlapping majorities to guarantee safety.\n\nView the full USENIX ATC '14 Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc14/technical-sessions"
