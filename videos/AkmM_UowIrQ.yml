description: "Strata Rx brings together experts and innovators in data science and healthcare, crossing traditional industry boundaries and uncovering insights on the emerging big data and analytic approaches that can help solve some of healthcare's biggest challenges. \n\nIn this free online conference we will discuss how Microsoft Research has developed a new version of the Linear Mixed Model algorithm that is not only computationally inexpensive, but also is better at finding the true signals that account statistically for the diversity of people in data sets used to identify \"complex traits\".\n\nYou will see how using crowd-sourcing and distributed distribution models can create a massive phenotypic data set of the human condition to compare to genetic data sets so we can better understand what an individual genome represents. \n\nWe will also discuss the privacy implications of personalized medicine: potential pit-falls and policy decisions that we're likely to face as our analytics improve. \n\nHosted by Strata Rx co-chair Julie Steele\n\nJulie Steele is an editor at O'Reilly Media interested in connecting people and ideas.
