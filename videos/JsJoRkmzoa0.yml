description: "Network Machinery: A United-Front for Network Troubleshooting with CRDs - Adel Zaalouk, SAP  \n\nThe current state of network troubleshooting in Kubernetes is complicated. The knowledge of how to troubleshoot Kubernetes networking is scattered all over the place either in the heads of highly skilled network crafts-men or as a tool that has its own learning curve and usually forged at a time of disaster in a fire-and-forget fashion.  The goal of this talk is to propose and introduce a rather simpler way of pooling this common knowledge and tooling together into a well-defined, consistent and community-accepted set of resources that are available to the average Kubernetes user. These set of resources can be divided in NetworkingPerformanceTest, NetworkingDebuggingTest, NetworkSimulationTest all under the NetworkMachinery group. Finally, the resources might utilize common network knowledge and even some dark-art tooling (e.g. OpenFlow, OVS, OVN) to provide more insight on the network \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPZw"
