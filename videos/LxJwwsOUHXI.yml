description: 'What if you could look at the source code behind any visualization, understand how it works, run it to check the results using the latest data and modify the parameters to explore different aspects of the data? I this talk, I will show how we used F# and functional programming to develop a new browser-based data visualization environment. I will show two fun projects that we created looking at the history of Olympic games and testing what people know about the UK government spending. Expect to learn about fun data science and programming challenges we encountered along the way!'
