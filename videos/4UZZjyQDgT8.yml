description: "Domain-Driven Design Europe 2016 - Brussels, January 27-29 2016\nhttp://dddeurope.com - https://twitter.com/ddd_eu\nThe software development industry faces peril as entire teams are assigned to patch systems on a daily basis to keep them operational. Forget about DDD for a moment. What are some of the most insidious problems with software development today? Why do the same problems continue to happen across a vast array of corporate and software development cultures? After identifying the problems, how can DDD help teams overcome them? And, using DDD, what is a powerful approach to modeling your core domain while applying microservices? The current state of the industry incites a lot of questions, and you really should care about the answers."
