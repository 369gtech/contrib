description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nFive Great Ways to Lose Data on Kubernetes (And How to Avoid Them) - Robert Hodges, Altinity LTD \n\nDatabases and stateful apps are gravitating rapidly to Kubernetes, so the sorrows of accidental data loss cannot be far behind. As long-time database engineers and authors of the ClickHouse Kubernetes operator, our team has seen lots of imaginative ways to lose data. We also learned how to prevent them.  The talk starts with standard high availability/disaster recovery models used in DBMS and demonstrates that classic ways to lose data are still alive and well on Kubernetes. We'll then pivot to Kubernetes-specific disasters-in-waiting, such as the PV that wasn't, affinity afflictions, and the dreaded fat fingers of fate. The talk will help instill a healthy sense of paranoia and give listeners tools to ensure their experiences with cloud-native data will be happy ones.\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zet6"
