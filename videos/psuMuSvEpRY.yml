description: "Recording brought to you by American Express https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs\nThere's plenty out there about how to make Kotlin work well with Java - but what about the reverse? Do you want to appeal more to your Kotlin customers whilst maintaining an idiomatic experience for your Java customers? This session will cover 10(ish) tips and tricks you can apply to your Java library to make it more Kotlin-friendly without sacrificing usability for your Java customers. We'll look at case-studies of real open-source Java libraries and show you techniques you can apply to make your library play nicely within the Kotlin ecosystem.\n\nAbout the Presenter: \nKyle Thomson is a senior engineer who spent a decade writing large-scale trading applications for banks before joining the AWS SDK team. He has a passion for open source and is currently a core maintainer for several of the open-sourced AWS tools. The majority of Kyle’s experience is in JVM languages (Java, Scala, Kotlin) but he’s also written enterprise software in Python, Perl, Objective-C and Ruby."
