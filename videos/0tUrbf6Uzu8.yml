description: 'A deep understanding of Clojure, how it executes, and the runtime it sits on is a whole lot of work to acquire. But there''s a shortcut. Doing performance work forces you to peel apart the layers of abstraction your software sits on, and understand what really goes on. This is an exploration of war stories from performance tuning a production Clojure application, with an eye towards surprising lessons about Clojure and the runtime it executes on: the JVM.'
