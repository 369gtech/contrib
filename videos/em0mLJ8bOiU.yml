description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nIntro + Deep Dive: Specialized Network Protocols for IoT+Edge with Kubernetes - Steven Wong, VMware & Dejan Bosanac, Red Hat  \n\nThis session will survey communication protocols and technologies used in the edge and IoT space. These use cases can call for specialized protocols and transports: -publish subscribe, multicast -protocols tolerant of intermittent connectivity -Protocols popular in industry verticals (vehicle bus, industrial automation, building automation) In some cases, support exists now for use with Kubernetes. If not, device gateways and protocol converters might be an option. Agenda: -survey of protocols and transport standards for IoT and edge -Intro to how a device gateway or protocol converter works -Intro to extending Kubernetes with CRDs to manage new device types -Deep Dive / Futures: Could the service mesh concept be extended beyond TCP, HTTP(s)? -Demonstration: Kubernetes management of an edge application using a specialized protocol -Demonstration: Use a device gateway with Kubernetes \n\nhttps://sched.co/UakM"
