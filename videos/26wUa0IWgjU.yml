description: "Scaling Agility Across the Enterprise\nWhilst agile frameworks are excellent at encouraging and tracking velocity for individual projects, when you are running 20+ projects at the same time these can sometimes be at the consequence of the bigger picture. Our discussion, presents a number of techniques that can be used to observe trends and ensure both technical & project strategies are achieved across the enterprise, which complement projects remaining agile. You can study any number of Agile practices. Scrum, DSDM, XP, Kanban, Lean, TDD, Pair Programming, Continuous Delivery..... we'll let you know what's worked in the enterprise, what hasn't and why so hopefully you can avoid some of the many pitfalls along the path to sustained Agility, with some humble suggestions in tow."
