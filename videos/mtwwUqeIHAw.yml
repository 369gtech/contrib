Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nThanos: Easier Than Ever to Scale Prometheus and Make It Highly Available - Giedrius Statkevičius, Vinted & Prem Saraswat; Red Hat\n\nPrometheus is a leading CNCF Graduated project that provides a solution for all things metrics. However, it lacks scalability and high availability features. Thanos turbocharges Prometheus by adding those features while keeping storage and maintenance costs low. In the first part of the session, you will discover how to leverage Thanos in your organization just as many other companies have already done . You will learn enough to continue on your journey toward deploying Thanos in Kubernetes or any other cloud native environment. In the deep dive, you will find out what we have been working on recently to make everything even better - deleting series from blocks, caching queries with the query frontend, making the ruler scalable and stateless, optimizing the compaction of very large blocks, streamlining the receiver, and more!"
