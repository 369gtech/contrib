description: "The poetic collision of human desires and cutting-edge technology illustrate our present age with synthetic harmony and voltaic friction. However, as digital design and artificial intelligence rush into a thrilling future, the time span of our attention and the quality of our experience decreases.\n\nIn this talk Christian Mio Loclair, creative director at studio Waltz Binaire, invites you on an interdisciplinary and visually stunning journey through code experiments, robot dancing, machine learning to answer the question “WHY?”\n\nCan AI be a generator for sustainable questions and meaningful discussions? Can we read information and understand knowledge that was never made for us? Can we use emerging technologies as a mirror to human nature and how do we create accessible narrations for people to participate and understand?\n\nChristian Mio Loclair\nwaltzbinaire.com\nhttps://twitter.com/WaltzBinaire\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttps://fitc.ca/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=video-description\n\nSave 10% off any FITC event with discount code 'youtube'.\nSee our upcoming events at https://fitc.ca/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=video-description"
