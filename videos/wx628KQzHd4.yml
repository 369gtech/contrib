title: 'Building Wix''s most starred open source - Shalom Yerushalmy'
recordingDate: 1532585731
description: "Wix is a major contributor to the React Native community, and building and maintaining a few of its major open source projects requires from us to have the best CI and testing environment.\n\nBuilding, testing and publishing complex React Native projects requires mixing many technologies, from building Java/objC/JS, running and managing tests on iOS Simulators and Android Emulators.\n\nWe evaluated 3 types of solutions, and decided to go with Jenkins with MacStadium."
