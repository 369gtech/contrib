description: "Recorded at SpringOne Platform 2016.\nSpeaker: Dieter Hubau, Ordina JWorks\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/writing-your-own-spring-boot-starter\n\nAnyone who is actively using Spring must have heard of Spring Boot by now. It is the current de facto standard tool to start with a new Spring project and will become even more prevalent over the coming years. Next to an easy to use interface at start.spring.io and very good documentation, there are a ton of so called Spring Boot Starters which a developer can use to jumpstart their development. While the auto-configuration and starters often seem to be magically endowed creatures originating from the deepest regions of the forest moon of Endor... there are not. In fact, anyone can write his or her own Spring Boot Starter. During the presentation, I will explain the inner workings of a Spring Boot Starter project and go over the necessary code for creating our own. I will use my recently developed starter for integrating Spring Social with a Redis backed datastore. At the end of the session, the audience will know that the Spring Boot autoconfiguration and starter projects are not magical unicorns, but easy to understand components in the Spring Boot ecosystem. They will also learn how to create their own Spring Boot Starter project and hopefully, they will be inclined to become proactively involved in the Spring Boot project."
