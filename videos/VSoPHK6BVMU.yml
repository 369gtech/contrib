description: "Deep Dive: SAFE BoF- Jeyappragash Jeyakeerthi, padme.io & Dan Shaw, danshaw, LLC \n\nThe charter of the working group is to reduce risk that applications expose end user data or allow other unintended access. Distributed deployments across heterogeneous infrastructure are increasingly common for cloud native applications. The working group sees common need patterns in cloud-native application architecture to improve the security of the systems. Without common ways to programatically ensure consistent policy, it is increasingly difficult to evaluate system architecture security at scale. We propose that the creation of open source libraries that enable interoperability across software and providers will enable the adoption of common protocols for access control. This will in turn accelerate the adoption of cloud-native application development models, as well as streamline operations for both cloud and traditional infrastructure. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/GrdR"
