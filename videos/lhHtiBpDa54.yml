description: "TALK: A Case Study in LASP and Distribution at Scale\n\nSpeaker: Christopher Meiklejohn, Ph.D. student at the Universit√© catholique de Louvain in Belgium. \n\nChristopher Meiklejohn loves distributed systems and programming languages. Previously, Christopher worked at Basho Technologies, Inc. on the distributed key-value store, Riak. Christopher develops a programming language for distributed computation, called Lasp. \n\nLasp is The Missing Part of Erlang Distribution. It is a suite of libraries aimed at providing a comprehensive programming system for planetary scale of Elixir and Erlang applications. This is achieved through a set of components that have been designed to work together to provide a comprehensive solution for future Elixir and Erlang applications: large-scale, and geo-distributed. These components, provided as libraries, provide a cohesive solution, that can be used independently; each library is focused on solving a particular problem, composes easily with the other, and provides developer support for easing the development of these applications.\n\nIn his talk, Chris Meiklejohn will walk us through a case study where Lasp is applied in distributed, large scale systems. \n\n\nChristopher Meiklejohn: https://twitter.com/cmeik\n\nLondon Erlang User Group: https://www.meetup.com/erlangusergroup/\n\nErlang Solutions*: https://www.erlang-solutions.com/ \n*London Erlang User Group sponsors"
