description: "Strategies to \"Kubernetify\" Legacy Applications - Sai Vennam, IBM \n\nMicroservice-based architectures have seen large-scale adoption and have become the industry standard for developing cloud-native applications. This growth is supplemented by key technologies like Docker, Kubernetes, Istio and many more.    When modernizing legacy apps, migrating everything to a cloud-native architecture in a \"Big Bang\" approach is not feasible as it can be time consuming and prone to failure. In this talk, I'll outline key strategies to modernize legacy applications without sacrificing agility, quality and high-availability. In addition, I'll walk through a modernization path with a sample app. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPXo"
