title: 'Webinar: Queues with RabbitMQ - Lorna Mitchell'
language: English
recordingDate: 1507114688
description: 'Queues are a great addition to any application that has some tasks that need processing asynchronously.  This could be sending a confirmation email, resizing an avatar, or recalculating a running total of some kind; in all those cases it would be cool to send the response back to the user and then sort out that task later. This session looks at how to use a RabbitMQ job queue in your application.  It also looks at how to design elegant and robust long-running workers that will consume the jobs from the queue and process them.  This session is ideal for technical leads, developers and architects alike.'
