title: 'ColdFront16 • Soledad Penadés: Servo - a browser engine for the 21st century'
recordingDate: 1474257954
description: 'Introducing Servo. Written in a new language, Rust, Servo is a browser developed with efficiency, performance and safety in mind. In this talk we’ll look at how Servo is addressing these architectural and environmental changes, and most crucially, what this means for browse vendors, web developers and users. We’ll also look at ways in which other browsers and projects can benefit from our work on Servo and how we’ve developed an extremely active community of contributors in just a few years time.'
