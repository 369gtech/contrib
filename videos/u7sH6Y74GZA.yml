title: 'Security Holes in Git - Edward Thomson'
recordingDate: 1535367288
description: "Git is the most widely used version control system in the world, and manages some of the most critical software projects, including the Linux kernel and the Windows operating system. With so many software projects relying upon it, a security vulnerability in Git could be very problematic.\nThankfully, none of Git's security vulnerabilities have been able to be widely exploited. Still, these vulnerabilities are a fascinating look at how Git could have been exploited.\n\nIn this session, Edward Thomson will analyze a few of Git's more severe security vulnerabilities. He'll explain what the security vulnerability is and show an actual exploit. He'll also explain the fixes involved and how these issues are often more subtle than they immediately appear. Finally, he'll show how the entire developer tools community works together to collaborate on security to keep us all safe."
