description: "Speaker: Ankita Gupta, Software Engineer, honestbee\n\nAs organisations get bigger, handling large application(s) gets harder - long release and test cycles, higher chances of a small change affecting other parts of the system. Micro-services solve some of these problems, albeit with their own set of challenges. Apache Kafka allows setting up event-driven architectures, wherein the concern of each service can be cleanly separated, and communication among services can happen asynchronously. The transition form a large rails application to smaller applications can be made more seamless with a few easy steps. I will be elaborating steps developers can take to make this process easier.\n\nSpeaker's Bio\n\nAnkita is working as a full-stack software engineer at honestbee. In her free time, she works on her non-profit project Jugnuu, a low-cost, mobile-based English language solution for children.\n\nEvent Page: http://www.reddotrubyconf.com/\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/8HYL/"
