title: 'Dennie Declercq - Autism in Tech'
language: English
recordingDate: 1619688456
description: "\"Are all software developers the same? Do all software developers make the same choices? Or are some of them having more worries or just think uniquely? Yes! of course. There is a group of software developers who are autistic. It can be people with an ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) diagnosis. But there also a lot of people with autism missing an official diagnose. Some people are just fighting more than others for getting things done.\n\nIn this talk, I cover how the tech world is for me, as a person with autism. I am in tech for +10 years. In fact, sometimes I feel differences between me and other people in tech. Besides my tech role in life, I was responsible for a selfâ€“support group of people with autism for a long time. I am still active in the self-support group but handed the responsibility for focusing more on my nonprofit DDSoft.\n\nOf course, I am not only telling about myself. I cover also lessons learned from other people with autism in tech. I talk about unique thoughts, strict decisions, and anxiety for changes like updating an environment or trying to complete new classes can be hard for people like me.  And of course, I tell you about 'autistic experiences, needs and solutions' during current times of pandemic.\n\nFasten your seatbelt and have a flight into the world of autism in tech.\""
