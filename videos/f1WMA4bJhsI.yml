title: 'Generic Programming in Go. Vladimir Vivien'
recordingDate: 1597641966
description: 'Go detractors usually point to its lack of generics as a reason for not adopting the language. Starting in 2019, however, the Go community rallied around a new proposal to introduce generics in Go. This proposal has culminated in the release of the experimental implementation of the latest proposal. In this session, speaker Vladimir Vivien will explore programming using generic constructs in Go and why this approach to programming is important.'
