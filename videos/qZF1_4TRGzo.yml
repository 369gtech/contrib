description: "In this episode of Coffee with a Googler, we meet with Ken Hoetmer, one of the first ever users of Google's Maps API, and now a product manager for the Google Maps Services. We talk about how Maps development has matured, and how intelligence in geo data is key. We discuss APIs such as those for predicting travel times between locations based on historic trends, and how knowledge of roads can help improve navigation through 'snapping' from noisy GPS signals to movement on real roads. Join us to learn all about these services from a foremost expert in using and designing them.\n\nGoogle Developers Medium page: https://goo.gl/egTyEv\n\nWatch more episodes of Coffee with a Googler here: \nhttps://goo.gl/5l123N"
