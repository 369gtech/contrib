description: "If you're attending NDC you probably think you know what a foreach loop does - it iterates over a collection, right?\n\n\nWell... yes.\n\nBUT do you know how? Do you know what the C# compiler does when you write a foreach loop? What about a lambda expression? Or the re-entrant magic that is a yield return statement?\nIn this session we'll dive into Roslyn, the C# compiler, and learn about lowering and how it helps the compiler do its job, and what it does to your code. In the process you'll gain the skills to identify some of the common performance pitfalls of .NET, as well as just get a deeper understanding of what the code you write really does.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks, courses, and conferences in the following links:\nhttps://ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
