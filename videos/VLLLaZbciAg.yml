description: "I laugh at people that tell me that Java is slow, heavyweight and cumbersome. Maybe it was true when we had EJB2. I will prove to you that we can develop Enterprise Applications with just a few lines of code that can run in a Raspberry PI. If it runs in a PI, I think we can safely say it would run anywhere! To be able to do it, I'm going to use a new platform called Microprofile.\n\nMicroprofile optimizes Enterprise Java for a Microservices Architecture and delivers application portability across multiple runtimes. You can use a subset of the Java EE specifications to develop Microprofile applications, with JAX-RS, CDI, and JSON-P and later evolve it with Config, JWTs, Fault Tolerance, Metrics, Health, OpenAPI and Tracing. Join me for this live coding session and help me spread the word that Java is actually great for the Enterprise.\n\nRoberto Cortez is a passionate Java Developer with more than 10 years of experience. He is involved within the Open Source Community to help other individuals spread the knowledge about Java technologies. He is a regular speaker at conferences like JavaOne, Devoxx, Devnexus, JFokus and others. He leads the Coimbra JUG and founded the JNation Conference in Portugal. When he is not working, he hangs out with friends, play computer games and spends time with family."
