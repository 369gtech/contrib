description: "Talk recording from AmsterdamJS December 2018 Meetup https://www.meetup.com/AmsterdamJS/events/255511327/\n\n10 million Bluetooth devices ship every day, and that figure is rising. Regarded as one of the key, enabling technologies of the IoT, Bluetooth is everywhere and in the summer of 2017, a new Bluetooth technology, Bluetooth mesh networking was released. Bluetooth mesh is used in enterprise and industrial IoT systems and in these environments, web technologies and cloud-based architectures are king.\n\nIn this session, we'll review key Bluetooth concepts and capabilities and the Web Bluetooth APIs which let you exploit them. There may even be demos!\n\nAbout Martin\n\nMartin Woolley is an industry veteran with over 30 years' experience working with computers large, small and ….. getting smaller. He still has a Sinclair ZX81 somewhere. He was a part of the BBC micro:bit team and designed the micro:bit's Bluetooth profile."
