You keep going down the rabbit hole and don’t know how to make that ride comfortable. This no-slide and code-only session will explain how a Java application can be deployed in a Kubernetes cluster. Specifically, it will explain the following:\n\nPackage the application as Docker image\nCreate Kubernetes manifests\nCreate Helm charts and hosted in a repository\nTest in a local environment\nDebug pod using IntelliJ\nInstall Istio service mesh\nDistributed tracing across microservices\nMetrics using Prometheus/Grafana\nSetup deployment pipeline\nMigrate application from a dev to prod in Cloud\nChange application, show Canary and A/B\n\nArun Gupta \nFrom Amazon\nArun Gupta is a Principal Technologist at Amazon Web Services.
