title: 'SREcon19 Asia/Pacific - Practical Instrumentation for Observability'
language: English
recordingDate: 1563562531
description: "Gabe Krabbe, Google\n\nPrevious talks such as \"Service Monitoring Manualâ€”2018 Edition\" (SREcon18 Asia/Australia) have made the points around asking the right questions, knowing the audience, and the idea of \"observability\" of a service.\nThis 20-minute talk intends to fill in some of the gap between \"you need good SLIs\" and \"the code increments a counter\": what exactly should be gathered, for which purpose? There will be concrete examples for good data to gather and export, so that Prometheus, Nagios, Opencensus and their friends and relatives provide useful information instead of distracting noise and misleading lies.\n\nView the full SREcon19 Asia/Pacific program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon19asia/program.\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
