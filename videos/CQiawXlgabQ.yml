description: "Grafana Loki: Like Prometheus, But for logs. - Tom Wilkie, Grafana Labs \n\nLoki is a horizontally-scalable, highly-available log aggregation system inspired by Prometheus. It is designed to be cost effective and easy to operate, as it does not index the contents of the logs, but rather labels for each log stream.    Loki initially targets Kubernetes logging, using Prometheus service discovery to gather labels for log streams. As such, Loki enables you to easily switch between metrics and logs, streamlining the incident response process - a workflow we have built into the latest version of Grafana.    In this talk we will discuss the motivation behind Loki, its design and architecture, and what the future holds. Its early days after the launch at KubeCon Seattle, but so far the response to the project has been overwhelming, with more the 4.5k GitHub stars and over 12hrs at the top spot on Hacker News. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPbj"
