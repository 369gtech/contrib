description: "lecture by Tomasz Stachlewski\n\nIs it possible to create a fully scalable, highly available application and deploy it into the Cloud in only one hour? We will find out during a real-time coding session. During one hour we will dive deep into the Cloud and create an application without using a single server. We will also create microservices, databases and Artificial Intelligence services for the text-to-speech and image analysis functionality of our application."
