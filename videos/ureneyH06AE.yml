All of them are using a *read-only root file system* and so called *transactional / atomic updates* to update a system safely - without having to worry that a broken update could leave your system in some undefined state.\n\nThis talk will focus on how to use *btrfs*' snapshot feature to implement such a transactional system and explain where the pitfalls of implementing such a system compared to a traditional read-write system are.\n\nIgnaz Forster\n\nhttps://cfp.all-systems-go.io/ASG2019/talk/SXENPK/"
