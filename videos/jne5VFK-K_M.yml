title: 'RailsConf 2020 CE - Building a Rails Controller From Scratch by Alex Kitchens'
language: English
recordingDate: 1588633204
description: "Building a Rails Controller From Scratch by Alex Kitchens\n\n\nIf you replaced ActionController with an implementation of your own, what would you have to build to get your app working again? In this talk, we'll do just that. We'll see how the controller interacts with the router to receive a request, process it, and return a response. We'll also rebuild controller features like Params, Controller Callbacks, and Rendering. In the end, we'll have a new functioning controller class called AwesomeController, and we will have seen what it takes to process a request in Rails.\n\n__________\n\nAlex Kitchens (@alexcameron89) is a software engineer at Stitch Fix, where he gets to embrace his love of Rails as a backend developer."
