title: 'Designing functional clothes with Haskell!'

description: "Noon van der Silk\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/218/\n\nI love wearing colourful clothes with funky patterns, but these are hard to find! Clothes with patterns that have rich and meaningful structure are my favourite. So, I have been learning how to use open-source “diagrams” library (written in Haskell) to make a wide variety of designs which can then be printed on different items of clothing. My inspiration and designs come from patterns I’ve found online or in life - like in tiles or artworks, or from fun mathematical structures.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will discuss how to use the “diagrams” library to create elegant, composable and parameterised graphics. This library is special in that it lets you manipulate drawings in a convenient way that is powerful and flexible. As such, it lets you build sophisticated structures out of simple components which you can reuse and put together in interesting ways. Also, it’s a great excuse to learn Haskell!\r\n\r\nFinally, I will show how to build a pipeline that enables open-source fashion design, so that you too can have a closet full of purely functional clothing!\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
