title: 'Baking a Microservice PI(e) with Antonio Goncalves Roberto Cortez'
language: English
recordingDate: 1526462420
description: "Imagine you have several microservices exposing REST APIs. Imagine now that these microservices are spread all over and need to talk to each other. Imagine that you have a nice user interface interacting with these APIs where you can authenticate. And now, imagine that all this runs smoothly.\n\nIn this Deep Dive session, Roberto and Antonio will build, step by step, a full microservice architecture (using Java and different frameworks). This session will answer these questions:\n\nHow to build, document and deploy several microservices spread on different nodes (we use a Raspberry PI cluster, because the Cloud is too expensive)\nHow to make those microservices talk to each other (Consul for registry and discovery)\nHow to scale up, down, and deal with network failures (Ribbon and Zuul to the rescue)\nHow to deal with high traffic (Hystrix, here you come)\nHow to monitor this distributed system (Dropwizard metrics with the ELK stack)\nHow to centralize configuration\nHow to authenticate and manage authorization with JWT (Tribestream Access Gateway)\nHow to have a centralized nice looking entry point (with Angular)"
