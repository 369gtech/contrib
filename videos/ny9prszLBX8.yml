recordingDate: 1563984102
description: 'When was the last time you took a day off? Are you going to the office every weekday? How often do you work with people? All these questions usually show one thing - we all have stress that comes from our work. Famous Work-Life balance is often non-existent in many organizations, and developers feel trapped in their daily routine to ''deliver a business value'' to their employer. With stress, your creativity shrinks and innovative approach dies in a busy work you do. What if I was to say it does not have to be that way? In this talk, we will discuss ways how to relax and avoid ''Stress Driven Development''. We will look at the problem from a perspective of an individual contributor, a technical lead, and a manager. As a result, the audience will be able to take away best practices for tackling stress and help others in their organizations to become more productive and simply happier individuals.'
