language: English
recordingDate: 1500463222
description: "Join us for our next conference: https://goo.gl/B2bqQ6\nWe value “working software over comprehensive documentation”. That is, while there is value in documentation, we value working software more. This prioritisation helps us get things done and avoid waste. However, both extremes are very common out there in the wild, development teams who avoid documentation altogether (“our code is self-documenting”), and teams who create way too much documentation. This talk is about the spectrum between those two extremes - as a Lead Developer, how do you find ways to leverage documentation as a means to make communication in the team more efficient, and align everybody to a common picture of the system they are building, without creating too much waste?\n\nAbout Birgitta Boeckeler\n\nBirgitta is a Lead consultant and software developer with ThoughtWorks in Germany. She has been building software across all layers for almost 15 years now, mainly in the space of large custom-developed websites. Birgitta thrives on juggling the complexities of building software and finding the simplicity in it, and loves that it never gets old. At ThoughtWorks, she is working on custom software delivery teams in the role of “tech lead”, splitting her days between coding, coaching, consulting and keeping things fun."
