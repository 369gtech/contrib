description: "Keynote: The Unification of Containers, Apps and Functions - Jason McGee, IBM Fellow, VP and CTO, IBM Cloud Platform, IBM \n\nCloud-native developers today have to decide between 3 separate container platforms. &nbsp;Some choose the flexibility of containers with Kubernetes, others the velocity of an opinionated platform like CloudFoundry, and still others believe the future is all about serverless functions. &nbsp;How do you know which ones to use? And should you have to choose? &nbsp;In this keynote, Jason McGee will share his vision for the marriage of containers, apps, and functions -- driven by Kubernetes, Istio and the emergence of Knative into a single combined container platform. &nbsp;It’s time to break down the silos and see how these projects’ paths are converging to solve real microservice dilemmas: security, scale, and operations. \n\nTo learn more: https://sched.co/GsxS"
