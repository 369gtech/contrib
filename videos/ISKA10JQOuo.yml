title: 'Node & Express as Workflow Tools'
recordingDate: 1401301543
description: "\"Enterprise\" and \"Node.js\" are generally two terms which are rarely seen together, but developing on an (what are considered) \"enterprise level\" stack doesn't mean you can't sneak some Node.js into your workflow. This talk will cover using Node.js, Express, Grunt/Gulp, Commander to build custom workflow tools, mock APIs, and test suites to allow you to maintain sanity while working with more traditional environments. We will cover a simple use case for using Node and Express to smooth Front-end development workflow, and how to package your custom tool as an NPM module for others to install.\n\nTopher Bullock\nAgile Engineer, Pivotal Labs\nhttps://twitter.com/topherbullock\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
