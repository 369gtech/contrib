description: 'Honeypots AND IoT security, all in one place? Yes, why YES I tell you, and this is it! Oh sure, honeypots are not new, but how they are used is what makes this talk just a little bit different. Presented for your viewing pleasure will be IoT specific honeypot configurations, some deployed with k8s (some not) and how they are used to not only trap attacks against your IoT devices but also detect attacks FROM a compromised IoT device.'
