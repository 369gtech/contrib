description: 'The world might be getting more connected but not less risky to hack. This talk will give IoT hackers a quick intro to the variety of legal pitfalls that govern IoT hacking, from the notorious Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and the DMCA to bug bounty legal terms and the “good-faith” security exemption now pending renewal. Hackers will learn which terms they should beware of in light of recent developments in anti-hacking laws, recent developments in CFAA case law and bug bounties legal scandals, and which strategies could be useful to comply with the DMCA security exemption and anti-hacking laws in general.'
