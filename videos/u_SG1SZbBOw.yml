language: English
recordingDate: 1619617951
description: "Original: https://youtu.be/e1HnlsIL8EE\n\nIn F# it is possible to define keywords in certain code contexts (and thatâ€™s what we are going to talk about). How it works, and why it can be useful, and how to write your very own DSL?... The presentation will come in handy even of you are not familiar with F#.\n\nAyrat Khudaygulov has been working a lot and tightly with F#, sketching up some decent production. I am at your service to share the secrets and experience.\n\nPresentation: https://disk.yandex.ru/i/5oMnCOuCGFAORA\nDotFest: https://2020.dotfest.ru"
