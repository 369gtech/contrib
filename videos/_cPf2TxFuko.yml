language: Italian
recordingDate: 1464092316
description: 'How many times have you thought it was unuseful to spend time in order to make tests as much usable, maintainable and automated as possible? This question is the nightmare of developers and testers. Here, we would like to introduce a new architecture that, potentially, is able to reach a general agreement, by using technologies you all know but structured in a different way, that is using microservices. We will talk about previous good and bad experiences, our current solution and a lot of kittens.'
