description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2013 in Santa Claraex, CA\nSpeaker: Jason Cline\nThe proliferation of mobile devices poses challenges for corporate IT departments. End users want to choose their own device, but also want to access corporate web applications, but the need for security often means that they have to surrender management of their device to their IT department. With this in mind, we've created Sencha Space -- a secure and managed environment for deploying HTML5 business applications that run on multiple devices. During this session Jason Cline, will discuss the Sencha Space SDK's device-level options for secure data storage, as well as show you how to implement the Invoke API to connect web applications with one another. You'll also experience how easily applications can be centrally managed without the need to access the device."
