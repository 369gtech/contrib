How else can we develop systems that take advantage of the power of Java? Dynamic proxies are such a tool. We can save thousands of lines of repetitive code with a single class. By taking a thorough look at how they work, we will recognize good use cases for them in our systems. \n\nAbout the Author \nDr. Heinz M. Kabutz is a Java Champion, the author of The Java Specialists' Newsletter, and a frequent speaker at Java conferences. \n\n*This book is for intermediate to advanced Java programmers who want to get to \"guru\" status. It is not suitable for beginners in Java."
