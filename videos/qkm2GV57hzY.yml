description: "Speaker: Derek Beauregard\nIn this demo we will explore the power of Spring XD in the context of the Internet of Things (IoT). We will look at a solution developed with Spring XD to stream real time analytics from a moving car using open standards. Ingestion of the real time data (location, speed, engine diagnostics, etc), analyzing it to provide highly accurate MPG and vehicle range prediction, as well as providing real time dashboards will all be covered. Watch this demo to get a sense of how Spring XD can serve as “Legos®” for the IoT.\n\nCheck out the full 90 minute session here: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cejQ46IQpUI"
