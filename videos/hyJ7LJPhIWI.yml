description: "Domain-Driven Design Europe 2019\nhttps://dddeurope.com\nhttps://twitter.com/ddd_eu\n\nLessons from Jerry Weinberg \n\nJerry Weinberg was a giant of the software world. I will talk about some of the many lessons I learned from Jerry, many of which were from his writing, some of which were from personal meetings. I will briefly describe how I applied the lessons I learned to the design of cyber-dojo (http://cyber-dojo.org). I will elaborate on some systems thinking ideas sparked by Jerrry. I will recount some true stories of Jerry's involvement in the Mercury project (the precursor to NASA's Apollo program).\n\nBiography\n\nI’m a software consultant specializing in practice, process, test driven development, and complex-adaptive systems-thinking. I’m 33 years old (hex) and I’ve loved software since I was 10 (decimal). I built cyber-dojo.org to promote deliberate practice for software developers. I’ve worked with Accenture, Aviva, Cisco, Ericsson, Friends Provident, HP, Microsoft, Opera, Ordnance Survey, RBS, Reuters, Renault F1, Schlumberger, Tandberg and many many more. If you don’t like my work I won’t invoice you. I’m the co-author (with Olve Maudal) of the Deep C/C++ slide deck (over 1,000,000 views) I’m the ex ECMA Task Group 2 C# convenor. I’ve had some C# books published. I’m the ex ACCU conference chairman. I’m married to the beautiful Natalie, and proud father of Ellie, Penny and Patrick. I love salmon fishing. I live in Somerset, England."
