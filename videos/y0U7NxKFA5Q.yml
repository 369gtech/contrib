description: "This session introduces metrics for evaluating Java application performance in a cloud environment, beyond traditional throughput, startup, and repose time metrics. It also presents new specific metrics applicable to the cloud, such as warm-up time for reaching a serverâ€™s peak performance when the server needs migration/scale-out. The session also presents some best practices for optimizing Java applications running in the cloud, primarily how to write, configure, and deploy a Java application to achieve better execution speed, I/O throughput, and scalability in a cloud environment.\n\n\nAuthor:\nHui Shi\nHui works in IBM Java Technology Center Shanghai.
