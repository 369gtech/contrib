This time, Jakob Gottlieb Svendsen, Chief Cloud engineer and Technical product owner at Saxo Bank will share how they are managing Azure.\n\n\"As a global bank we need to follow strict financial regulations and certifications. Our goal is an agile organization, where developers can provision and operate cloud resources, while Saxo Bank keeps in control and stays compliant.
