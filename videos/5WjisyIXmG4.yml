title: 'Fireside Chat #1: Career progression'
language: English
recordingDate: 1623225502
description: "In the first Fireside Chat, our co-founders Sandro Mancuso and Mashooq Badar and Spain Managing Director José E. Rodríguez Huerta talked about career progression. They discussed different drivers and how they shape different careers. \n\nThe idea of the Fireside chat series is to record many informal conversations we normally have outside working hours. Topics are normally decided just before we start recording. Our objective is to have spontaneous conversations instead of something more structured or scripted. \n\nFor more information about Codurance, please visit our website: https://codurance.com/."
