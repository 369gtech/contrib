description: "Speaker: Lennart Poettering (Red Hat)\n\nTalk of 20 minutes\n\nContainers are a hot topic on Linux. In this talk I'd like to give a quick overview what systemd provides in the area of containers, how it integrates with the various container managers, and how to use systemd's own minimal container manager systemd-nspawn. I'd like to specifically focus on the more recent changes in the area, and how this functionality has been adopted by the rkt container runtime.\n\nAbout Lennart Poettering:\n\nLennart works in the Server Experience Group at Red Hat, and lives in Berlin.\n\nEvent Page: http://2016.fossasia.org/schedule/#DO-02\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/ILQ0/"
