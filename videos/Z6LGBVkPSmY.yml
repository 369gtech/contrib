Thus, testing is crucial. In our project, we use graphical languages to specify smart contracts. We apply \nProperty Based Testing to effectively and efficiently test the smart contract generation and their behaviour. \n---\nTALK OBJECTIVES\nThe talk will introduce into smart contracts on blockchains and into property based testing including state-based property based testing. \n---\nTHEMES\ntesting, blockchain, PBT\n---\nCode BEAM Lite LDN was brought to you by Code Sync. \n\nCODE SYNC Website: www.codesync.global \nTwitter: www.twitter.com/CodeMeshIO Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/CodeSyncGlobal \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/code-sync/ Mail: info at codesync.global"
