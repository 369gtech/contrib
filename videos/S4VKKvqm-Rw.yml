description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nSponsored Session: MayaData - Beyond Operators and CSI, Cool Storage Tech Awaits! \n\nOperators and CSI have been discussed a lot at recent KubeCons. There’s good reason for that. They're both essential for simplifying stateful workloads. Operators make stateful apps approachable, and CSI de-couples upstream Kubernetes and storage systems. Both mean storage innovation is easier and quicker.  As a result, attendees might see some interesting names appearing for the first time. DPDK, SPDK, PMEM-CSI, COSI, and TiFlash are just a few that they might stumble across in the schedule. What’s remarkable, is how Operators and CSI are still present and essential for most of the presentations. They’re just becoming a “boring” yet essential part of the stack.  In this talk we’ll dive deeper into DPDK and SPDK. They open up some amazing speed potential for OpenEBS (a CNCF Sandbox project). Kubernetes is seeing the “cool” storage tech first, and that’s exciting! \n\nhttps://sched.co/ff0c"
