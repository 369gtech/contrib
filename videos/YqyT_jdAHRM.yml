recordingDate: 1620801392
description: "A lot of the hype around AI in recent years has come from the area of Deep Learning. I have been working with deep learning since 2017, and it has been a pleasure to be working in a field where things are moving so fast and things that previously felt impossible are suddenly within reach. I will talk about what deep learning is and why it is so hyped.\n\nKerstin Johnsson\nKerstin has been working with machine learning since 2011, in academia and in industry. She earned her PhD in applied mathematics in 2016 and has since then been working with deep learning for analysis of 3D medical images.\n\n___________________________\nFoo Café is a meeting place for people with an interest in software development and IT. \nHere, user groups and partner companies find the perfect atmosphere for sharing knowledge and develop competence. \nFoo Café is open for everyone and is free to attend.
