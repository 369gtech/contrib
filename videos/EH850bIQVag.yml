description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io\n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nCI/CD Pipelines and Machine Learning - Jeremy Lewi, Google\n\nThis sessions will be part of the larger Kubeflow presentation. This will specifically cover how to use CI/CD pipelines to serve machine learning models on Kubernetes via Kubeflow.Machine Learning requires a lot of training, experiments and retraining. It also requires a lot of data. Automating these can be difficult for many data scientists. Well now that we are able to make Machine Learning more cloud native via Kubeflow, allowing it to run on Kubernetes, we should now make use of the tooling that is available in a cloud native architecture. While most of my demo will involve WeaveWorks Flux, I will try to speak in general terms revolving around best practices in building a cloud native machine learning automation pipeline.\n\nFor more info click here: https://sched.co/FuJo"
