description: "Unity's ML Agents toolkit has provided beginners with an easy, visual introduction to Machine Learning for a few years now. In this 2nd episode in my weekly live game show series, I'm going to use Unity to implement 2 algorithms from 2 research papers out of Berkeley and DeepMind's AI labs this month (October 2020). As I code, I'll ask you a series of relevant questions and you'll be able to answer them live via a link that I'll share during the stream. At the end, I'll announce one winner and they'll receive a cryptocurrency reward + I'll perform a song for them. \n\nI want each of these streams to be increasingly more interactive, higher stakes, more reward, and more fun. So I hope to see you there! Bookmark this link, set a reminder, game on! :)"
