description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nBuilding a Global Supercomputer with Virtual Kubelet - Dmitry Mishin, University of California San Diego & Adrien Trouillaud, Admiralty \n\nNautilus is a global Kubernetes cluster, product of the Pacific Research Platform (PRP) project at The University of California San Diego (UCSD) and many collaborating campuses. It aggregates compute resources from around the world. While that's impressive, there are issues that a single cluster cannot solve: in this case, decentralized governance. PRP participants delegate the control of some of their compute resources to UCSD. That wouldn't scale to a global network of independent institutions. So PRP, along with peer projects nationwide, decided to adopt Admiralty's open-source multi-cluster scheduler, which allows for decentralized control plane topologies. Dmitry will demo the federation of Nautilus with the clusters of other large scientific networks; Adrien will explain how Admiralty implemented Virtual Kubelet and the Kubernetes scheduler framework to make this possible. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ekBh"
