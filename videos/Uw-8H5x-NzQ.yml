title: 'DEF CON Safe Mode   Aerospace Village   What I Learned Trying to Hack a 737'
language: English
recordingDate: 1598231644
description: "As part of work looking at avionics security, we reverse-engineered two Communication Management Units used on 737s, and they are engineered unlike any other embedded system Iâ€™ve seen. CMUs must be certified to a high Design Assurance Level, but airlines typically want to add custom airline operations applications. This talk explores how these seemingly incompatible requirements are met in two very different ways, and takes a deep dive into how the CMUs work.\n\nThis event will be coordinated on the DEF CON Discord server, in channel #av-aviation-text."
