description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nCloudstate—Towards Stateful Serverless - Jonas Bonér & James Roper, Lightbend \n\nThe Serverless experience is revolutionary and will grow to dominate the future of Cloud. FaaS however—with its ephemeral, stateless, and short-lived functions—is only the 1st step. It's great for processing-intensive, parallelizable workloads, but limited in use-cases, making it hard to impl general-purpose apps.  What’s needed is a next-gen Serverless platform for general-purpose app dev for our new world of real-time data & event-driven systems. What’s missing is: ways to manage distributed state in a scalable & available fashion, long-lived stateful services, ways to co-locate data & processing, and options for data consistency.  This talk will discuss challenges, requirements, and introduce you to our proposed solution: CloudState—an OSS project building next-gen Stateful Serverless on Akka, gRPC, Kubernetes & GraalVM, with client support for Go, JavaScript, Java, Swift and more.\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zeln"
