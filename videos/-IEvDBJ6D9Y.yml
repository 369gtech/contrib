title: 'Reverse Engineering a Bluetooth Lightbulb - Jesse Phelps'
recordingDate: 1552904210
description: "I recently made build lights for the company I work for and my home office. They integrate with TeamCity and indicate when a build is running and success/failure of all the tests. In this session, we will reverse engineer a bluetooth light bulbâ€™s protocol, learn how to have an Raspberry Pi communicate with the bulb, and by the end you too will know how to make your own build lights!\nPlease note that this talk will be highly technical. We will be discussing low level details of bluetooth communication, protocol analysis with Wireshark, sniffing bluetooth packets, etc.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
