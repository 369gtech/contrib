description: "Sally Applin is a Ph.D. student at the University of Kent at Canterbury, UK, in the Centre for Social Anthropology and Computing (CSAC). She holds a Masters degree from the graduate Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP) within New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, and a BA in Conceptual Design from San Francisco State University. Sally has had a 20 year career in the science museum design, computer software, telecommunications, and product design/definition industries working as a Senior UX designer and ethnographic researcher.\r\n\r\nSally is a founding member of Anthropunk, a movement that examines how people promote, manage, resist and endure change; hack their lives (and those of others); and create the context of the individuation of their experiences. She is currently researching the impact of technology on culture, and the consequent inverse: specifically the reifications of Virtual Space in Personal Space."
