description: "Google Tech Talks\nFebruary, 29 2008\n\nABSTRACT\n\n I will present recent work for acquiring, rendering, and displaying\nphotoreal models of people, objects, and dynamic performances. I will\noverview image-based lighting techniques for photorealistic compositing and\nreflectance acquisition techniques which have been used to create realistic\ndigital actors in films such as \"Spider Man 2\" and \"Superman Returns\". I\nwill then describe initial work with our lab's Light Stage 6 system to\ncombine image-based relighting with free-viewpoint video to capture and\nrender full-body performances. I will also describe a new 3D face scanning\nprocess that captures high-resolution skin detail by estimating surface\norientation from the skin's reflection of polarized spherical gradient\nillumination. I will conclude by describing a new 3D display that leverages\n5,000 frames per second video projection to show autostereoscopic,\ninteractive 3D imagery to any number of viewers simultaneously.\n\nSpeaker:  Dr. Paul Debevec, University of Southern California Institute for Creative Technologies\n Paul Debevec is the associate director of graphics research at USC's\nInstitute for Creative Technologies (USC ICT) and a research associate\nprofessor at USC's Department of Computer Science. His Ph.D. thesis at UC\nBerkeley presented Façade, an image-based modeling and rendering system for\ncreating photoreal virtual camera motion through architectural scenes from\nphotographs. Using Façade he led the creation of a photoreal animation of\nthe Berkeley campus for his 1997 film \"The Campanile Movie\" whose\ntechniques were later used to create virtual backgrounds for the \"The\nMatrix\"; he went on to demonstrate new image-based lighting techniques in\nhis animations \"Rendering with Natural Light\", \"Fiat Lux\", and \"The\nParthenon\". He also led the design of HDR Shop, the first widely used high\ndynamic range image editing program. Paul received ACM SIGGRAPH's\nSignificant New Researcher Award in 2001 and co-authored the book \"High\nDynamic Range Imaging\" in 2005. Most recently, he chaired the SIGGRAPH\n2007 Computer Animation Festival."
