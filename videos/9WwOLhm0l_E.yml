description: "It takes months to update everything in a software stack and you never know when or where something will break (but you know it will). Does it sounds familiar?\n\nIt is a familiar story to me and that lead me down a path where I played with many (un)stable tools and technologies in order to build a stable and reliable environment of Web and Standalone Applications. This is a (short) story of what I learned during that long journey, including how to talk with all the stakeholders (\"what ever they tell you, it's a people problem\") involved to deliver it and how to split a monolith from an architectural/deployment point of view.\n\nAlong the way I ran into people unaware (or denying) of existing and future issues, with superficial or no knowledge of those “alien” tools, vLANs issues, servers not connected to any network and people asking for docker images for everything or an image with everything and want to share the solutions so that others don't have to suffer like I did! I'll dive into dockerizing applications, managing images, system configurations, experimental features as well as running and scaling those containers.\n\nBest for system administrators, developers and DevOps.\n\nDavide Fiorentino \nStudied International Economics at University and IT at home and using Java for 20 years.
