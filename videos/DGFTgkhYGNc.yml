title: 'Why you should use F# (Part 2)'
recordingDate: 1531768189
description: 'F# is a functional programming language that runs on .NET. It is a perfect fit for developing backend services on .NET Core, modeling complex domains, and dealing with difficult data access problems. In fact, it powers the backends of some of our top customers in Azure! In this talk, we’ll take an existing F# web service running on .NET Core and refactor it to work other projects. If you’re familiar with F# or attended the first F# session, come see how you can take F# another step further!'
