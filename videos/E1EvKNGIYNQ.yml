description: "This video was recorded at ElixirConf EU Virtual 2020 - https://www.elixirconf.eu/\n\nMore great virtual tech conferences - https://codesync.global \n\n---\n\nBuilding an emergency software with Phoenix & Elixir \nby \nLinda Achieng Otieno and Simon de Haan\n\nABSTRACT\nNailinda is a medical emergency software in Kenya that does not require internet to send and receive messages and emergency request. We use USSD to communicate, capture the request, process it and send the message to the receiver or give a response to the sender - all depends on the content of the message. The receiver is also prompted to give a response, which we capture, process and send back to the initial sender. All this has been built with Phoenix and Elixir, we have used APIs to enable the capturing of the USSD responses.\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - Linda Achieng Otieno and Simon de Haan\n\nLinda is a Ruby and Elixir software developer. She actively works with both languages, Ruby for her official job and Elixir for the project Nailinda. She has been actively writing code for 3yrs now. She is also a mum to a cheeky 2yrs old.\n\nSimon is the Co founder and CTO for Turn.io. Simon is excited about technology, especially when it is applied to improve the lives of less privileged people. Growing up in the Middle East ruined him for the ordinary as those years left an unmistakable impression and set him on a direct course to be involved in community development, entrepreneurship and technology. Prior to Turn.io, Simon was the Chief Engineer for Praekelt.org, helping lead the launch of the world's first nationally integrated mobile pregnancy registry for the South African Department of Health and subsequently launching the world's first national health platform on the WhatsApp Business API.\n\n---\n\nElixirConf EU\nWebsite: https://www.elixirconf.eu/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ElixirConfEU"
