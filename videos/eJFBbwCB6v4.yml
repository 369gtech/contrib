description: 'When Funding Circle needed to scale its lending platform, we chose Kafka and stream processing. One of the best things we found about streaming architectures is how well they fit with functional languages. Clojure has been our choice for years, and we have developed applications that process millions of dollars in the US daily. In this talk, I will demonstrate how to develop production-ready applications using Clojure and Kafka Streams with a focus on libraries and techniques.'
