description: "Designing for the Abusive Ex\nAlex Chan\n\nSunday 16th, 11:30 (Assembly Room)\nA talk (25 minutes)\nApps and services often build features with good intent, trying to improve interactivity or connections between our users. But what if one of your users has a stalker, or an abusive ex? You may have given them another way to hurt or harass your user.\n\nThis session will help you identify common threat models – who is at most at-risk, and who is a threat to your most vulnerable users. Then we’ll look at some good practices that improve the safety of your users, and how to design with these risks in mind. There’s no silver bullet that totally eliminates risk, but you can make design decisions that give more control and safety to your users."
