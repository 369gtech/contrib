description: "The Future of In-container Configuration Management\n\nDiego Zamboni, CFEngine\n\nIT has undergone many technology disruptions over the last 30 years, from bare metal to VMs, to cloud and most recently containers. Each generation is bringing along new value propositions and enabling new applications, while at the same time making some technologies obsolete or less relevant.\n\nThe promised value propositions of containers are around speed and portability. By taking a historical perspective in considering the new value propositions and current application of containers, we will look at what role we might expect configuration management to play in managing containers from the inside. We will also look at which qualities a configuration management tool needs to satisfy in order to fill the needs of the container generation.\n\nView the full UCMS '14 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/ucms14/summit-program"
