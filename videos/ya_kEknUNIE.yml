description: "Get the Code: http://goo.gl/jZycT\r\n\r\nIn this part of the Java Video Tutorial series, I cover GridLayout, GridBagLayout, GridBagConstraints, Font, Insets and much more.\r\n\r\nI do this by showing you how to create a calculator layout with Java Swing. You'll see just how easy it is to layout a nice GUI interface using constraints. You don't necessarily need to measure X and Y coordinates to get everything to look right."
