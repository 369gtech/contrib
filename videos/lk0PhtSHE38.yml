title: 'The principles behind Differentiable Programming - Erik Meijer'
recordingDate: 1542729886
description: "Behind Every Great Deep Learning Framework Is An Even Greater Programming Languages Concept\n\nMy life with Haskell, Linq, Rx and beyond\nErik first caused some revolution in the interesting, but tiny, Haskell world. Then he decided to move on to Microsoft and to revolutionize C# and the .NET-world with Linq, maybe the largest change ever? His next step was to go open source and totally revolutionize several languages such as JavaScript, Java, C#, Python and so on with Reactive extensions (Rx) to make them support Reactive programming. For example Netflix has a lot of its success to thank Erik for! What is his next move? \nCome and listen to Erik's story from himself!\n\nFrom 2000 to early 2013 Erik Meijer was a software architect for Microsoft where he headed the Cloud Programmability Team. He then founded Applied Duality Inc. in 2013. Before that, he was an associate professor at Utrecht University. He received his Ph.D. from Nijmegen University in 1992.\nMeijer's research has included the areas of functional\nprogramming (particularly Haskell) compiler implementation, parsing, programming language design, XML, and foreign function interfaces.\n__________________________\nFoo Café is a meeting place for people with an interest in software development and IT. \n\nHere, user groups and partner companies find the perfect atmosphere for sharing knowledge and develop competence. \n\nFoo Café is open for everyone and is free to attend.
