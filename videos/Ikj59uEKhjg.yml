title: 'Lost in transaction? by Bernd Rücker'
recordingDate: 1519830163
description: "You probably work on a distributed system. Even if you don't yet face a serverless microservice architecture using a NoSQL database, you might \"just\" call some remote services via REST or SOAP. Welcome to a world without ACID transactions which leaves you in charge of dealing with difficult problems yourself e.g. eventual consistency, distributed transactions, compensation or message delivery semantics like \"exactly-once\"? In this talk, I’ll briefly describe why this will become the new normal and which challenges arise for us as developers. I will discuss strategies to deal with it and present real-life experiences, including recipes, patterns, but also frameworks. Expect fun little live hacking sessions with Open Source components like Spring, Hystrix, Kafka and Camunda.\n\nBernd Rücker, Camunda\nI started developing software more than 15 years ago. During my career I coached countless real-life software projects and helped many customers to implement business logic centered around long running flows, for example the order process of the rapid growing start-up Zalando selling clothes worldwide or the provisioning process for e.g. SIM cards at a couple of big telecommunication companies. During that time I contributed to various open source workflow engines. I am also author of two books and co-founder of Camunda. I am totally enthusiastic about how flows will be implemented in next generation architectures.\n\nRecorded at Jfokus 2018\nhttps://www.jfokus.se/jfokus18/schedule.jsp"
