description: "Everything you need to know about state management in React - Yoav starts with the difference between imperative and declarative paradigms, and what leads eventually to the React approach. But the React mechanism is not always enough, and sometimes we need to use external libraries.\nYoav talks about the MVC design pattern, which used to be popular before React, followed by an introduction to Flux design pattern, which is a great solution for state management in React, but can also be used without React. He wraps things wrap things up by building a Flux library together.\n\nBio:\nIn the past, Yoav worked as a firmware engineer at Intel, he then decided to change direction when he joined Wix Engineering, and moved to React Native development on the platform team."
