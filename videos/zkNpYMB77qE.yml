recordingDate: 1498818894
description: 'How do you take a complex web application, with a myriad of components and interactions, and make it fully responsive without pulling your hair out for a year? With a focus on Container Queries, we’ll look at the approach the Shopify Admin team used, from design to development, to manage the intricate interactions between all the application’s components, pulling off a fully fluid responsive design in under a month. We’ll also look at how this approach is currently being used at Xero to achieve unity between disparate tech stacks and to speed up the development process.'
