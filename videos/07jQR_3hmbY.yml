Why? Because over the past few years, companies have been storing their data. And this being done by each and every company, it has suddenly led to data explosion. Data has become the most abundant thing today. Data Science is also known as data driven science, which makes use of scientific methods, processes and systems to extract knowledge or insights from data in various forms, i.e either structured or unstructured. \n\n--------------------------------------\n\nPlease write back to us at sales@edureka.in or call us at IND: 9606058406 / US: 18338555775 (toll-free) for more information"
