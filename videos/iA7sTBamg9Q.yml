description: "Slides: https://slides.com/yaprakayazoglu/monolith-to-microfrontend\n\nRecently, bol.com seller dashboards, which used to be a monolith, decomposed into microfrontends defined by a business domain concept. We experimented on different ways of microfrontend techniques and picked one. Since each application can run independently on their own minimal setup, this gave the teams great flexibility, autonomy and yet improved the ownership of the individuals. Despite some drawbacks, such as UX consistency, performance issues, etc. this technique definitely proved itself within bol.com. In this case study, you will hear our gains from using microfrontends.\n\n---\n\nConFrontJS 2018 - #Frontend #Conference in #Warsaw, Poland\nDate: 29 October 2018\nVenue: Campus Warsaw, Poland\n\n??
