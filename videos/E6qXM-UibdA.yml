language: English
recordingDate: 1598069295
description: 'The concept of voting online is daunting to many because of the security risks, feasibility, and reliability. However, given the presence of election interference, limitations of in-person voting, and adoption of new technology, many countries are converting to electronic voting. In this talk, we discuss the theoretical and practical benefits and limitations of electronic voting. Emily Stamm will discuss the mathematics behind homomorphic encryption and blind signature schemes, with an emphasis on schemes that are secure against quantum computers. Porter Adams will discuss how these schemes and others are used in practice, and analyze the advantages and disadvantages of electronic voting.'
