It is supported by the Apache Software\n Foundation and is released under the Apache Software License.Lucene scoring is the heart of why we all love Lucene. It is blazingly fast and it hides almost \nall of the complexity from the user. In a nutshell,it works. At least, that is, until it doesn't work, or doesn't work as one would expect it to work. Then we are \nleft digging into Lucene internals or asking for help on java-user@lucene.apache.org to figure out why a document with five of our query terms scores lower than \na different document with only one of the query terms.\n\nLets go through this video to explore Lucene in depth.\nRelated post:\nhttp://www.edureka.co/blog/apache-solr-shedding-some-light/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=what-is-lucene\nhttp://www.edureka.co/blog/solr30thoct?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=what-is-lucene\n\nEdureka is a New Age e-learning platform that provides Instructor-Led Live, Online classes for learners who would prefer a hassle free and self paced learning\n environment, accessible from any part of the world.\n\n The topics related to ‘Apache Lucene' have been covered in our course ‘Apache Solr‘.
