You’ll learn what can be considered effective and ineffective definitions of these concepts, and the tools that can help in this process. Also, we’ll discuss how the team can have a shared understanding of what it means to be “done”.\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.eventbrite.sg/e/carousell-level-up-applying-scrum-for-better-delivery-part-2-tickets-26676989594?aff=ebapi\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/62t6/"
