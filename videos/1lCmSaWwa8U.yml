recordingDate: 1603367413
description: "Abstract:\nWhen it comes to using GraphQL with React Native, urql is the new kid on the block. I've had some time to use urql with React Native in production, and I'd like to share my experience: how to handle authentication, code sharing, caching, debugging effectively, and when you might or might not want to consider using urql on your next project."
