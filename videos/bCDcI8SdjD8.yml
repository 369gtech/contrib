description: "\"Speaker: Deepak K Gupta\n\n_**Welcome to the Machine Learning tutorial for absolute beginners.**_ \n\nThis tutorial will not make you an expert in Machine Learning but will cover enough things to acquaint, enable and empower you to understand, explore and exploits the concept and idea behind it.\n\n----------\n\n**We'll be learning by generating our own data with bare minimal data points (5 - 10) so that we can manually verify our machine learning algorithms to understand it better.**\n\n_This will also help us to see how changes in data can impact our Machine Learning Algorithms.  At the end of this tutorial, we'll also be using one real-world Dataset and play with it._\n\n----------\n\n_In this tutorial, I'll be covering at least 3 well-known ML algorithms(KNN, Linear and Logistic Regression) along with all the maths behind it. We'll end the tutorial with a real-world mapping application_\n\n_There is no major prerequisite for attending this, you just need to know the basics of python language and I'll cover the rest. We'll be using Scikit Learn for simplicity purpose, again, you don't need to have any prior experience with Scikit Learn or for that matter with Machine Learning_\n\n\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2019 and https://github.com/PyCon/2019-slides\""
