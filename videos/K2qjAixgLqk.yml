title: 'Reinforcement Learning Course: Intro to Advanced Actor Critic Methods'
language: English
recordingDate: 1627663544
description: "Actor critic methods are used in machine learning. They are most useful for applications in robotics as they allow us to output continuous, rather than discrete actions. This enables control of electric motors to actuate movement in robotic systems, at the expense of increased computational complexity.\n\n💻 Code for the algorithms covered:\n🔗 Actor Critic: https://github.com/philtabor/Youtube-Code-Repository/tree/master/ReinforcementLearning/PolicyGradient/actor_critic/tensorflow2\n🔗 Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG): https://github.com/philtabor/Youtube-Code-Repository/tree/master/ReinforcementLearning/PolicyGradient/DDPG/tensorflow2/pendulum\n🔗 Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (TD3): https://github.com/philtabor/Youtube-Code-Repository/tree/master/ReinforcementLearning/PolicyGradient/TD3/tf2\n🔗 Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO): https://github.com/philtabor/Youtube-Code-Repository/tree/master/ReinforcementLearning/PolicyGradient/PPO/torch\n🔗 Soft Actor Critic (SAC): https://github.com/philtabor/Youtube-Code-Repository/tree/master/ReinforcementLearning/PolicyGradient/SAC/tf2\n🔗 Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic (A3C): https://github.com/philtabor/Youtube-Code-Repository/tree/master/ReinforcementLearning/PolicyGradient/A3C/pytorch\n\n✏️ Course from Phil Tabor.
