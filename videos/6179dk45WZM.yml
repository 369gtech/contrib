Given that, why have so many organizations used a different number of microservices? The panelists discuss the architecture of their various systems, what trade-offs they have made in the design of their systems, and how their system has evolved over time.\n\nThis presentation was recorded at QCon London 2020: http://bit.ly/2VfRldq \n\n#Microservices #SoftwareArchitecture #InfoQ"
