description: "Ближайшая конференция — DotNext 2020 Moscow\n2-5 декабря, Online\nПодробности и билеты: https://dotnext-moscow.ru/\n\n. Ближайшая конференция — DotNext\_2020 Piter\n15-18 июня, Online\nПодробности и билеты: https://bit.ly/dotnext2020piter\n\n. We all love Resharper and its amazing code analysis capabilities, right? In this talk you will learn how to use the new .NET Compiler Platform \"Roslyn\" to build code analysis and IDE refactoring extensions yourself. Enforce coding conventions? Why not. Finding logical issues on the code? Absolutely. Rearrange files in the project? Easy. We'll have a look at everything that's needed to build such code analysis components, such as for example, how you can traverse the syntax trees and obtain semantic information about a code base using Roslyn. There is also a plot twist - are such tools usable with Visual Studio only? We'll find out."
