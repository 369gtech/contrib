title: 'Fluxing Up Your .NET Apps - Alex Dunn - NDC Oslo 2020'
recordingDate: 1599850133
description: "Learn about the Flux design pattern and how to implement it in your C# client applications like UWP, Xamarin, and all the other platforms .NET is touching now.\n\nWe'll compare Flux and Uni-Directional data flows to the existing tools and directions development takes us in C# client apps and talk about all the pros and cons that come with both. We'll take an existing Xamarin.Forms app using MVVM and \"Flux it Up\" to migrate to a more 1-direction flow of data and actions.\n\nWhen you leave, you'll have a solid understanding of Flux and some of its existing implementations such as Redux and be confident in implementing it yourself in C#!"
