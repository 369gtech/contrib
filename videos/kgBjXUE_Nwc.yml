Alex Pinkney talks about two popular sorting algorithms and how they 'scale up.'\n\nFollow up film \"Quick Sort\": http://youtu.be/XE4VP_8Y0BU\n\nAlex's code that generated the data for the tests: \nhttps://github.com/apinkney97/Sorts\n\nAlex's graph of all the results: \nhttp://eprg.org/allplots.pdf\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/computerphile\nhttps://twitter.com/computer_phile\n\nThis video was filmed and edited by Sean Riley.\n\nComputer Science at the University of Nottingham: http://bit.ly/nottscomputer\n\nComputerphile is a sister project to Brady Haran's Numberphile.
