recordingDate: 1572861686
description: "Let’s connect our front door to the internet! What could possibly go wrong? Securing IoT is hard, and the last thing we want to do is let some stranger in!\n\nLet’s take a step back and consider other ways of securing that door, and granting access remotely. How can we do this without connecting your door to the internet, and while adhering to common protocols and data formats throughout?\n\nIn this talk, you will learn:\n\nhow JSON Web Tokens can be used to transmit credentials to an air-gapped device;\nhow this process can still allow someone to grant remote access;\nhow to apply this theory to other IoT devices; and\nhow this theory can help even in IoT devices that need direct internet access.\n\nThe talk includes a live demo, featuring an actual door.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks, courses, and conferences in the following links:\nhttps://ndcsydney.com/\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
