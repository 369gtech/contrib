description: "Learning web development is difficult. This is especially true for those who choose the self-taught track, and are responsible for everything from selecting the best learning materials to carving out time to study (often while working a full-time job). Is there any way to stop the insanity already?  \n\nIn this video, I’m going to show you five secret weapons for learning web development. I didn’t pick up these tools all at once, but once I had them arsenal my learning speed and knowledge retention shot through the roof! \n\n?Video from RealToughCandy.
