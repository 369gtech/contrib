description: "Shift Left is all about integrating tests earlier in the software development life cycle. It's writing your automated tests prior to, or alongside, coding. Although it requires using new techniques likes BDD and TDD, it's more about changing the mindset around quality. It's about evolving the culture within the agile team - only then can we be successful in achieving continuous testing.\n\nAt Vanguard we began using the Agile methodology about 10 years ago. Even though we were an “agile team” it took months before delivering features to production. We were tired of running regression tests for weeks and uncovering a lot of defects. Developers were just throwing code over the wall for someone who cares about quality. How did we change this? And how did we go from taking months to release to days? It all starts with changing the mindset around quality. Baking in quality versus testing quality afterwards starts from having the entire team own quality.\n\nWe were challenged by the business to have over 1000 software engineers adopt Shift Left in order to achieve our dream of continuous testing. Come and learn how we were able to drive this mindset change across the enterprise.\n\nSheetal Patel is a Senior IT Program Manager at the Vanguard Group leading a transformational change to modernize how we develop and test software across IT to enable Continuous Delivery. Sheetal leads a team responsible for bringing contemporary software testing practices to a development staff of over 1000 IT professionals. Sheetal’s team is driving new change to bring people, process and technology change to over 200 teams in Vanguard’ IT organization."
