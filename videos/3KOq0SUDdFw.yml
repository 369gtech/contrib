Even after the demise of its parent company, Basho, many projects continue to use its core to build large scale and robust distributed systems. A group of previous Riak users and developers has risen to help move the database forward and has started to address several long-lived issues.\n\nThis talk reports on the progress of a Google Summer of Code project that tackled Riak Test: a key component to running Riak integration tests. In our work, we replaced the existing custom test runner that had several issues by the standard Common Test framework. We also discuss, based on our experience, on how companies that use Erlang or Elixir, can effectively leverage the Google Summer of Code programme to advance their development, manage resources more efficiently, and bridge Erlang's tough learning curve by pairing students with more experienced developers.\n---\nTALK OBJECTIVES\nDemonstrate that implementing a custom test runner is highly challenging.\nShow how our work changed the way Riak runs integration and regression tests.\nDisseminate a previously obscure code intercept library from Basho that may be useful for the community.\nProve the usefulness and importance of leveraging the Google Summer of Code initiative for companies in the BEAM community.\n---\nTHEMES\nRiak, Common Test, GSoC\n---\nCode BEAM Lite LDN was brought to you by Code Sync. \n\nCODE SYNC Website: www.codesync.global \nTwitter: www.twitter.com/CodeMeshIO Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/CodeSyncGlobal \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/code-sync/ Mail: info at codesync.global"
