description: "DOES19 Las Vegas — Hybrid IT is all about harnessing the power of the digital age to deliver, analyze, adapt and innovate your enterprise’s critical functions—regardless of technology or platform. While distributed platforms have employed DevOps practices to accelerate digital transformation, mainframe organizations have been challenged with making the mainframe more readily consumable across all platforms and by the next-generation workforce, limiting the ability to deliver value to the business.\n \nThe mainframe community has come together to address this critical issue by opening the platform, in a controlled manner, to the modern world of DevOps practices and off-platform, open sourcing tooling. \n \nThe Zowe open source framework provides a cloud-like interface to the mainframe enabling teams to adopt practices and tools now common elsewhere in the organization. Incorporating the mainframe into these proven practices opens the door to powerful cross-platform applications and experiences. \n\nThis distinguished panel will describe the striking productivity gains and software acceleration they’ve realized by extending modern DevOps to the mainframe, thereby unlocking the value of Hybrid IT.\n\nDOES19 Las Vegas\nDOES 2019 US\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
