title: 'YOW! Data 2020 - Dr Eugene Dubossarsky - The Data Literacy Revolution'
language: English
recordingDate: 1609291404
description: "The popularity and ubiquity of data science, data analytics, AI and the trend towards digital transformation have led to massive, repeated failures in many businesses. Despite billions spent, hundreds of Ph.D.s hired, and much boasting in conference presentations, many enterprises are still struggling to leverage the value of these new technologies. The missing ingredient is the literacy of the rest of the organisation, particularly senior management. This presentation will describe this new literacy: “data literacy”, the analogy with computer literacy, and reasons why this skill set will soon be as essential to all professionals as computer literacy is today. It will address issues of automation, the advent of decision making as the key managerial activity and the resulting democratisation of AI and analytics, however still maintaining a class of data science and analytics experts. The presentation will address issues of mindset, as well as skill set, and the ways in which management engagement with data analytics must change to leverage its value.\n\nDr Eugene Dubossarsky is leader in the analytics field in Australia, with over 22 years’ commercial data science experience. He is the Managing Partner of the AlphaZetta global training Academy as well as AlphaZetta's Chief Data Scientist. He is also the founder of the Australia–New Zealand Data Analytics Network, with over 20,000 members, and the head of the Data Science Sydney group (6,600+ members), and Big Data Analytics Sydney (7000+ members) . He is regularly invited as a conference presenter, consultant and advisor, and appears on podcasts, in print and on television to discuss data science and analytics, and advisory board member for listed companies, advising on AI and Data Science. Eugene also applies data science in an entrepreneurial setting, to financial trading and online startups, and is the creator of ggraptR, an interactive visualisation package in R.\n\nFor more information on YOW!
