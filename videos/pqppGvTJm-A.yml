description: "DOES19 Las Vegas â€” The business impact of high-performance DevOps has been proven widely. Unfortunately, as enterprises now try to use big data with machine learning, data science tends to get left behind. Challenges that engineers and data scientists face when developing an ML-based system are reliably deploying models, managing ML assets at scale, and knowing when models are going stale. Introducing a DevOps approach to Machine learning helps solve these challenges by providing structure for collaborating and bringing models into production.  This talk covers real improvements that MLOps has brought to large enterprise customers in maintaining asset integrity across teams, accelerating model operationalization, and enabling a sophisticated AI application lifecycle. We share pointers on how you can follow the same journey in your org.\n\nDOES19 Las Vegas\nDOES 2019 US\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
