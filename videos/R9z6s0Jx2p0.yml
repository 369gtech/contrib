language: English
recordingDate: 1545587077
description: "At Uber, we are using natural language processing and conversational AI to improve the user experience. In my talk I will be delving into 2 use cases. In the first application we use natural language processing and machine learning to improve our customer care. The other use case is the recent launch of a smart in-app reply system that allows driver partners to respond to incoming rider messages at a click-of-a-button. Finally, we will cover the components common to most conversational AI systems.\n\nEVENT:\n\nMLConf 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nFranziska Bell, Senior Data Science Manager on the Platform Team, Uber\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nMLConf Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to publish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nMLConf YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjeM1xxYb_37bZfyparLS3Q"
