title: Z-Fighting
recordingDate: 1384262818
description: 'OpenGL and DirectX both suffer from z-fighting (also known as depth-fighting). To prevent z-fighting, the near and far planes must be spaced together as much as posible. Then, objects in projected space maintain a maximum depth z value so that depth values of one fragment do not unintentionally overlap others.'
