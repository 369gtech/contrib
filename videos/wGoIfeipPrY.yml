language: English
recordingDate: 1636393580
description: "The software industry today is very different than it was 20 years ago. Over time the perception of roles, core skills and needs for companies in the space have evolved, giving rise to a new breath of technical leadership and managerial styles. However, these skills and profiles are in short supply. Why is that? What can be done?\n\nIn this talk José will share some personal reflections on the topic, some lessons learned when he has tried to tackle these problems and some ideas that you could take and implement in your organisations.\n\nWatch thousands more tech-related talks in our SkillsCast library at https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts​"
