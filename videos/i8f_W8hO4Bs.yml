description: "Speaker: Stephanie Campanella\n\nDo you struggle to find the right clients who are willing to pay what you’re worth? What if there was a way for you to turn the tide, and have the clients find you.\n\nI’ll show you how to market and sell to a niche so you never have to worry about lead-generation again.\n\nAbout the speaker\n\nWith a love for fine art and a knack for computers Graphic Design seemed the right ‘fit’ for me. As I moved out of college and started ‘working for the man’ I was retrenched and left stranded. I quickly realised I had to take action and forge my own destiny.\n\nI’ve built 2 incredible brands and built up a talented team to help deliver to our clients.\n\nIt kills me to see other creatives not thriving in their business. Taking any work they can get and not charging what they’re truly worth.\n\nI’m on a mission to change this.\n\nMy vision is that every creative is THRIVING in their business. Has a steady amount of recurring revenue in place and has a team in place they can rely on.\n\nWhen I’m not mentoring creatives so they can THRIVE in their business and create the FREEDOM they SO deserve I’m eating my way through every Mexican restaurant in Sydney whilst wearing my Lorna Jane activewear.\n\nEvent Page: https://2019.singapore.wordcamp.org/sessions/#wcorg-session-1217\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/BEBE8/"
