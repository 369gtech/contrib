title: 'Hyperparameter Optimization - The Math of Intelligence #7'
language: English
recordingDate: 1501250309
description: "Hyperparameters are the magic numbers of machine learning. We're going to learn how to find them in a more intelligent way than just trial-and-error. We'll go over grid search, random search, and Bayesian Optimization. I'll also cover the difference between Bayesian and Frequentist probability. \n\nCode for this video: https://github.com/llSourcell/hyperparameter_optimization_strategies\n\nNoah's Winning Code:\nhttps://github.com/NoahLidell/math-of-intelligence/tree/master/probability_theory\n\nHammad's Runner-up Code:\nhttps://github.com/hammadshaikhha/Math-of-Machine-Learning-Course-by-Siraj/tree/master/Naive%20Bayes%20Classifier\n\nMore learning resources:\nhttps://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~bengioy/cifar/NCAP2014-summerschool/slides/Ryan_adams_140814_bayesopt_ncap.pdf\nhttps://thuijskens.github.io/2016/12/29/bayesian-optimisation/\nhttps://jmhessel.github.io/Bayesian-Optimization/\nhttps://arimo.com/data-science/2016/bayesian-optimization-hyperparameter-tuning/\nhttps://dhnzl.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/fuzzymad2016_bo_pdf.pdf\nhttp://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2016/06/bayesian-optimization-of-machine-learning-models.html\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWQDeB9WqvU\nhttps://nlpers.blogspot.nl/2014/10/hyperparameter-search-bayesian.html\nhttp://neupy.com/2016/12/17/hyperparameter_optimization_for_neural_networks.html\n\nJoin us in the Wizards Slack channel:\nhttp://wizards.herokuapp.com/\n\nAnd please support me on Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/user?u=3191693\n\nThanks to Veritasium (bayesian animation) & Angela Schoellig (drone clip)\nFollow me:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/sirajraval\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/sirajology Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/sirajraval/ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/sirajraval/"
