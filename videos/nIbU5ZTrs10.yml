title: 'Event Driven Development: Leveraging the observer design pattern in Laravel'
recordingDate: 1596178056
description: "The observer design pattern is an extremely powerful tool. It allows developers to hook into various different parts of an application’s lifecycle in order to trigger other actions such as email notifications, third-party API calls, message broadcasting and much more.\n\nThis interactive presentation will take the audience on the journey from getting started with events to showcasing how they can be leveraged in our applications. We’ll discuss the benefits of this design pattern on the structure and readability of our projects along the way.\n\n## About Norfolk Developers\n\nComplementing the existing tech community, Norfolk Developers will be peeling back the high level and going straight to the heart of software development practices and processes.
