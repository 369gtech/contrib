description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nMachine Learning on Kubernetes at Shell: A Kubeflow Journey - Alex Iankoulski, Shell New Energies & Vangelis Koukis, Arrikto \n\nIn this session, Shell describes the lessons learned from working with multiple Machine Learning platforms and tools, the challenges of different systems, why we chose Kubeflow, and how we are now delivering successful models faster and at scale. Follow our journey as we learned how to deploy highly available, scalable, and secure Kubeflow clusters in the public cloud. We will describe the lessons learned and steps taken to improve our deployments including enterprise authentication and authorization, network integration, and data science workflows. We also discuss why we moved away from other platforms and chose Kubeflow, and how it has increased our Data Scientists’ productivity and reduced DevOps overhead. Today our teams are more self-sufficient, and iterate faster to produce production-ready models in a timely fashion. A zero to hero story made possible by Kubeflow and Kubernetes \n\nhttps://sched.co/ekBt"
