description: "Recording brought to you by American Express https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs\nKotlin/Native runtime is designed to minimize possible programmers mistakes related to concurrency and undesired mutable state. To achieve this goal, while keeping the source-level compatibility with Kotlin, runtime and standard library was carefully designed to avoid concurrently accessible mutable state. In this talk we discuss both reasoning behind this design, design and implementation details of the runtime and compiler. Also generic topics of automated memory management in the compiled language are covered.\n\nAbout Nikolay Igotti:\nWorked on various system level software (Hotspot JVM, VirtualBox, Native Client) at Sun, EMC, Oracle and Google. Now implementing native backend and the runtime for Kotlin programming language."
