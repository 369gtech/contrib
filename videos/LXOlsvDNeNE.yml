title: 'Simon Thompson - Evolving your Projects with Wrangler'
language: English
recordingDate: 1405097537
description: "Systems that are valuable have to be evolved. For instance, if you use a regular expression library in Erlang, you will have had to migrate from regexp to re; if you wish to migrate from R16 to R17, there are a number of changes that you may need to make.\n\nIn this talk we'll show how Wrangler can help with this. Wrangler has an API migration facility - which we'll demonstrate - and this is built on an extensibility API and DSL for Wrangler that allows you to write your own refactorings and transformations for yourself, using Erlang syntax to describe what it is you want to do.\n\nThe talk will be illustrated with short demos to show how it works hands on.\nTalk objectives:\n\nThe talk will give you experience of what Wrangler can do, seeing it in action on various scenarios. After the talk you should be confident about what it can do for you, as well as seeing how to use it in practice.\nTarget audience:\n\nThis talk is for anyone who builds and maintains Erlang projects and who wants to use a tool that will help with some of that. Wrangler can help with the mundane tasks and free you up to solve the more complex problems."
