recordingDate: 1402930999
description: "This talk covers build tooling, processes, and your development workflow. You'll get a glimpse as to why you should be building, and why you should put together a build process from the get-go. Then we'll move on to tooling. Here I'll discuss some of the most popular JavaScript build tools, namely Grunt, Gulp, and npm.\n\nWe'll investigate how each one performs for certain tasks, and I'll help you forge your own build sword. Lastly, I'll discuss the benefits of going for the module format Node.js uses, which is Common.js, and how you can leverage those modules in the browser, using a tool called Browserify.\n\nSlides: https://speakerdeck.com/bevacqua/front-end-ops-tooling\n\nhttp://2014.jsconf.us/"
