title: 'Correcting Common Mistakes When Using Async/Await in .NET - Brandon Minnick'
recordingDate: 1540452679
description: "I’m here to tell a scary story; one of inefficient code and unhandled exceptions. A story about a .NET developer who used async/await, but didn’t fully understand the framework. Their code started experiencing strange bugs. Their app size was strangely large. GASP!\nDon’t let this happen to you.\nIn this campfire session, we are diving deep into the world of asynchronous programming to dissect how the .NET compiler handles asynchronous code and we'll learn how small improvements to our asynchronous code can create huge performance gains.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcsydney.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
