title: 'Deploying a machine learning model to the cloud using AWS Lambda - Dr. Benjamin Weigel'
language: English
recordingDate: 1533144028
description: "PyData Berlin 2018\n\nTake your machine learning model out of your desk drawer and show its benefit to the world through a simple API using AWS Lambda and API gateway. This tutorial will bridge the gap between having a machine learning model (e.g. in your Jupyter notebooks) and taking it to a level where others can benefit from it (i.e. through an API).\n\nSlides: https://bweigel.github.io/pydata_bln_2018/\n---\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
