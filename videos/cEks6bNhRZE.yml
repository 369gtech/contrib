description: "With great computing power comes great responsibility.\n\n\nIn this talk, we look into one example of edge computing that is of particular interest for the security domain: biometric access control. This talk wants to be a technical journey into one of the devices that we found to be largely vulnerable. We will first discuss the general weakness of the edge computing model and then walk through technical details of the vulnerabilities that we identified (currently in responsible disclosure, ZDI-CAN-9990, 9991, 9992, 9993), including: server command forgery, user arbitrary addition, privilege escalation, man-in-the-middle, and face database exposure. We will demo how to leak employee pictures, automatically add unauthorized personnel as administrator, and impersonate a back-end server in order to open the doors and leave a false trace to deceive auditions.\n\n\n=== \n\n\nPhilippe Lin is a senior threat researcher in Trend Micro. He is mainly working on data analysis, embedded system and software defined radio. He was a BIOS engineer, a maker, and an enthusiast of open source software.\n\n\n\n--- \n\n\nRoel Reyes is a senior threat researcher from the Forward Threat Research team at Trend Micro. With more than 10 years experience in the cybersecurity industry, he enjoys research and development of on-premise and cloud-based infrastructure builds. He started the carrier as a quality assurance engineer for the Content Security Team, contributing to the efficiency improvements in web and email pattern solution creation. He also became part of the Web Reputation Services Team, developing web-based solutions focused on system enhancements and improvements.\n\n\n\n--- \n\n\nMorton was born in New York City and was raised and educated in New York, USA, Brighton, UK and Hamburg, Germany. I received my Master’s and Doctor’s degree from the University of Hamburg, Germany. In 1996, Morton joined IBM Research’s Massively Distributed Systems Research department to work on the IBM Digital Immune System and IBM Antivirus. Previously he had been involved with antivirus research at the Virus Test Center, University of Hamburg under Prof. Dr. Brunnstein from it’s beginnings in 1988 and was a co-founder of S&S International Deutschland GmbH, an antivirus and data recovery company now owned by Intel, Inc. After taking a professorship at CUNY’s John Jay College of Criminal Justice, teaching computer forensics, he is now working for Trend Micro, GmbH, in Germany. His Master’s thesis was on dynamic virus analysis system, called VIDES, that became a major component of the Digital Immune System and is the first known Malware sandbox system. His PhD thesis was on Malware Intrusion Detection, where the fields of malware detection and intrusion detection were merged and a new model of Malware and attack defence was introduced as the advanced autonomic defense architecture. Recent research at Trend Micro revolves around processing massive amounts of data to extract threat intelligence.\n\n\n\n--- \n\n\nJoey is a Senior Threat Researcher and Architect for the Forward-looking Threat Research Team in Trend Micro Research. He has been with Trend Micro since 2003 after leaving college in Manila, PH. After starting in Malware analysis, he worked on an honeypot system for email-Malware. This led to an analysis of the Koobface Malware’s infrastructure for spreading and exploitation. He then concentrated for a few years on a novel infrastructure for threat analysis and was an early pioneer of data streaming for big-data analytics. More recently, he has been building systems on a hybrid private and public AWS cloud. His research interests now involve the study of cloud-specific attacks, as well as new computing paradigms and their related threats.\n\n\n\n--- \n\n\nDr. Vincenzo Ciancaglini earned a M.Sc. in Telecommunications Engineering from the Politecnico of Turin and a M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering, Wireless Systems, from the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. For several years, he worked as a developer at a travel IT company in Sophia Antipolis, France. During this period, he also took part in the formation of a research and innovation lab within his company, where he was responsible for analysing new upcoming technologies and their potential business developments. From 2009-2013, he obtained his PhD from the National Research Institute in Automation and Computer Science (INRIA) in Sophia Antipolis, with a thesis about peer-to-peer networks interoperability and next-generation internet protocols. Since 2012, he has worked at Trend Micro as a research scientist and senior threat researcher within the Forward-Looking Threat Research team in Trend Micro Research. His duties on the team spans from the development of new data analytics prototypes to identify new upcoming threats, analysis of darknet and underground forums to the research to the research of IOT vulnerabilities."
