title: 'Scalable, spatially-accurate Contact Tracing with APEX!'
language: English
recordingDate: 1590098143
description: "If you have the need to do contact tracing based on GPS tracks (or other coordinates) now you can!\n\nThis Oracle APEX Office Hours session shows how to use Oracle Database spatial features to build an APEX application for contact tracing. Based on a real-world customer use case, the spatial analysis discovers how to find all people that came within a specified distance of a given person during a selected time period. It also shows how long they were in close proximity. The results can be displayed using maps, reports or other APEX visualizations."
