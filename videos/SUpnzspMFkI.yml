description: "Adam Bien, Consultant / Contractor, Adam Bien\n\nThis session’s speaker creates a single-page application from scratch without frameworks or dependencies and with web standards/browser APIs only. He starts with responsive layout over data binding, back-end communication, form validation, and stop with offline apps. No frameworks, no migrations, no builds, no translations—just plain CSS 3, modern JavaScript, and HTML 5. Your questions during the session will be highly appreciated."
