description: "Our Scalability Journey with CF for K8s - Kesavan Subramanian & Pavan Sundareshan, SAP\n\nCloud Foundry for Kubernetes (cf-for-k8s) provides a way to bring Cloud Foundry Stack on traditional virtual machines to containerization platforms like K8S without compromising the cf push user experience, makes it operator friendly too. It opens up the new dimensions in terms of scalability where we can run a dedicated CF foundation per customer and k8s already gives us flexibility in terms of self managing and operating these foundations at scale. This talk focuses on the scalability aspects of such cf-for-k8s single foundation and share the results of scalability experiments achieved so far which would be useful for platform engineers and operators."
