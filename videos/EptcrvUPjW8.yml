description: "by Hong Phuc\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/H.2215/fossasia.webm\n\n\nI grew up in the Mekong Delta, South of Vietnam. I first learned about free software at a FOSS event in Hanoi in 2007. I started to engage with the local Linux User Group in Singapore during my study time. Later on, I co-founded FOSSASIA - a community devoted to improving people’s lives through sharing Open Technologies and knowledge. I especially wanted to connect people together and to encourage developers from the region to participate in the Free and Open Source Software movement. Since then, FOSSASIA has become one of the largest open source communities in Asia. \n\nDuring this session, I will speak about challenges and lessons learned in the last 10 years of building FOSS community in Asia. \n\nRoom: H.2215 (Ferrer)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 15:00:00+01"
