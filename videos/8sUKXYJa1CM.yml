description: "Speaker: Harald Zeitlhofer (@HZeitlhofer)\n\nYour users complain about the bad performance of your app or website? Developers blame the database? How can we find the cause for the performance hotspot?\n\nFar too often the database is held responsible for performance or scalability problems. It seems to be main contributor to the overall web request response time. However, in many cases itâ€™s not the database itself, but the way, how the application is using the database! Too many database statements, inefficient queries and poor index selection are among the common problem patterns.\n\nBased on real life examples, you will learn how to approach performance problems, how to figure out if the database is really to blame and how to end the finger pointing between developers and DBAs.\n\nAbout the speaker:\n\nHarald Zeitlhofer has 15+ years of experience as an architect and developer of enterprise ERP solutions and web applications with a main focus on efficient and performant business processes, usability and application design. As a Technology Strategist in Dynatrace's Innovation Lab he influences the Dynatrace product strategy by working closely with customers and driving their performance management and improvement at the front line. He is a frequent speaker at conferences and meetup groups around the world.\n\nEvent Page: https://2016.phpconf.asia\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/VGXg/"
