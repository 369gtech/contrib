description: "\"Observability in Serverless applications\" by Ran Ribenzaft\nServerless and FaaS naturally fit microservices architectures. Observability of such systems is very complicated, since each microservice is separated and working asynchronously from the others. Distributed tracing is a key approach to understand such systems. In serverless, there are new challenges and opportunities which make distributed tracing a very interesting and useful technique for high observability."
