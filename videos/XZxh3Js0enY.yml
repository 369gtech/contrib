description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io\_The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nEnabling Elastic Inference on Edge With Knative and EDL - Ti Zhou & Daxiang Dong, Baidu \n\nThe emergence of 5G technology has made it increasingly important to reduce costs by deploying model inference on edge. Baidu internally deploys recommendation model inference on distributed CDN nodes by leveraging Knative and EDL, reduced core network load by 25% and network communication latency by 40%, thus the accuracy of recommendation model inference service got improved.  This talk will share some experiences & lessons Baidu learnt from deploying and optimizing recommendation model inference on edge by leveraging Knative and EDL, including inference auto-scaling and ingress traffic optimization based on geographic location, cold start optimization on CDN node with model pre-loading and legacy services interaction with Cloud Events. \n\nhttps://sched.co/cp9g"
