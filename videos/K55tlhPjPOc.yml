description: "What does it take to make the machine understand its environment while moving around (or flying)? How to teach a drone to race on its own safely in unfriendly environment? During our talk, you will participate in all the stages of this exciting adventure from the first lines of code, through algorithmic struggles up to complete system ready to participate in the drone racing league.\n\n# Krzysztof Kudrynski\n8AM-4PM: Passionate problem solver with 10+ years experience in algorithms prototyping and software design, currently involved in projects related to self-driving cars in TomTom. 4PM-0AM: Loving husband and father of three 0AM-3AM: Enthusiast of technologies of the future including artificial intelligence, robotics and virtual reality. 3AM-8AM: Sleepwalker\n\n# Blazej Kubiak \nBlazej Kubiak is enthusiast of all aspects of big data processing and all technologies that bring this enthusiasm from dream into reality. Blazej has been working in Tele Atlas and TomTom for eight years and has been involved in many challenging projects related to image and laser data processing. Blazej is one of the authors of automated traffic signs detection systems and bird-eye image mosaic creation tools. Currently he works as Expert Software Engineer in areas of Deep Neural Networks for object detection and recognition."
