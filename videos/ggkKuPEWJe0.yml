description: "Spring I/O Bridge (online conference) - 15 May 2020\n\nGitHub repo: https://github.com/saturnism/spring-boot-starter-example\n\nSpring Boot and Spring Cloud offers unprecedented abstraction layer that offers solutions to all sorts of common concerns - security, data access, messaging, configuration, caching, distributed tracing, and more. All of these layers also provide extension points to integrate with different underlying implementations. These extension points are crucial when developing cloud native application. For example, when developing a cloud native application that needs to use cloud provider’s messaging system, you may be able to avoid using implementation-specific APIs, instead, use a higher level abstraction such as Spring Integration. In this talk, we’ll what these extensions points are, how to build an extension, and how we realize the benefits in the Spring Cloud GCP project."
