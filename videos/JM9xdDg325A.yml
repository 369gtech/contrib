recordingDate: 1571144800
description: "Is it possible to kill the batch way in the Financial Industry?\n\nIndizen technologies plays a key role in the architecture and innovation team of the first Spanish bank corporate and investment banking department. During the last two years we have been working in the leading streaming platform of the area.\n\nThe goal is to change the BaaB (Batch as a batch) approach into an EaaS(Everything as a Streaming). We will discuss the problems suffered to beat the legacy dependencies to accomplish the real time first era and the main benefits of our zeta architecture implementation with Flink and Kafka being the main characters. This architecture has a lot of special features, such as the separation of technology and business using a business rule engine, the metadata evolution, real time analytics, the integration of many different projects each other using event sourcing and CQRS patterns etc.\n\nLast but not least, we will enlighten you with some particular real time use cases in order to reduce costs, operational risk and reconciliation operations learned during these years."
