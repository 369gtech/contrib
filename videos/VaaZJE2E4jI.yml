description: "Interesting things happen at the edge. All kinds of parties — internal and external, good and bad — enter your cloud or on-premises environment to call APIs and use web apps. Are you effectively deflecting attackers? Do popular APIs handle the load without degrading performance? Are apps instrumented properly to help you do real-time usage analytics? Even if you answered “yes” to those questions, it’s challenging to handle edge processing in a consistent manner across all your development teams.   Route Services are a new type of Pivotal Cloud Foundry marketplace service that developers insert into the request path for their application. These services intercept requests at the edge of PCF and help you deliver a more secure, robust environment.\n\nSpeaker: Shannon Coen, Pivotal"
