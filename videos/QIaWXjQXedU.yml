recordingDate: 1409866833
description: "A platform as a service (PaaS) is about doing more on behalf of the developer and operator. A modern PaaS must keep apps up and running in the face of failures within the system. From the onset, the Pivotal CF enterprise PaaS has been built to make both the developer and operatorâ€™s jobs easier.\n\nThe Four Levels of HA in Pivotal CF: \n- Availability Zones.\n- Health management for app instances.\n- Monitored processes.\n- Health management for virtual machines."
