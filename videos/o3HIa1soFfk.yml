description: '#Codemotion Rome 2018 - In machine learning, training large models on a massive amount of data usually improves results. Our customers report, however, that training such models and deploying them is either operationally prohibitive or outright impossible for them. We created a collection of machine learning algorithms that scale to any amount of data, including k-means clustering for data segmentation, factorization machines for recommendations, time-series forecasting, linear regression, topic modeling, and image classification. This talk will discuss those algorithms, understand where and how they can be used.'
