title: 'Internals of Android Architecture Components - Viraj Tank'
recordingDate: 1575470012
description: "Join me in this talk, where I would like to talk about the core principles of AAC, followed by Internal code structure of AAC libraries. With this knowledge, we will revisit MVVM and MVP to see how we can fully/partially integrate AAC libraries to address and fix the issues of lifecycle, configuration changes, state management and data persistence in an Android application. The goal of this talk is to provide a solid MVVM based architecture using AAC, with clean architecture, RxJava and Dagger.\n\nIn this talk, you will be learning:\n\n    Issues with view lifecycle, configuration changes, state management & data persistence.\n\n    Core principles of AAC in general and Internals of AAC libraries.\n\n    How AAC libraries help us fix the problems discussed earlier.\n\n    Should/Can you use AAC libraries with MVP, and up to what extent.\n\n    Refactoring an MVVM application to integrate AAC libraries, including AAC based utilities"
