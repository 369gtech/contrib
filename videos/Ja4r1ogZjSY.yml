description: "OWASP AppSec EU 2018 Keynote - Day 2, Morning \n\nXSS is about twenty years old by now and appears to be alive and\nkicking. JavaScript alerts are still popping left and right and bug\nbounty programs are drowning in submissions.\n\nBut is XSS really still a problem of our time? Or is it just an undead\nfoul-smelling zombie vulnerability from the dark ages of string\nconcatenation that doesn't wanna perish because we are just too fricken\nstubborn?\n\nThis talk will be an hour-long rant (yes, swearwords, leave your kids at\nhome), paired with a stroll through the history of XSS and related\nissues. We will go back into the year 1998 and see how it all started,\nhow things developed, what we tried to do against it and how hard we\nfailed every single time. We will also look at the future and predict\nwhat is about to happen next. Mostly nothing - but good to know, right?\n\nWe will not only look at our own failures but also see how the entire\ninfrastructure and monetization of the web contributed to us being\nsimply not capable or even just willing to fix XSS. And we might as well\nsee if any of those behavioral and structural patterns can be compared\nto other human failures - and see if there is something we all can\nlearn. Or, at least, agree that we knew it all along and are all on the\nsame page.\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
