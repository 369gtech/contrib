recordingDate: 1578352217
description: "This talk briefly overviews some background of Ethereum, then classifies security bugs of its smart contracts. Next, we will present the design, implementation and evaluation of a new heuristic-based solution, named ABBE, that can detect known and unknown attacks on live smart contracts by analyzing blockchain transactions and storage. To conclude, we have some cool live demo to show how ABBE can easily detect all the classical vulnerabilities and beyond. Our tool will be released afterwards, with full source code. \n\n=== \n\nNguyen Quoc Bao studied at HCMC University of Technology, majoring in Computer Science. With more than two years diving in Blockchain field, he took part in developing several blockchain projects. As a passionate member of Efiens CTF Team, he also enjoys findings bugs and conducting security research for security on Ethereum smart contracts.\n\n--- \n\nDr. Nguyen Anh Quynh is a regular speaker at numerous industrial cybersecurity conferences such as Blackhat USA/Europe/Asia, Defcon, Recon, Eusecwest, Syscan, HackInTheBox, Hack.lu, Deepsec, XCon, Confidence, Hitcon, Opcde, Shakacon, Brucon, Zeronights, Tensec, H2HC, etc. He also presented his researches in academic venues such as Usenix, IEEE, ACM, LNCS. His contribution to the filed lays foundation for various innovative works in the industry and academia. As a passionate coder, Dr. Nguyen is the founder and maintainer of several open source reversing frameworks: Capstone (http://capstone-engine.org), Unicorn (http://unicorn-engine.org) and Keystone (http://keystone-engine.org)."
