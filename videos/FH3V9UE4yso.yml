description: "Marc Sewtz\nOracle\n\nThe times, when corporations had all relevant data stored in few, large-scale enterprise databases, are over. Today’s businesses require data from many disparate data sources for decision making, analytics and day-to-day operations. To accommodate these needs, development tools must be able to interface with relational databases, non-relational data stores and REST APIs alike. In this session, we’ll show how Oracle APEX enables businesses to easily build these type of data mashups, tapping into a variety of local and public data sources. Using powerful components, such as Interactive Grids and Oracle JET-based data visualizations, developers can create comprehensive dashboards, reports and charts to meet their business user's needs."
