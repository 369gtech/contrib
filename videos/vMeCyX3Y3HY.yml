description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nThe Future is Bright, the Future is Prometheus Remote Write - Tom Wilkie, Grafana Labs\n\n\"Prometheus remote write was introduced almost 5 years ago as a way for Prometheus to send samples to external storage. Since then the protocol has been implemented by ~30 different metrics systems - and in version 2.25, Prometheus itself accepts remote write!\n\nIn this talk we'll discuss the use cases for pushing data to Prometheus via remote write - and more importantly, what it's not meant for. We'll present a more thorough specification of the protocol, and some of the future plans and what a remote write v2 might look like - streaming? metadata? exemplars?\""
