description: 'Think of provisioning information on real-life objects or straw through Cloud data like persons, related contacts, documents and other stuff.

By extending it to a 3D world, you are able to process the data in a completely different way. Think of creating teams of people within your organization and group them based on specialties, getting a more clear inside view of your site structure in SharePoint or have a 3D model of the Microsoft Graph entities related objects'
