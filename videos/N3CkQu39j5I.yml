description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2016\n—\nCurrently in the C++ Networking TS and Concurrency TS, callbacks and futures are the means for communicating an asynchronous value. However, there are disadvantages with both. Callbacks are low overhead, but hard to compose. Futures are easy to compose, but have increased overhead. In this talk we will consider channels as a third alternatives that can have lower overhead than futures while still being easy to compose.\n— \nJohn Bandela\nI first started programming in C++ at age 14 in 1994 when I cajoled my parents into buying me Visual C++ 1.0 for my birthday. It took a while, but as I learned the language, I decided I really liked C++. I attended the University of Florida and obtained my undergraduate degree in Computer and Information Science. During my undergraduate time, I created and submitted Boost.Tokenizer. I went on to medical school and neurosurgery residency, but decided to do something with a little less scary undefined behavior and returned to programming in C++.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
