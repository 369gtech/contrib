description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nSIG Multicluster Intro - Paul Morie, Red Hat & Jeremy Olmsted-Thompson, Google \n\nSIG-Multicluster is focused on solving common challenges related to the management of many Kubernetes clusters, across multiple cloud providers (so-called hybrid cloud) and applications deployed across many clusters. In the introduction, we'll give attendees an overview of the current status of the multicluster problem space in Kubernetes and of the SIG. We’ll discuss current thinking around best practices for multicluster deployments and what it means to be part of a ClusterSet. Then we’ll highlight current SIG projects, focused use cases, and ideas for what’s next. Most importantly, we’ll provide information on how you can get involved either as a contributor or as a user who wants to provide feedback about the SIG's current efforts and future direction. This session will mostly be an open dialog; attendees will have the opportunity to ask questions in person as well as leave survey responses that the SIG will use to plan next steps. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ekGj"
