description: "We hear about GraphQL as being the coolest kid in town, invented by Facebook and loved by the front-end developers.\nSome say that if you have a REST Api, you wonâ€™t need something else, but we all know that the client applications sitting in front of a REST Api tend to be a little too chatty and from over-fetching.\n\nIn this session we will talk about GraphQL over .Net, the why and what, the pros and cons of using it.\n\nWhat it brings to the table? Is it worth it? It's just another buzzword?\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks, courses, and conferences in the following links:\nhttps://ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
