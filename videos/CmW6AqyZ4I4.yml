description: "Do you remember how when you switched on your phone abroad for the first time, it popped up a message suggesting to install your operator’s network settings? Do you have any idea what these settings were, and where exactly they originated from? Could it be coming not from your network operator, but from somebody malicious instead?\n\nWe found security issues with phones by major vendors, including Samsung, Huawei, LG and Sony, which allow anybody and everybody to send network settings to these phones. A user has no way to tell what settings he is accepting, nor whether they were indeed sent by his network operator, or an imposter. With just one message like this, an attacker can take over your network traffic, mail server and other settings, putting your privacy at serious risk.\n\nThe affected vendors are currently working, each one independently, on fixes for these vulnerabilities; but their root cause is that the specifications for mobile client provisioning are rather old, and they don’t give enough attention to security aspects.\n\nOur talk will describe in detail the possible attack flows, including their live demos and a discussion of their mitigations by the vendors.\n\n=====\n\nSlava Makkaveev is a Security Researcher at Check Point. Holds a PhD in Computer Science. Slava has found himself in the security field more than eight years ago and since then gained a vast experience in reverse engineering and malware analysis. Recently Slava has taken a particularly strong interest in mobile platforms and firmware security. Slava was a speaker at DEF CON 25/26.\n\n-----\n\nArtyom Skrobov is a Security Researcher at Check Point, with a keen interest in reverse engineering and low-level hacking. Before applying his skills in the field of software security, he had been a compiler engineer at ARM and later Huawei."
