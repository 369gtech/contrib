title: 'Chrome Apps + Native Client'
recordingDate: 1355247492
description: "Did you know that you can use Native Client inside a Chrome App? Join +John Mccutchan and +Pete LePage as they introduce Native Client Acceleration Modules (NaCl AM) which expose C++ libraries to JavaScript programs. NaCl AMs can, be used for bulk data processing (compression, encryption) but they also work well in interactive applications that require low latency. We'll explain how to build a NaCl Acceleration Module and demo a Bullet Physics engine running inside a Chrome App with a NaCl AM interacting with an HTML and JavaScript UI using three.js.\n\nWe'll be live on Tuesday December 11th at at 9am PT, showing you code, samples and answering your questions."
