description: "RubyConf 2018 - Retrospectives for Humans by Courtney Eckhardt\n\nSeattle has two of the longest floating bridges in the world, and in 1990, one of them sank while it was being repurposed. This accident was a classic complex systems failure with a massive PR problem and great documentation. That combination is an excellent frame for talking about incident retrospectives- the good, the bad, the vaguely confusing and unsatisfying. Come for the interesting disaster story, stay to learn about the language of blame and how to ask warm, thoughtful engineering questions."
