title: '[VDT18] Set your code on fire with FlameGraphs by Francesco Nigro'

description: 'Currently there are several tools to analyze the behavior and performance of an application, but traditionally the way of displaying results is that of tabular, either flat or tree. In this talk we will take a peek at some alternative tool that "enlightens" the darkest corners of the behavior of our applications and the JVM, showing them in a completely new and more visual way: the FlameGraphs. During the intervention a "peek under the hood" will be given to some JVM mechanisms to understand the reasons behind the failures of most well known profilers.'
