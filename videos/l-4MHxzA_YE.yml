description: "A song of types and errors, or how I found myself leading teams of Scala developers - Valentin Kasas (Lambda Days 2017)\n\n\nhttp://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2017/valentin-kasas\n\n\n\nWorking with technologies that are not (yet) widely adopted is very exciting but can lead to disturbing side-effects. Being slightly ahead of the main adoption curve, you may end up as the most tenured expert in the room, while still feeling that you have so much yet to learn.\n\nSo how do you deal with that tension? How do you make your project succeed while still feeling you are just slightly less a noob than your coworkers?\n\nBeing a Scala developer for more than four years, I've been in that situation more than once. I had my share of successes and miserable failures, and I collected some valuable tips along the way, that I want to share with you during that presentation.\n\nI may use a few examples of Scala code during the presentation, but I feel the tips I present are not specific to Scala per se.\n\n**SPOILER ALERT** : for illustration purposes, I might use pictures taken from a famous HBO tv show (the one where beloved characters face premature death), these may constitute spoilers for people having not watched it yet."
