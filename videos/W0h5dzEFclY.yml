description: "RubyConf 2018 - Cats, The Musical! Algorithmic Song Meow-ification by Beth Haubert\n\nHow are you supposed to sing along with your favorite TV theme song every week if it doesn’t have lyrics? At my house, we “meow” along (loudly). We also code, so I built ‘Meowifier’ to convert any song into a cat’s meows. Join me in this exploration of melody analysis APIs and gratuitous cat gifs."
