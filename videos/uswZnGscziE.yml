description: "You know about DevOps, you know DevOps is right for your organization, but hey, what can you do? As an individual contributor or a team leader, your authority to transform your organization to DevOps is limited. But your influence is not!\n\nIn this webinar, Baruch will show how some proven influencing and negotiating techniques can be used to convince critical stakeholders in your organization in the necessity of DevOps.\n\nWe look at the arguments, the techniques, and the small tricks, which work in particular situations with particular engineering and business leadership positions and will prepare you to deliver the message of DevOps most convincingly to each.\n\nPresenter:\n\nBaruch Sadogursky, Head of Developer Advocacy @JFrog"
