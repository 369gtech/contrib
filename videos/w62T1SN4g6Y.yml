description: "Keynote: 2.66 Million - Cheryl Hung, Director of Ecosystem, Cloud Native Computing Foundation \n\nOver the last 4 years, Kubernetes has redefined what it means to run software. It empowers people to do more than they could do before - to ship faster, to use less resources, to understand the behaviour of thousands of applications running on tens of thousands of machines. Now the CNCF is home to 36 projects, and growing. Cheryl will share some initiatives from the CNCF to ensure a happy and healthy community. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MQUp"
