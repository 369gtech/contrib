description: "Our jobs are full of contradictions. We sometimes get caught up with finding a perfect project, that we begin to believe that we’ll be able to reach a stage where we’ll be doing amazing work and be happy all the time. Instead, it’s more realistic and attainable to find a balance in everything and be able to find joy in the struggles as well. In the end, our creative battles can be a way to move forward and become a better designer.\n\nJoyce N.
