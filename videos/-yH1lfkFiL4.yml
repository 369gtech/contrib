description: "AngularJS: making a browser a better development platform\nPar Pawel Kozlowski\n\nThis talk will familiarize you with AngularJS JavaScript framework and its revolutionary approach to writing single-page web applications. AngularJS is unique in many ways with its DOM-based, declarative templating, ability to extend HTML vocabulary and strong focus on testing. \n\nAngularJS will be introduced by contrasting it with traditional approaches and showing benefits of the AngularJS-way (extremely concise yet readable code, testability and most importantly -- making web development fun again!). This will be an interactive talk with plenty of code examples."
