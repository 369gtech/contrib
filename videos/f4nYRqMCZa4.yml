title: 'How To Setup Simple CI/CD Pipelines That Can Deploy To Kubernetes With Cloud Foundry'
language: English
recordingDate: 1614406067
description: "Being able to deploy code continuously to production is an important need for software engineering teams today. \n\nBy introducing modern elements such as Kubernetes to cloud-based infrastructure, engineering teams are facing increased complexity in setting up these CI/CD pipelines. Installing Cloud Foundry, specifically the cf-for-k8s project, provides a greatly simplified experience not only for individual developers, but for setting up CI/CD pipelines as well. Using a Cloud Foundry abstraction over Kubernetes is a step towards more efficient development and delivery of software. \n\nIn this live stream, Shedrack and Ram - developer advocates at Cloud Foundry Foundation - present two approaches. One using GitLab Runner and another using GitHub Actions. Using either approach will get you started with automating your deployments to Kubernetes. \n\n#Kubernetes #CloudFoundry #CI #CD"
