language: English
recordingDate: 1404547897
description: 'Grails standard view technology -- GSPs -- has started to feel pretty old-fashioned in recent years with the explosion of rich thick client web-apps. However, as big sites like Twitter and AirBnb have discovered, server-side view rendering has its advantages for performance, deep-linking and SEO. This talk will explore the use of templates that can be shared by server and client side code to provide a hybrid approach to view rendering in a Grails application. We''ll look at the whys and hows of a hybrid approach using a concrete example application.'
