description: "http://g.co/gtac\nSlides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pvAzl2L6X6CLdPI3IgZscZV6gCPz-n56pZ1VRRsYlZI/pub\n\nDr.Shauvik Roy Choudhary (Georgia Tech/Checkdroid)\n\nSoftware robots, such as Monkey can be used to test an android application without much manual effort. There are several such tools proposed in academia whose goal is to automatically generate test input to drive android applications. In this talk, I will introduce a set of representative test input generation tools and present a comparative study to highlight their strengths and limitations. You will learn about the internals of these tools and how you can use them to test your application. The details of the study along with a VM setup with the tools is available at: http://bear.cc.gatech.edu/~shauvik/androtest/"
