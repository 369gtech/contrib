description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nVulnerability Supply Chains - Art Manion, CERT Coordination Center\n\nIf you've analyzed or responded to software vulnerabilities like BadAlloc, KRACK, or the PROTOS SNMP test suite from 2002, then you've encountered the intersection of vulnerabilities and supply chains. Without supply chain knowledge, multi-party coordinated vulnerability disclosure efforts are largely limited to manual investigation, one-offs, and guesswork. Follow-on activities like vulnerability management and risk assessment are also hindered. To what extent are vulnerabilities in upstream dependencies inherited? What happens when build tools have or create vulnerabilities? How might we effectively perform coordinated disclosure and share supply chain knowledge at scale? What part will SBOM (software bill of materials) play?"
