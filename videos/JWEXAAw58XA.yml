title: '#include optimization with IWYU - Kim Gräsman'
recordingDate: 1386578181
description: "As C++ codebases grow larger, it gets increasingly difficult to keep track of #include dependencies. This has a number of detrimental effects including slower builds, unnecessary re-builds and fewer reuse and refactoring opportunities.\n\nInclude-what-you-use is an opinionated tool that helps optimize the #include graph to minimize these problems.\n\nSpeaker\nKim Gräsman is a developer on the\nproject and will try to explain the benefits, details and challenges of Include-what-you-use."
