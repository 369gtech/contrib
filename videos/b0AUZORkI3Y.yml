title: 'JDK IO 2016 - Ryan Cuprak - Faster Java EE Builds with Gradle'
recordingDate: 1474443312
description: 'It is time to move your Java EE builds over to Gradle! Gradle continues to gain momentum across the industry. In fact, Google is now pushing Gradle for Android development. Gradle draws on lessons learned from both Ant and Maven and is the next evolutionary step in Java build tools. This session will cover the basics of switching existing Java EE projects over to Gradle (that use Maven) and the benefits that you will reap such an incremental compiling, custom distributions, task parallelization, etc. All the goodies you''ve come to expect such as integration testing and leveraging Docker will be demoed. Switching is easier than you think and no refactoring is required.'
