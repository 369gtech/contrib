description: "In the new world of heterogeneous agile teams comes the new shockwave of the DevOps and NoOps movements. No longer is the agile team member required to be specialized according to their role, but they are expected to become a Universal Soldier of sorts, spanning their knowledge and abilities across development, application secuity, operationns, documentation and perhaps other roles as well. The Agile movement helped us remove the overspecialization at the tactical level. Now comes the time to conquer the final silos of the old world: the overspecialization of the operational team.\n\nShort Bio: Trainer, developer, project manager, technical coach, with a passion for technical teams and solutions architectures, I have more than 12 years’ experience in the engineering and management of complex software systems.\nAs a trainer I have been designing and delivering complex training programs on both technical as well as non-technical topics and have a continued preoccupation with individual as well as organizational learning and development.As a technical coach & consultant, I have been working with local and international, geographically distributed teams, employing Agile methodologies, Microservice and Serverless architectures, helping them develop and continuously improve their hybrid cloud solutions and guiding then through their digital transformation journey.I am a Computer Science alumnus of the Polytechnic University as well as the University of Bucharest, I hold a Diploma in Training Management and Organizational Learning as well as a Diploma in Software Architecture Design and Analysis from the Carnegie Mellon University and have been a speaker in various technology conferences such as DevTalks Bucharest, Agile Tour Bucharest, ISTA Sofia, etc."
