description: "Citizen Science with Python\n[EuroPython 2018 - Keynote - 2018-07-27 - Smarkets]\n[Edinburgh, UK]\n\nBy Ian Ozsvald\n\nYou could make a difference in the world with a little science and Python. We'll look at several data-driven humanitarian and healthcare projects developed using Python and, all going well, run some audience experiments. By the end of the talk I hope you'll be looking to run your own experiments with the scientific Python stack.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2018.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
