description: "DevConf - The Software Craftsmen Festival for Sharing Knowledge and Inspiration (https://devconf.pl/)\n\nCallum will share the process followed and challenges faced from incrementally rewriting a large monolithic medical system (used by the NHS and other global health institutions) into a majestically constructed microservices architecture.\n\nHe’ll discuss how the team identified, prioritised and replaced key components of an existing application as independent services; the difficulty but importance of refactoring the legacy codebase to be event oriented, methods used to effectively “strangle” parts of the live system as they were replaced, and what the team needed to do to rapidly scale up a creaking system against a tight Christmas deadline…\n\nHe will also take a look at the infrastructure components used to quickly get a large microservices system up and running, focusing on utilising Azure Functions and API Management Gateway, and touch upon the learning curve that working with these unfamiliar technologies had on the growing team."
