description: "DevOpsDays Baltimore 2019 - Ignite: Creative Solutions to Already Solved Problems II by Ignite: Gene Gotimer\n\nAlmost everyone has to deal with bad legacy code at some point. Not just legacy code that you inherited and obviously would have been better if you had written it, but legacy code so ugly and ill-conceived that it makes you want to hunt down the person responsible just so you can scream at them (or worse). And then replace it with a one-line library function that does the same thing.\n\nGene will show some examples of the worst code he has seen and we'll all have a chuckle or a groan- pure schadenfreude. The names, projects, and check-in comments have been changed to protect the guilty.\n\n#confreaks #devopsdaysbmore"
