recordingDate: 1489579509
description: "http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2017/vincenzo-chianese\n\nAs of today, we have multiple ways to handle the concurrency in Javascript: callbacks, Promises, co-generators, async await keywords, reactive streams, you name it.\n\nAs our codebase is evolving, multiple solutions might have been employed at the same time. What if we could tame all these in a single abstraction?\n\nInspired by jlongster.com/Taming-the-Asynchronous-Beast-with-CSP-in-JavaScript, Iâ€™ll show you the concept of CSP channels, showing you the benefits of a single solution, practical usages as well eventual pain points you might encounter during their usage."
