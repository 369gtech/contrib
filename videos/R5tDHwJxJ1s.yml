description: "Join Olaf Gradin from Fiserv for an uncommon perspective on DevOps. Before Fiserv acquired Checkfree a decade ago, the IT team built a platform for Checkfree’s Windows/.NET apps that changed the way developers and operators worked together. Today at Fiserv, this system has evolved but is still in production operation. Recently, Fiserv adopted the Pivotal Application Service (PAS) to run its mission critical applications, and is actively migrating Windows/.NET & Linux apps to PAS-W. Whether you are building platform parts yourself, or buying from a vendor, what we’ve learned at Fiserv about both can help you. Let’s talk about what worked and what didn’t across different groups & projects: some waterfall, some agile, some ITIL / ticket systems - others using full automation / APIs. The developers and operations at Fiserv have encompassed a lot on the journey, and come together in new ways.\n\nSeptember 25, 2018\n3:20 pm - 3:50 pm\nNational Harbor 10-11\n\nSpeakers\nOlaf Gradin\nPrincipal Platform Architect, Fiserv\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
