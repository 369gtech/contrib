description: "Machine Learning Foundations is a free training course where you’ll learn the fundamentals of building machine learned models using TensorFlow.\n\nIn Episode 7 we’ll look at how we can use image augmentation as a technique to artificially extend your datasets to provide new information for the training of your neural network. This can potentially help you with overfitting issues!\n\nImage augmentation example → https://goo.gle/2AKkIzX\n\nTensorFlow is Google’s end-to-end open source machine learning platform.
