Мне с тобою хорошо» \n8 октября, 16:00  \n\nТезисы и презентация:\nhttp://appsconf.ru/2018/abstracts/3629\n\nAccessibility is a very important topic, that is often overlooked or, at best, added as an after-thought. This is very unfortunate, as Apple is doing a great job at providing good and simple to use APIs to make our apps accessible. Apple is fully committed to Accessibility and in providing an equal user experience for all their users, and so should we. The goal of this talk is to give an in-depth look at Accessibility on iOS, as well as outlining the reasons on why to use Accessibility by giving real-world examples of its importance.\n--------\nНашли ошибку в видео?
