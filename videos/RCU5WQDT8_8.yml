description: "Lambda Days turns 5 this year!\n\n\nNever-failing explosion of enthusiasm and talent is what gets us motivated to explore this amazing community in all of its potential. A journey we take through different ideas, technologies, paradigms and languages inspires creativity, growth and pure enjoyment of coding.\n\nTo us Scala, Erlang, Haskell, Elixir, F#, Lisp, Clojure, OCaml and many other emerging technologies are more than languages - they are new perspectives on how to understand and tackle challenges of every day work.\n\n\nRegister to Lambda Days newsletter to receive updates: http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2018/#contact"
