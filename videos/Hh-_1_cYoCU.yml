description: "This presentation was recorded at Voxxed Days Belgrade 2016 - https://belgrade.voxxeddays.com/\n\nFog Computing is a term gaining acceptance to stand for a new type of network and application architecture going beyond the centralized and distributed approaches. It represents a network where the smartness is not only in one of the edges, but rather on both edges. This turns the dumb client and smart server concept on its head."
