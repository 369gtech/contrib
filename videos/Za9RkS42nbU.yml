description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nZero Database Downtime with etcd-operator - Tyler Lisowski & Kodie Glosser, IBM \n\nZero downtime upgrades, multi availability zone redundancy, automatic instance recovery, periodic backups, and restores in the case of disaster scenarios are all possible when you automate etcd operations with the Etcd-operator. This talk will walk through a live example of a multi availability zone etcd cluster managed by Etcd-operator and how Etcd-operator automates database administration tasks. We will visually step through how these operations are executed by Etcd-operator and how attendees can integrate it into their existing architectures to eliminate downtime and drastically reduce the time they spend on database administration tasks.\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zeqj"
