description: "Customers care more and more about their privacy. People start to worry about their data and how big companies are using it. Decentralized Machine Learning helps conciliating the need for company to use customer data to stay competitive and the privacy awareness that their customers might have. This new paradigm uses data directly on the device and doesn’t need any data extraction. We will be reviewing how we can train accurate model without never having to get the data from outside the smartphone of a user and how it can power companies decisions and machine learning product. We will go through different concepts like Federated Learning or Secure Aggregation protocol. And we will talk about the pros and cons of using this method against having the data directly in a company server.\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
