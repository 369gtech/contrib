title: 'Experiences from using discovery services in a microservice landscape - Magnus Larsson @ Spring I/O'
language: English
recordingDate: 1499429240
description: "Spring I/O 2017 - 18 -19 May, Barcelona\n\nOne of the most important components in a microservice landscape is the discovery service. During the last few years a large number of alternatives for service discovery have evolved, specifically in the area of container infrastructures.\n\nThis presentation will, based on my experiences, go through some of the alternatives. The presentation will cover discovery service components in Netflix OSS, Docker Swarm, Amazon ECS and Google Kubernetes. We will also cover how to use Spring Cloud to write microservices that are independent of the selected discovery service, i.e. that can be used with any of the alternatives without requiring modifications of the code."
