title: 'Declarative Deep Learning In Clojure -'
language: English
recordingDate: 1507996590
description: 'Deeplearning4j is the best option for creating deep learning models via the JVM. Creator Adam Gibson and the open source community that sprung up around him have dedicated years to creating a commercial-grade, distributed and production ready ecosystem of libraries specifically designed to tackle the challenges of creating deep learning applications. This talk is about bringing all of their hard work to the clojure community via a declarative wrapper that combines the luxuries of clojure with the power of DL4J.'
