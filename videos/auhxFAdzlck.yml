description: "by Jean-Pierre Rosen\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/AW1.125/ada_safety.webm\n\n\nWe are (too much) used to software having bugs as an unavoidable fate. But for safety-critical software, like the code that's driving planes or trains, \"Failure is Not an Option\". This presentation exposes the constraints of such software, and how they require a special state of mind, special methods, and special tools - like Ada and SPARK. And these can be useful for more casual programming - zero bug software is nice, even when not safety-critical! \n\nRoom: AW1.125\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 15:30:00+01"
