description: "No organization ever complained that their It department was delivering too fast. However, as technologies evolve ever more quickly and product cycle times keep shorting, it’s difficult for any development team or IT organization to be fast enough.\n\nAs these organizations try many things to move faster, from adopting Lean and Devops approaches, moving to the cloud, to working weekends or paying bigger bonuses. Slowly many of them realize that increasing velocity is about more than just moving a bit faster. It takes a fundamentally different mindset – one that looks at the first derivative.\n\nThis talk takes a fresh look why moving faster isn’t just about speeding things up and dissects both systems and organizational architectures that are built for economies of speed."
