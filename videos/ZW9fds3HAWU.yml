After having learned many languages, she ended up thinking that we've barely scratched the surface of the programming language design space. These days she's exploring what FP can do for industrial control systems frontends, using Erlang, and Purescript.\n\nAdam Lindberg\nSenior software development professional. Experience with distributed architecture, cloud infrastructure, live operations and embedded systems. Focus on dynamic languages, test driven development and agile methods. Author of Meck, an open source mocking framework for Erlang.\n\nVisualizing Home Automation with GRiSP\n\nWe present a GRiSP home automation project written in Erlang and JavaScript/D3.\nIt is one of many potential applications for GRiSP platform, a bare metal board supporting Erlang and Elixir.\nTogether with sensors and actuators useful for smart homes, a proof-of-concept home automation hub is built.\nWe demo the project, show how we implemented it on GRiSP, how to connect to sensors and visualize data coming from sensors through D3 and JavaScript from a web interface.\n\nhttp://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2018/claudia-doppioslash"
