While OpenSocial version 0.7 is being rolled out on several large social networking sites, the specification is evolving to include more features useful to social application developers.\r\n\r\nThis session will cover the most interesting features that are discussed in the specification working group to be included in the next versions of OpenSocial, like an OpenSocial template language, and the OpenSocial RESTful API."
