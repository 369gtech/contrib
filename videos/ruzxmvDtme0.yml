title: 'Ludovic Champenois & Mandy Waite - Cloud Platform end to end: How we built ''Cloud Spin'''
recordingDate: 1445386397
description: 'The Cloud is useful for a lot of cool things, well how about taking 19 smartphones and wiring them together in order to take 3D pictures of people doing crazy stuff at events? Guess what? that''s exactly what we did! Our only limitation was that being Google we had to use Google Cloud Platform and it turns out that that''s not much of a limitation at all. This talk looks at how we built the backend and analyzes the design choices that we made when it comes to endpoints, messaging, storage, scalability, Docker, Firebase and process pipelines. Best of all it answers the question: How do you wire up 19 smartphones to the Cloud and use them to create 3D pictures?'
