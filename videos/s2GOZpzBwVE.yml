description: "With several years of passionate Scala programming under his belt, Will Sargent shows us some strategies for smartly using the Play Framework. What is possible in Play that is dubious, or even impossible, using other languages?\n\nProcessing commands, query practices, streaming, and some information on what Play can and cannot do are all touched on in this broadly scoped talk. In addition to delivering a nice overview of the diverse options inside Play, Will also explains how it can directly benefit you as a developer of websites.\n\n**We offer trainings to help you learn Play with Scala!: http://ow.ly/kPILh\n**Follow along with Will's slides here: http://mrkn.co/46lst"
