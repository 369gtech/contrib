language: English
recordingDate: 1474490843
description: 'In the modern world, where apps consist of microservices and are deployed in a cloud, developers are facing many issues related to apps config. How to deploy an app in different environments without cracking its package. How to apply configuration for deployed instances of an app without redeployment. How an app can be notified if some configuration properties changes. This session introduces a standardization effort tasked with solving these problems by defining a Java EE config service. Such a service is aimed at the cloud and provides the ability to create one or more configurations that are independent of and decoupled from apps using them. The session describes how such a service fits into the Java EE family and integrates with other Java EE frameworks.'
