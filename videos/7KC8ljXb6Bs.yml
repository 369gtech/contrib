description: "with Quentin Adam\n\nEverybody is now using virtualization, containers are all the rage today, and microkernels start to gain traction… But how is all this working? How did these solutions come to be? What are the differences between containers and virtual machines? Where and why should you use docker, runc, rocket, kvm, xen, virtualbox, includeOS, rancherOS? This talk is a full session providing understanding on how these technologies work, how they compare to each other, and lot’s of demo to understand differences and fundamental concept on isolation. So, let’s look under the hood, and understand how your system works (hint: it’s not magic). And yes, it will be understandable even if you are not an OPS or an expert. That’s precisely the point.\n\nThe idea of this talk is lead by many major confusion around linux since the docker hype, things like “a container is a light VM” and other misunderstanding of low levels of the OS. This talk purpose is to provide some knowledge on this topics to everyone, help them choosing tools, architecture or solve their scaling or security issue."
