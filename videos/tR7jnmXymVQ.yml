description: "It takes months to update everything in a software stack. This session provides an overview of that process based on real-world experience, including how to talk with all the stakeholders involved and how to split a monolith from an architectural/deployment point of view. Topics covered include how to manage people unaware of (or denying) existing and future issues, those with only superficial or no knowledge of those “alien” tools, vLANs issues, servers not connected to any network, and people asking for Docker images for everything. Recommended for system administrators, developers, and DevOps.\n\nSpeaker: Davide Fiorentino"
