description: "Debugging JavaScript can drive developers crazy. It’s not surprising when so many us stick to the trusty console.log - but there are better ways. From debugging a critical issue in production, to simply struggling to add a new feature and not realising you’ve misread some documentation… We use a similar process and set of skills in these types of situations. But the sad fact is, we’re often too stressed or busy to think about how to improve those skills and really take advantage of the different tools and techniques available to us. This talk will both explore how we can improve on that process and show you some really handy techniques that can get you out of a bind quickly.\n\nEVENT:\n\nAmsterdamJS Meetup, 2017\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nRebecca Hill\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nAmsterdamJS Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nAmsterdamJS: https://amsterdamjs.com/"
