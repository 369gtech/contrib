description: 'Lean has been applied as a toolkit to fine-tune development processes and organisational workflow, but what does it mean when we apply the practices to the detail of the code, the practices used to develop it and the people who develop it? What does Lean Code and its creation look like? There is a need to move beyond often separated worlds of software craft and agile development, to properly embrace code in its detail, but to also connect it more completely to the flow of business and the intelligence of people around it. To move beyond simple exhortations of clean code to something more human. This talk offers a fresh look at Lean principles and practices from the perspective of the code and the coder, rather than the usual scale of the organisation and the development process.'
