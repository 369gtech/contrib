description: "SelectiveEC: Selective Reconstruction in Erasure-coded Storage Systems\n\nLiangliang Xu, Min Lyu, Qiliang Li, Lingjiang Xie, and Yinlong Xu, University of Science and Technology of China\n\nErasure coding has been a commonly used approach to provide high reliability with low storage cost. But the skewed load in a recovery batch severely slows down the failure recovery process in storage systems. To this end, we propose a balanced scheduling module, SelectiveEC, which schedules reconstruction tasks out of order by dynamically selecting some stripes to be reconstructed into a batch and selecting source nodes and replacement nodes for each reconstruction task. So it achieves balanced network recovery traffic, computing resources and disk I/Os against single node failure in erasure-coded storage systems. Compared with conventional random reconstruction, SelectiveEC increases the parallelism of recovery process up to 106% and averagely bigger than 97% in our simulation. Therefore, SelectiveEC not only speeds up recovery process, but also reduces the interference of failure recovery with the front-end applications.\n\nView the full HotStorage '20 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/hotstorage20/workshop-program"
