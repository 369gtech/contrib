language: French

description: "ðŸ—£Steve Klabnik\n\nA lot of things have been said about WebAssembly inside of the browser; after all, thatâ€™s why it was originally created. But a new case is emerging as well, and thatâ€™s WebAssembly on the server. More specifically, weâ€™re seeing a rise of support for WebAssembly in serverless application platforms, combining two brand-new technologies together. Weâ€™re also seeing a lot of growth of the Rust programming language, and its close alignment with WebAssembly. In this talk, Steve will talk about Rust, WebAssembly, serverless technologies, and how it all fits together."
