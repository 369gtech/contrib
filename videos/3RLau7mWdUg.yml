description: 'Compressor Head, EP1 (http://goo.gl/JikCcV) introduced us all to Variable Length Codes, but didn''t have the full amount of time to talk about their practical modern use. See, most data streams aren''t so well behaved that a single VLC algorithm works for the entire data set. (incase you''ve been wondering why your compression algorithm isn''t that effective...) In this episode, +Colt McAnlis talks about how to create a Dynamic version of statistical encoding that changes and updates it''s coding based upon the behavior of the stream, as your encoding it. And +Joanna Smith is here too, just to make sure that he doesn''t leave anything out this time.'
