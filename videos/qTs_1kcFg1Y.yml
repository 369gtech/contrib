recordingDate: 1494275983
description: "Tyler Jewell - California, Codenvy\n\nWe are witnessing the death of localhost and the rise of cloud development. Developing in the cloud provides one-click environments, better team onboarding and collaboration, and workspace platforms that improve agile workflows. Eclipse Che - a developer workspace server and next-generation Eclipse IDE - is the leading platform of this movement. It's gathered 4000 GitHub stars, 25K downloads / week, and 100 contributors from Codenvy, Docker, Red Hat, Microsoft, IBM, Bitnami, Samsung, SAP, and Software AG. We'll discuss the market drive to cloud development, the battle with IT over root, and why containers are displacing Vagrant as defacto developer environments. We'll also discuss the Che community and how its community are distributing workspaces to modernize agile."
