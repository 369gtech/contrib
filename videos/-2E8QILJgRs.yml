description: "The Monotype® foundry, part of Monotype Imaging, is home to the Monotype Library of typefaces. The history surrounding the Monotype foundry dates back to the Lanston Monotype Machine Company, which pioneered mechanical typesetting in the 1880s. From typefaces such as the Times New Roman® family designed originally for The Times newspaper of London in the 1930s, to corporate identities created recently for companies such as Barclays, Monotype fonts have helped to create various recognizable brands.\r\n\r\nToday, as Monotype Imaging, we license typographic solutions to consumer electronics device manufacturers, independent software vendors, creative professionals and leading corporations worldwide. We also provide solutions for software applications and operating systems. Our e-commerce Web sites, Fonts.com™, Linotype.com, ITCFonts,com and Faces.co.uk allow you to download and license thousands of fonts. Our Fontwise® solution helps companies and agencies stay legal by managing their font licences.\r\n\r\nAlthough names have changed and technologies have evolved over the years, Monotype Imaging represents a rich history of typographic innovations and design and is recognized today as a global leader in text imaging solutions."
