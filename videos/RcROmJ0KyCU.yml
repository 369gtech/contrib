description: "Security testing is often seen as a mysterious and foreboding domain, where people enshrouded in hooded masks wield mystical powers to influence technology in ways that should be impossible. Vulnerabilities, hacks, disclosures, exploits and other spooky concepts seem to be the primary powers in this dark digital Mordor.\n\nBut we need not treat these rumours as fact, and in this talk we will not only explore and demystify these concepts, but we will also map them to the foundational concepts of testing in a way that enables everyone to begin comfortably integrating security into their existing workflow and knowledge base. Not only that, but we will even take it one step further and learn how to use simple and freely available security testing tools to enhance our existing test actions and strategies.\n\nThis presentation is OS agnostic and welcomes all web application software platforms."
