title: 'Veronika Pistyur: Why Think in at Least 15 Years if You Are a Conscious Business Player? at Stretch'
recordingDate: 1582182009
description: "The story of Bridge Budapest could tell us why some startup founders decided to deal with their frustration to influence the business environment of Hungary. When they launched the initiative defeatism, cynicism described the thinking around entrepreneurs, and people did not have the belief that they could influence their life and build global companies from a tiny place in the middle of Europe. Bridge Budapest's cofounders thought that if they want to live in a competitive country, being able to build global companies from scratch, they have to share their stories first. Then build a conscious business community with a vision to influence an environment where self-confidence is based on knowledge and performance and not only relations matter. In Hungary, it's still not evident and visible. The change of the regime took place in 1989, but the transformation of the mindset is still on its way.\n\nThe community has attracted already 1000 conscious business players who act like that it matters if they think value-driven and long-term. Now their challenge is to convince more and more business players to have a vision and take at least 15 years of responsibility for their decisions. How can an NGO create a business advantage for its members and how this advantage grows business?\n\nStretch is a non-profit leadership and management conference that brings 500 attendees and 16 speakers from all around the world who want to build effective organizations since 2013. An international platform and community for leaders and managers to share stories, hands-on solutions and explore new trends and ideas to lead, fail, learn and stretch.
