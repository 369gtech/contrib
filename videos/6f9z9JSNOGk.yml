description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nThe Great Cardinality Disasters of Our Time - Bryan Boreham, Weaveworks & Chris Marchbanks, Splunk \n\nMany Cloud Native tools generate Prometheus metrics; together they form a great combination to operate and monitor your infrastructure. But sometimes things go wrong: a quirk in the metric labels can make the volume of data explode, and, soon after, your Prometheus will explode too.  Chris and Bryan will share their war-stories such as receiving 46,000 simultaneous alerts or squashing the source of 100kB label values. Then, they will provide top tips to avoid this happening to your tools in the future. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Uadv"
