description: "Running a private container image registry has been a staple in many enterprise environments for years. These registries allow full control over access, updates, and the software platform itself. And while your organization may have an official image registry, having your own can also be a benefit!\n\nJoin Paul as he installs Harbor by following the VMware Tanzu Developer Center Guide.\n\nhttps://tanzu.vmware.com/developer/guides/kubernetes/harbor-gs/\n\n---\n\nPaul Czarkowski is a long-time practitioner of the dark arts of DevOps. Hailing from Australia, he moved to Austin,Texas to help build and run one of the largest and most successful online games. Now at VMware, Paul works to improve the operator experience by taking cloud native software development concepts and applying them to operations to create platforms that reduce toil and improve software delivery."
