recordingDate: 1612915554
description: "Last week on Learn with Dr. G, we introduced Git and talked about the importance of version control, how to create a new project, and how to make and track changes. Next, we'll explore how Git shines when used collaboratively. We'll walk through cloning a repo, making a pull request, stash your changes and then push your changes out to the rest of your team. This session is a continuation of our mini series, what you didn't learn in school. Where we explore all the tips and tricks about development that is often missed in formal education.\n\nResources:\nhttps://aka.ms/LearnWithDrG/CollaborateWithGit11"
