title: 'Kubernetes Runtime Security with Falco and Sysdig'
language: English
recordingDate: 1577495811
description: "As DevOps teams ramp Kubernetes in production, their responsibilities expand beyond monitoring, capacity management and troubleshooting to include security and compliance. Teams are looking to merge these two functions into a single secure DevOps workflow. It's time to think about runtime security and compliance requirements in the context of cloud native platforms.\n\nIn this talk, you will learn about detecting abnormal behavior and validate compliance in your running Kubernetes workloads using Falco, a CNCF project for runtime security. You will also learn how Sysdig Secure extends the Falco detection engine, offering the industry's first K8s-native threat prevention and incident response tool."
