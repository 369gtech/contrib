description: "Slides and more info:http://www.erlang-factory.com/euc2016/kenji-rikitake\n\nLegacy \"random\" module is deprecated in Erlang/OTP Release 19, and will be removed from the Release 20. Erlang developers are supposed to use \"rand\" module as the primary Pseudo Random Number Generators (PRNGs), available from Release 18. Kenji describes the details in the brief history of Erlang/OTP PRNGs and how to migrate to the newer algorithms including those of \"rand\" module, with showing their advantages and limitations.\n\nTalk objectives:\n\n* Show the general information of when and how to choose a specific PRNG algorithm\n\n* Show the pitfalls on using PRNGs and how to avoid them on Erlang\n\n* Show the advantages and limitations of newer algorithms in \"rand\" module\n\n* Show the practical use cases of PRNGs, focusing on concurrency and parallelism\n\nTarget audience:\n\nProgrammers interested in Erlang library internals, and the users intending to apply Erlang for simulation and modelling."
