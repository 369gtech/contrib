To be honest some of it is true but they have other qualities that make them excellent developers.\n\nThere A lot of misconceptions about dyslexia. Did you know that approximately 2 out of 10 persons are dyslexic? and 6 out of 10 do not even know it or are trying to hide it?\n\nAfter a short introduction on what dyslexia actually is I will present you with some interesting facts that you probably did not know. From there on I take you on a ride into the mind of a dyslexic. His reading skills, the problems he faces and more important their perception of the world. The way that we perceive the world allows us to have a different look at anything we encounter. This different look is sometimes referred to as thinking outside the box.\n\nAt the end of the presentation, I hope that I reframed this perceived weakness as being a powerful tool. And some pointers on how to interact with us, it is not that different from any other person.\n\n \nPieter Van Der Meer \nFrom Dataworkz\nBigData hacker,\n\nPassionate developer/engineer in BigData environments. Current active at the Port of Rotterdam and enabling them to become the smartest harbor in the world.\n\nBeing a dyslexic person it is almost impossible for me to think inside the box. The visual representation I create in my head makes it possible to communicate my ideas by means of drawings and pictures allowing multiple levels to connect to my train of thought."
