description: "This session’s speaker has this to say about the presentation:  Although I am best known as a Java evangelist, my day job prior to joining Oracle was as a chief agile methodologist and I facilitated three companywide agile rollouts. If you are skeptical when folks try to sell you certifications, frustrated with the institution of new processes and tracking systems, or wary of process experts taking the place of technical leadership, this is the session for you. Come learn the insider secrets of how agile works in a large enterprise from someone who has been in the eye of the hurricane. However, be forewarned that this knowledge will give you the power to change the development culture in your organization, for better or worse. Are you ready to shoulder this responsibility? \n\n\nAuthor:\nStephen Chin\nStephen Chin is a technical expert in RIA technologies, and Chief Agile Methodologist at GXS.
