An amazing weekend on APRIL 29-30, 2017 – MALLORCA, SPAIN will take you out of the office into a seaside event full of professional lectures, technical sessions, beach games, umbrella drinks, and wonderful sunset. #buildstuffes #beachconference #code www.buildstuff.es\n\nAlberto Brandolini is a 360° consultant in the Information Technology field. Asserting that problems cannot be solved with the same mindset that originated them, Alberto switches perspective frequently assuming the architect, mentor, coach, manager or developer point of view.\nHe’s a frequent speaker in software development related conferences in Italy and across Europe, since rumors spread about his funny attitude.\nHe’s also the founder of the Italian Domain-Driven Design community and of the Italian Stoos Satellite, and actively participates in debates about agile software development, lean management and new ways for entrepreneurship and collaboration."
