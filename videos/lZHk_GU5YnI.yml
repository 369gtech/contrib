description: "Drupal’s authentication process can be expensive and difficult to scale. What do you do when you need to plan for an unknown but large number of authenticated users?\n\nThis presentation will show you how to allow Drupal to work with lots of authenticated users without taking down servers. We'll walk you through\_how we used an approach called stateless (sessionless) authentication with wholefoodsmarket.com to avoid database calls and the ways we are storing PII user data outside of Drupal.\n\nWhat’s Covered?\n\nWhy scaling authenticated traffic is hard?\nWhat is sessionless auth?\nHow can you use it to manage a single login to multiple sites, e.g. D7/D8?\nWorking with an external auth provider (e.g. Janrain)\nPIIaaS! \_Storing and serving Personally Identifiable Information as a Service\nProxying web-service calls - don’t do it!\nHow to delegate oauth tokens so your browsers connect to APIs directly\nFor Whom?\n\nEnterprise architects looking for ways to build scalable authenticated experiences with Drupal.\nDevelopers looking for authentication approaches that sign you in once but allow you to be authenticated in multiple places."
