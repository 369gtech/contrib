description: "We’ve all been there. We need to bring a bottle of wine to a party but don’t want to spend too much.   Ever just want an “algorithm in the Cloud” help you pick out a good wine for a fair price? \n\nThis demo and presentation walks you through the process showing using both SQL Developer’s Oracle Data Miner “drag and drop” UI and the new Oracle Machine Learning notebooks.  We import our data, explore our wines, build machine learning models, apply the models and then, most importantly, start to select a good bottle of wine! \n\nWe then begin using Oracle Applications Express (APEX) and query and investigate OML’s insights and predictions in the Database using APEX’s powerful and easy to use query, reporting and graphing features.   \n\nSo, sit back, grab a glass of fine wine and learn some practical and fun Oracle Machine Learning and Oracle APEX tips.\n\nAskTOM Office Hours offers free, monthly training and tips on how to make the most of Oracle Database, from Oracle product managers, developers and evangelists.\n\nhttps://asktom.oracle.com/\n\nOracle Developers portal: https://developer.oracle.com/\nSign up for an Oracle Cloud trial: https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/tryit"
