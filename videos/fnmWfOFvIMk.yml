description: "Erlang User Conference 2013\nMore info and slides on the website: http://www.erlang-factory.com/conference/ErlangUserConference2013/talks \n\nOne of the highlighted features of Erlang/OTP R15B02, released on September 2012, was a parallel version of Dialyzer, the standard static analysis tool for Erlang developers, which is now shown to scale almost linearly at least up to twelve cores. Together with other improvements also included in that release, the parallel Dialyzer is able to analyze the entire Erlang/OTP codebase in just 6 minutes. In this talk I will describe the patterns that were used to parallelize this sequential tool and derive useful lessons for writing similar parallel applications in Erlang."
