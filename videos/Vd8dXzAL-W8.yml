description: "From OSCON 2014: Beth Flanagan's keynote talk, \"Yes, Your Refrigerator Is Trying To Kill You: Bad Actors and the Internet of Things.\" Remember Heartbleed? Remember how everyone spent days checking if their bank/email/favorite shopping sites had been patched?\n\nWhat about their home appliances? Light bulbs? Smart meters?\n\nAs more and more atypical devices are internet enabled, operating system providers need to look at the longer term impacts and plan accordingly. How can CE manufactures keep devices up to date and secure over the lifetime of the device. What does it look like when we fail to plan to do so? How can the open source way solve some of these problems.\n\nAbout Beth Flanagan (Intel Corp.):\nBeth ‘pidge’ Flanagan is a Senior Software Engineer with Intel’s Opensource Technology Center. She spends most of her work life hacking on OpenEmbedded and the Yocto Project. She is the release engineer for the Yocto Project, maintainer of the yocto-autobuilder and pilot of the Yocto Blimp.\n\nWatch more from OSCON, O'Reilly's open source convention: http://goo.gl/HlGwvP\nFind out more about the convention: http://oscon.com\n\nDon't miss an upload!
