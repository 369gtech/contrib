description: "About the talk:\nUX and Content Design were scheduled at opposite ends of the 9-12 month-long project timeline for the new Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) online process. There was no formal plan for them to overlap and work directly together. We took it upon ourselves to pool our skills. We put together a few tips gathered from how we worked together.\n\nAbout the speakers:\nFelice Hawley – Content Designer / Strategist and Editorial Trainer currently at Transport for London, Webcredible, ISOC and Episerver. Previously at CNN.\n\nRosina Digne-Malcolm – UX Designer at Transport for London.\n\nAbout the conference:\nDesign conference that’s not about buzzwords, but collaboration between designers. Our 5th User Experience design conference on March 2020 was themed around how UX, UI, content and graphic designers can work together better. \n\nWe've had insightful talks on day 1 and hands-on workshops on day 2 by speakers with experience working in Transport for London, OpenTable, The Paciello Group, Nike, Government Digital Service, Airbnb, Shopify, InVision, DuckDuckGo and others. From A/B Testing and Content Design to Design Language Systems and Ethical design.\n \nThe event was organised by The School of UX and kindly supported by SumUp and Sketch.
