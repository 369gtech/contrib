description: "BDD can often seem like an exclusive club for testers and developers, but for it to be successful on a project, it needs to be embraced by the whole team. This is a talk about the importance of collaboration and how everyone, in every discipline, can and should get involved in the BDD process.\n\nNarges Jalali is a Senior Product Designer – and occasional Product Lead @ustwo – with a passion for collaboration, improving ways of working and multi-disciplinary team environments. @NargesJalali on Twitter."
