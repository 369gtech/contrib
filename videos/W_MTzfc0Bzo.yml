description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nA Tall Tale of GitOps - Prasanjit Singh, Starzplay\n\nIn 1962, in his book “Profiles of the Future: An Inquiry into the Limits of the Possible”, science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke formulated his famous Three Laws, of which the third law is the best-known and most widely cited: “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic”. This quote is the seed of the session \"A Tall Tale of GitOps!\" It is a 'Tall Tale' because it is nothing short of that! What GitOps can do is larger-than-life and the session will see it unfold.\n\nWe will also share a repository of \"Awesome GitOps\" resources that you can use for hands-on demonstration about how one can write code, build it, create infrastructure, deploy the application and monitor the application all from a git version control push! The talk is focussed at beginners and will introduce the concept of GitOps and explain the building blocks of the architecture with a fictional story analogy."
