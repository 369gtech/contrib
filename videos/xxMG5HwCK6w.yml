description: "Cheat Sheet : https://goo.gl/xD2YLo\nBest C++ Book : https://amzn.to/2IX5veu\nhttps://www.patreon.com/derekbanas\n\nIn this part of my C++ tutorial we'll cover numerous ways to interact with Strings, numerous common Math functions and we'll solve a rather complex 2 part problem. The goal of this series is to teach the syntax of the C++ language while actually teaching how to solve problems using C++. Each tutorial includes increasingly more complex problems for you to solve."
