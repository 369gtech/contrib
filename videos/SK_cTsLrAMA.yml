description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTOpia November 2020. #GOTOcon #GOTOpia\nhttp://gotopia.eu\n\nKresten Krab Thorup - CTO at Humio\n\nORIGINAL TALK TITLE\nLog Analytics to the Rescue — Understanding Complex Systems at Scale\n\nABSTRACT\nIn today’s complex deployment environment, our systems are increasingly more difficult to understand. When “the system” is a composite distributed system using cloud technologies and micro services, things happen everywhere and it’s difficult to get a feel for the system as a whole.\nWith this distributed deployment, fixing system issues is inherently problematic and a simple, scalable solution is critical. During this talk, Kresten will discuss the importance of having the capability to understand, monitor, and debug complex systems using log analytics in real-time and at a massive scale. Kresten will also cover how Humio is used to support and develop Humio — itself a distributed system at scale — and how the architecture is radically different [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n00:55 How did I end up here?\n14:27 Demo: What is Humio?\n17:27 How does it work?\n31:35 Some lessons learned\n38:00 Outro\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotopia.eu/november-2020/sessions/1655/log-analytics-to-the-rescue-%E2%80%94-understanding-complex-systems-at-scale\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#Humio #Logs #Analytics #Complexity #ComplexSystems #Observability #Logging\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
