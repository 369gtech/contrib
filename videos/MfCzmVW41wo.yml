title: '"Evident Code, at Scale" by Stuart Halloway (2012)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1616211207
description: "According to Webster, evident means \"clear to the vision or understanding.\" In this talk, I will present specific practices that you can apply to make your code more evident, particularly on larger projects.\n\nIt is relatively easy to make toy-sized programs evident, but the exciting aspect of these ideas is their application at scale. I will share insights from my own experience applying these practices on a multi-year product effort undertaken in Clojure.\n\nStuart Halloway\nhttps://twitter.com/stuarthalloway\n\nStuart is the author of Programming Clojure. He advises the Clojure/core team on matters of training and practical development with Clojure."
