description: "More: https://berlinbuzzwords.de/session/commercial-search-owned-search\n\nCarrefour started the journey of digital transformation 6 years ago, transforming the e-commerce business into an omnichannel business using an “all in one” e-commerce platform where Search was one more piece of the puzzle.\n\nIn time, Carrefour technical team realized that through an open and flexible Search solution, the e-commerce platform could be constructed around it, making Search (and Navigation) the core as opposed to an add-on or an element on the periphery.\n\nThis approach, at first, implied several challenges, from strategic to technical ones:\n\nWhat options do we have? Use a SaaS solution, build a search from scratch, Base our search in an existing solution, Look for a partner to help us to build it… \n\nHow can we keep the intellectual property and the know-how inside the company?\n\_\nWhat experience do we want to offer to our customers?\n\_\nHow can we deal with a huge assortment of products from different natures and stores? \n\nWhat insights do we expect to take form the search to help our business?\n\_\nHow do we know whether the search is performing well?\n\_\nWhat strategy do we have to follow for replacement the old search engine keeping, at the same time, the rest of the “all in one” e-commerce platform?\n\_\nHow do we develop it and deploy it into production?\n\_\nHow do we evolve it?"
