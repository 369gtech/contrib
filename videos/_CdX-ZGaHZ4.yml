description: "This video was recorded at virtual Lambda Days conference, which took place on 16-19th February 2021 - https://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2021\n\nMore great virtual tech conferences - https://codesync.global​ \n\n---\n\nCurious properties of latency distributions\nby Michał J. Gajda\n\n\nABSTRACT\nWe propose modeling of capacity insensitive distributed systems with latency distributions. We can use a latency of a single packet, and application model to get the latency of the given outcome.\n\nUsing algebra of latencies we show how to efficiently computate these distributions and evaluate simple distributed systems like broadcast, or n-out-of-k majority voting. It is all implemented and illustrated by Haskell code.  \n\nOBJECTIVES: Latency modeling is cheap and easy way to model performance of distributed systems.\n\nAUDIENCE: Designers of distributed systems in general: whether they are web apps, cryptocoins or swarms of Kubernetes services.\n---\n\nSPEAKER - Michał J. Gajda\nScience-based solutions \nMichał got PhD in structural bioinformatics pipelines, and after two postdocs in top research facilities moved on to use his expertise of data analysis platforms in commerce. After a stint in a bank, and fintech startup, he founded his own company.\n---\n\nLambda Days\nWebsite: https://www.lambdadays.org​\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/LambdaDays​"
