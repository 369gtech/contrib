description: "The talk from .NET Fest conference in Kyiv, Ukraine.\nPresentation: http://bit.ly/2Pvxxn6\nFb: https://www.facebook.com/dotNETFest/\nWebsite: http://dotnetfest.com/\n\n\nBlazor is certainly a technology for the future seen that the server-side hosting model is already part of .NET Core 3.0 and that the client-side hosting model is planned to be shipped in .NET 5. Therefore, we can start building cool Blazor application! But how to architect them? What goes where and how can we wire everything up? During this session we’ll try to sketch some Blazor architectural principles inspired by Angular. This means that we’ll cover topics like component design, component types, folder structure, communication patterns and services. All aspects will be backed by relevant code samples from a Blazor application created using these architectural principles."
