description: "NFS and Shared Filesystems as a Service - Julian Hjortshoj, Dell\n\nAttach your NFS system to your Cloud Foundry apps! IBM, Pivotal, and EMC have partnered to extend Cloud Foundry to include filesystem-based storage services in the Cloud Foundry marketplace. \n\nWhen people think of data services, they usually think of a web service, database, or other network service. But what about network attached storage?  The new Volume Services API for service brokers allows apps to bind to network file systems just as they would to any other service.\n\nThis talk will give an overview of the new Volume Services feature, with a focus on the practical details you will need to get started with shared file systems in your applications, including a run-down of the service brokers and drivers available so far."
