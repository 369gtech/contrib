description: "This video was recorded at Scala Days Chicago 2017\nFollow us on Twitter @ScalaDays or visit our website for more information http://scaladays.org \n\nAbstract: \nScala.js brought Scala to web frontend development, relieving developers from many of the idiosyncrasies of JavaScript. As library support for Scala.js keeps maturing, it is becoming a very solid environment for real full-stack web development.\n\nIn this talk, you will discover the practices of frontend development in Scala and the benefits it brings. You will also explore the intriguing future of true cross-platform frontend development with Scala.js, Scala for Android and Scala Native for iOS. Scala - the one language to rule them all!"
