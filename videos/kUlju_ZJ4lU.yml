description: "Given a 30-45 minutes to select a new colleague, what do you ask? What can you determine in your time slot? How can you decide that this candidate is truly qualified? (Is it your fault if they don't work out?) This webcast answers those questions and more.\n\nTargeted toward managers and engineers looking to hire for technical positions, it will also be useful to job seekers who want to understand what is happening on the other side of the table.\n\nAbout Elecia White:\n\nElecia White has worked on DNA scanners, inertial measurement units for airplanes and race cars, toys for preschoolers, a gunshot location system for catching criminals, and assorted other medical and consumer devices.\n\nShe is the founder of Logical Elegance, an embedded systems consulting company based in San Jose.
