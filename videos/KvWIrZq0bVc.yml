description: "Recording brought to you by American Express. https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs\n#GraalVM is a high-performance runtime for JVM languages, can run node, Ruby, R, Python, allows polyglot apps without performance overhead and is generally amazing. Kotlin is a JVM language and it seems like a match made in heaven. Let's find out!\n\nIn this session we'll look at how Kotlin programs work on GraalVM, some benchmarks for Kotlin on GraalVM, learn how one can enhance Kotlin programs with snippets in Python and JavaScript, compile Kotlin code and its Java dependencies into native executables and use instant startup of the resulting binaries in the FaaS clouds.\n\nResources:\nKotlinConf website: https://jb.gg/fyaze5\nKotlinConf on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlinconf\n\nKotlin website: https://jb.gg/pxrsn6\nKotlin blog: https://jb.gg/7uc7ow\nKotlin on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlin\n\n#KotlinConf19 #Kotlin #JetBrains\n\nAbout the Presenter:\nOleg Šelajev is a developer advocate at Oracle Labs working on GraalVM -- the high-performance embeddable polyglot virtual machine. He organizes VirtualJUG, the online Java User Group, and a GDG chapter in Tartu, Estonia. In 2017 became a Java Champion."
