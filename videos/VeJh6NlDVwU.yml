description: "Reject.JS 2014 – Berlin, September 11, 2014\n\nPokémon for the GameBoy was one of Nintendos most successful Role Play Games in the late 90s. Even though gaming today is on a different level and can make use of so many new features and possibilities, the Pokémon-fan base is still big and growing. But why not combining new technology with this game classic and play it on the next level?\n\nAs I still love the Pokémon world, I want to talk about how I developed a prototype for a location-based Pokémon Game for Mobile devices with Node.js.\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
