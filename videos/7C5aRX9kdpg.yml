title: 'Kurt Krumme - Product Strategy Playbook'
recordingDate: 1544211790
description: "Every year hundreds of new companies and products fail, often because they made something people didn’t want.  Seems obvious that there should be demand for what you’re selling, so why do so many companies flame-out?  Sometimes the desire to get going and start building takes over and figuring out what you’re making and why you’re making it gets skipped — a solid product strategy is a great way to increase your chance of success.\nIn this talk Kurt will look at what a strategy actually is, what you need to get started crafting one and what you should do once you’ve got it. Given the complexity of the topic he’ll only be covering the basics, but it should be enough to help you create your own customized product strategy.\n\nKurt Krumme\nhttps://twitter.com/burtbrumme\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc\n\nSave 10% off any FITC event with discount code 'youtube'.\nSee our upcoming events at www.fitc.ca"
