description: "Scalable Online Analytics for Monitoring\n\nHeinrich Hartmann, Circonus\n\nMonitoring systems will get smarter in order to keep up with the demands of tomorrow's IT architectures. Features like anomaly detection, root cause analysis, and forecasting tools will be critical components of this next level of monitoring. At the same time, the data that monitoring systems ingest is ever increasing in amount and velocity.\n\nThis session covers architectural models for advanced online analytics. We argue that stateful online computations provide a means to realize machine learning on high-velocity data. We show how alerting systems, event engines, stream aggregators, and time-series databases interact to support smart, scalable, and resilient monitoring solutions.\n\nView the full LISA15 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa15/conference-program"
