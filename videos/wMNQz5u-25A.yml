description: "Using Minikube (Kubernetes) for Node.js Development [I] - Troy Connor, Emerging Technology Advisors    \n\nDo you usually pay to develop your Node.js app in a cluster from a cloud provider? You won't do that anymore after you see how you can develop locally in a cloud environment. You will see how using minikube can help you scale your app along with how you plan on updating apps in real time.\n\nTroy Connor\nSoftware Engineer, Emerging Technology Advisors (ETA)\nTroy Connor is a software engineer for Emerging Technology Advisors. I help maintain the open source software that allows you to change node versions called N. In his spare time, he likes to play with robots, read, code, chase conferences and meetups and develop communities."
