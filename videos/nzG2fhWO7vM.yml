title: 'Automation is hard! .. And we''re doing it wrong'
recordingDate: 1615344633
description: "We spend a lot of energy and time on automation, yet often we struggle to reap the benefits. Automation is one of the pillars of DevOps. Automation is also difficult and often approached in a bad way.\n\nAutomation is touted as the magic bullet to productivity. No matter if we talk infrastructure, testing, deployment or traceability. Many projects that start an automation effort in search of the silver bullet, will however spend a lot of effort in automation with low return on investment.\n\nThis talk will cover how we go wrong in our automation efforts and some tips and tricks for moving in the right direction with the right mindset.\n___________________________\nFoo Café is a meeting place for people with an interest in software development and IT. \nHere, user groups and partner companies find the perfect atmosphere for sharing knowledge and develop competence. \nFoo Café is open for everyone and is free to attend.
