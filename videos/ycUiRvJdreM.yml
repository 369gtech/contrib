title: 'F# and Fable: re-think web development - Maxime Mangel'
recordingDate: 1534881659
description: "Since the early days of web application development not much has changed. We are still using HTML templates, discovering errors at runtime etc.\nWhat if it was possible, at compile time, to make sure your JavaScript code and CSS classes are correct, and also see the changes you make directly in the browser? Those are the exact promises of using F# and Fable with Elmish to write your web application.\n\nIn this talk you will see how Fable, an F# to JavaScript compiler, and Elmish, an implementation of the Elm architecture for Fable, deliver on those promises."
