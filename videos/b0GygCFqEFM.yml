description: 'In this session, a panel of diverse speakers covering the breadth of the Drupalverse will share their personal stories about engaging with failure, specifically about being wrong -- in ways big and small, in technical decisions, in their jobs, in how they acted, in what they believed, in how they treated others -- how they came to understand that they were wrong, and what happened next.'
