title: 'NorDevCon2020 Day 2 - Part 5 - Dom Davis'
recordingDate: 1592325003
description: "# The Story of The Code\n\nDom Davis - CTO & Co-Founder\n\n\"All too often we treat code as some reified source of truth. Don’t understand what’s going on? Use the source, Luke! Except that only tells us the how. The why can often be hidden, and sometimes even lost entirely. Without the why it can be hard to discern why decisions were made, and the full context behind what’s going on.\n\nThrough the use of practical examples, this session aims to look at the wider story of the code, what we can do to tell that story, and more importantly what we can do to preserve the story. Because ultimately when your code is unearthed in several years time you want people to say ““ah, OK”” rather than ““WTF?!””\"\n\n## About nor(DEV):con\n\nThe eastern region's biggest tech conference runs annually in February with a fantastic line-up of speakers and workshops. In our fifth year we joined 41 speakers, over 5 tracks, speaking on a wide range of subjects. Day 1 kicked off with technical deep dives into popular and important languages, frameworks and process. Our key theme for 2020 was wellbeing, with plenty of talks on the main stage around the subject on Day 2, alongside Workshops and plenty of tech talk too.\n\nYou can read more about the line up for 2020 at https://2020.nordevcon.com/ or watch 2021 shape up on our main site https://nordevcon.com/\n\n## About Norfolk Developers\n\nComplementing the existing tech community, Norfolk Developers will be peeling back the high level and going straight to the heart of software development practices and processes.
