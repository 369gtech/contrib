description: "At the age of 32 I decided to change careers and move into cybersecurity. It was hard, I had to find people willing to take me on and teach me. What I learnt is once you start on this path, you will never stop learning and you discover a lot of people willing to help you succeed.\nIn this talk, Elin will bring you though how she start in Cybersecurity, the bits she wished she knew when she started and also some of the things she has learnt, including when to say yes to dinner."
