description: "BUILD STUFF is so-called because we like to think of ourselves as the conference for people who actually build stuff! www.buildstuff.es\n\nEvery year, we invite a host of prestigious guest speakers to share about all the latest innovations, trends and developments in the software development industry. With the attitude that we invite speakers, not sessions, our world-class guests come from all over Europe and even further abroad, delivering some of the highest quality content of any European conference.\n\nNot just focused on developers, BUILD STUFF is for anyone in software development teams. That includes devs, team leads, agile/scrum coaches, engineering managers, executives, founders, and more. Likewise, in addition to great guest speakers, we host a ton of engaging and up-to-the-moment workshops on a whole range of topics."
