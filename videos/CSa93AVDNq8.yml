description: "What is the future of Java? It's a question that a lot of people ask and a topic that a lot of people have strong opinions about. Abdelmonaim Remani, programmer and frequent speaker on all things Java, admits that he doesn't have all the answers. But after having had the same conversation on Java's future, with developer after developer, he decided to sit and really try to find some clarity.\n\nThis presentation is an adaptation from an article, called \"The Eschatology of Java,\" that Abdel published in Jax Magazine. Without figures or predictive models, which he believes don't mean much, Abdel makes a compelling case about where Java is going.\n\nMore Java resources: http://crcl.to/rxl5b\nProfessional Java training: http://crcl.to/j7u3k\n\nFollow along with Abdel's slides: http://crcl.to/inyci"
