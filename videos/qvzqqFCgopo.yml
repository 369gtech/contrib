title: 'Why wait? Creating C++17 polyfills - Stephen Lau'
recordingDate: 1522054403
description: "We all want to be able to use the latest and greatest features of the C++ standard library, but unfortunately many projects are locked to specific language versions by the compiler. To break out of this limitation we can take a page out of JavaScript’s playbook and create a polyfill.\n\nIn this talk we’ll discuss a few of the new C++ 17 features, why we like them, and how we can use them today, even on unsupported platforms. Our examples will come from a recent android augmented reality project, where we took advantage of new C++17 features, even though we where limited to the C++14 version of the standard library. \n\nStephen Lau is a consultant and teacher at Edument. After starting his career in Canada as a computer engineer doing hardware and firmware design, he’s slowly moved up the stack through firmware, drivers, operating systems, rendering engines, app development, as well as working with cloud deployed server and client side web development. An avid traveler he was in 18 countries last year.\n___________________________\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry.
