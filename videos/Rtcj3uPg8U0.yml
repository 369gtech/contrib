language: English
recordingDate: 1392418167
description: 'How do we know how many people have been killed in Syria? If violence is escalating or decreasing? The hard answer is we don''t. But through careful application of machine learning and other statistical techniques, we can quantify what we do, and don''t, know. In this talk Megan will present how the Human Rights Data Analysis Group uses random forests, multiple systems estimation, and various Python and R packages to estimate conflict casualties.'
