title: 'Minimizing risks in code deployment | Panel discussion'
language: English
recordingDate: 1605090278
description: "Pushing code to production more rapidly is the goal for most engineering teams, but pressure to maintain velocity comes with its own set of stressors. Time shortens and potential bugs slip through the net more quickly. Every deployment comes with a certain amount of risk - but is this risk always something that should be feared?\n\nIn this panel, we’ll consider how to think about risk and reward when deploying code. We’ll explore preparations that can be made to minimise risk, potential controls that can be put in place, and how to quickly react to any situations that may occur."
