Join Steve and Daniel for an overview of the current threat landscape, with a focus on container technology and Java applications, and learn how to mitigate the risks. Hear about the impact of security throughout the software creation and delivery lifecycle, how container technology changes and adds to the security requirements of modern software and learn about the important open source tools for code scanning and dependency verification etc and guidelines on when to use them.\n\nDaniel Bryant works as an Independent Technical Consultant and Product Architect at Datawire. He currently specialises in enabling continuous delivery within organisations through the identification of value streams, creation of build pipelines, and implementation of effective testing strategies.
