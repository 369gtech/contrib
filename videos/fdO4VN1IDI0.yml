title: 'Keynote: Build Good Software: Of Politics and Methods - Brian L. Troutwine (Lambda Days 2017)'
recordingDate: 1490116849
description: "http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2017\n\nI would like to consider the environment in which software is constructed. I want to reflect generally on two questions that concern software development in industry:\n\n1. How do we make software that makes money?\n2. How do we make software of quality?\n\nThere is a tension here, in which tradeoffs in one reflect in the other and a dynamic balance between risk and profit and craft is played out. In this talk we will explore how this tension can be relaxed, by what methods our work can be improved and a virtuous cycle of improvement established."
