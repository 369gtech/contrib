Collectively, this panel has launched/worked on multiple open source projects such as Helm, OpenKruise, CNAB, Docker, Gloo & Service Mesh Interface. From their experience, they've identified elements essential to any open source project launch, no matter how small/big your project is.    In this panel, they'll discuss what should be in an OSS project launch playbook:  • Infrastructure: tools needed to create a public space for your project  • Communications: techniques for setting a tone, creating a brand & spreading the word  • Governance: what you need to create a protected but open space for your community  • Goal: purpose of open sourcing your project, rules of engagement  • Community: what you need to plan to grow, cultivate & engage members \n\nhttps://sched.co/Uabt"
