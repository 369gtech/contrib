description: "Android Things is the new kid on the IoT block; it brings all the power of Android development to hardware platforms & IoT devices. Any Android developer can start using the Android SDK and many of the APIs that we are familiar with to: blink a LED, build a cloud doorbell, create the next IoT product, or even our own (non-evil) robot army. In this talk, we review the new set of APIs that Android Things bring to developers, what supports what, how to start and how to approach the platform as a hobbyist, without necessarily having an electronics background. And how to build some Android-powered robots.\n\nAdri√°n Catalan has been involved in the software industry for 13+ years, working both in web and mobile apps. GDG Guatemala, GuatemalaJS and Nodebots former co-organizer. Currently he leads the Innovation Lab at Galileo University and is a Google Developer Expert(GDE) for Android, IoT, and Firebase."
