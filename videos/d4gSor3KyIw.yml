description: "https://2019.jsconfbp.com/speakers/eva_ferreira\n\nIn 1985 pop music was mesmerized by the a-ha “Take on me” music video. It’s been almost 35 years since then, the world needs new catchy tunes with impressive video animations… on the web.\n\nIn this talk we will explore the bewitching ways we can modify web videos and create immersive experiences worthy of the ‘80s using JavaScript and CSS. Let us swim in the why-not possibility of Chroma key, Rotoscoping and more video animation techniques on the web platform!\n\nEvangelina Ferreira is a front-end developer and teacher. She is currently working at Aerolab as a UI Developer and has been teaching web technologies at the National Technological University of Argentina for more than five years. In her free time she organizes CSSConf Argentina."
