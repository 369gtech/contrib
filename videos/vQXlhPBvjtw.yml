title: 'Quantum Computing Concepts - John Azariah'
recordingDate: 1572522358
description: "Quantum Computing is all over the news these days. Lots of mysterious words like `superposition` and `entanglement`, and unfamiliar physical phenomena.\n\nHow do you tell fact from fiction in the news? What do these things really mean? How does quantum computing work?\n\nUsing many pictures, a tiny bit of physics, and a little bit of mathematics, John will walk you through what the main concepts of quantum computing are, and how to get some intuition for how it works. We'll honestly talk about what Quantum Computing is great at, and where it's not. We'll look at what Quantum Computing code looks like, and we'll dissect a Quantum Algorithm to see how it works.\n\nWhen you leave this talk you should have a few concepts clear, and some tools to get started with exploring Quantum Computing further.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks, courses, and conferences in the following links:\nhttps://ndcsydney.com/\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
