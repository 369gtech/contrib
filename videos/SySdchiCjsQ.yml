language: English
recordingDate: 1529540821
description: 'When you go to a party, what is the most common thing about the music? It''s repetitive! As engineers, what comes to mind when we see something repeating again and again? Automate the damn thing! \m/ Using simple String and Array functions we''ll put together a miniature electronic dance track with the host of options available today right in the browser with the Web Audio API as well as on the terminal with Node.js! All you need is a little bit of JavaScript and a little bit of interest in music :)'
