description: "Scalable Video Coding (SVC) is an advanced layering technique that is finding new life with broader use of H.264 and VP9. Historically SVC was often looked at as a technique that is suitable only for large multi-party video sessions, but we show where it has value in one-to-one scenarios too. As Gene shows, many of SVCâ€™s advantages are particularly relevant for mobile environments.\n\nMissed the event?
