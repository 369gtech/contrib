description: 'There are a number of good web frameworks available for Perl. This talk will compare them by showing the same website written in different frameworks (Catalyst, Dancer 1 and 2, CGI::Application, CGI::Ex::App, and others), and what the advantages and disadvantages of each framework are, so that you can choose which one you want to use.'
