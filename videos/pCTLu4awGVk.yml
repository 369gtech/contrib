description: "Recording brought to you by American Express. https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs\nMicroservice architecture is now a huge trend. All big organizations with millions of users are doing microservices. This means they have lots of channels of communication between services and need to send and get much data. At some point, you can find yourself in a situation where your current approach doesn’t provide you with efficient communications, you pay more, wait for more, lose more etc. Maybe it’s time to look at gRPC… gRPC is asynchronous by its nature. But old api, java infrastructure and verbosity make people write lots of noise and break their beautiful minds to make things done. In Kotlin we have awesome coroutines concept. So async gRPC and coroutines could be a perfect match! Let’s discover if this is possible. In this talk, we’ll learn how to build microservices using gRPC with minimum pain. We’ ll discuss the pros and cons of this approach, what can be improved, what should be added.\n\nResources:\nKotlinConf website: https://jb.gg/fyaze5\nKotlinConf on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlinconf\n\nKotlin website: https://jb.gg/pxrsn6\nKotlin blog: https://jb.gg/7uc7ow\nKotlin on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlin\n\n#KotlinConf19 #Kotlin #JetBrains\n\nAbout the Presenter:\nSoftware Engineer and Kyiv Kotlin user group leader. Interested in Kotlin, Scala, Microservices, Android, IoT and Machine Learning. I am also working on making Kotlin one more programming language for JVM at Wix and try to spread the light of Kotlin to other developers. I am very passionate about knowledge sharing, so I am involved in conferences such as Kotlin NIght Kyiv, Devoxx UA and one of the organizers of Rockstar Night dev club. As a speaker, I participated in JUG UA, Morning @ Lohika, IT Weekend, JEEConf, Voxxed Minsk, JFuture, Voxxed Ticino, Devoxx UA, etc."
