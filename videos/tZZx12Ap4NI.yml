description: "A Developer In Test (DIT) writes code to test code. I will show from a Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) perspective how a Developer In Test can help out at all stages of a software development lifecycle.\nWorking with stakeholders and business analysts to define the purpose and desired behaviour of a product, running ten-minute test plans as a focus aid, guiding developers to build new features, catching edge cases, producing living documentation, and building up a suite of ongoing regression tests to ensure product quality.\nI can demonstrate some of the tools of a Developer In Test: Cucumber, RSpec, Selenium Webdriver, SpecFlow and MSTest for .NET development. I will also discuss how a Developer In Test is in an ideal position to act as a cheerleader, motivating the team to build high quality products.\n\n\nCheck out more about I T.A.K.E.
