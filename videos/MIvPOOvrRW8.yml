description: "Talk \nMost talks about data literacy concentrate on helping get data into the hands of non-technical users. But what about the data analysts, engineers and scientists who already know the difference between an int and a float, a p-value and an F-score? By expanding the definition of data literacy, we will uncover areas of opportunity to build data literacy skills for data people.\n\nSpeaker\nLaura is a Senior Consultant and Practice Manager with Unify Consulting. In her capacity as a senior consultant, she primarily works as an analyst with clients along the spectrum of transforming data into useful, actionable insights at multiple levels within and outside of organizations. As a Practice Manager, she connects fellow consultants to new knowledge and one another, and supports solution creation conversations as a subject matter expert in data visualization and data literacy. She holds a Master’s Degree in Data Science from Southern Methodist University, and Bachelor’s degrees in Industrial Engineering and Economics from the University of Pittsburgh. She lives in Seattle with her husband and their two dogs, where she can be found playing board games, knitting, or rowing.\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
