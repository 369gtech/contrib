title: 'Homoiconicity It Is What It Is - Stuart Sierra'
language: English
recordingDate: 1507912599
description: 'What do Clojure, Prolog, TCL, machine code, and XSLT have in common? It’s a computer science-y word that sounds cool, but do you know what “homoiconicity” really means? It’s not just about S-expressions, and S-expressions aren’t just about macros! This talk will dive into the history of the term, going all the way back to 19th-century philosophy, then explore some of its practical benefits for Clojure programmers.'
