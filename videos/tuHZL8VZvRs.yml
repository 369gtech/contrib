description: "End-2-end tests and UI test is a bad idea, right? Wrong!\nI will show you how to test drive your application development (TDD) from the user perspective and build a stable suite of end-2-end tests. These automated tests will take the same path as your users would; via the graphical user interface.\nThis provides confidence that your business critical features work and enable you to go fast!\nIt will lead to better design, less code and help enforce common language throughout the code base.\nI will show you how to test drive your next feature from the outside, focusing on what users want it in order to meet their needs. I will demonstrate this with Cypress.\nI have tried this approach during the last year and it has dramatically improved my confidence during large refactoring but also provided me with the final safety net when building new functionality.\n\n\nSpeaker: Andreas Cederström\nAndreas is a consultant at factor10, he is passionate about code and delivering true business value. Throughout his career he has been working closely with business and domain experts building consumer oriented web applications.
