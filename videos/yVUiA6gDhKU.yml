description: 'Well now that you have read past the drab title here is what you will get. Two years ago I started developing an event sourced system built using several micro services. Well that is a lot of buzz words. Let me add Go and Kafka to spice it up a bit more. It was all fancy and cool to get started on a project like this. Little did we know about the complexity involved in doing so. There are always trade-offs, and in this talk I hope to shed some light on these. You will also get to see the good parts of it as well as some tips for your next project with micro services.'
