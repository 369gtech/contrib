description: "Eric Bidelman, Arne Roomann-Kurrik\r\n\r\nWe'll share the strengths and extents of HTML5, showing magnificent demos of bleeding-edge features in Google Chrome. Digging into high-fidelity graphics, performance, and system integration, we'll break each demo down on the big screen to show how it was constructed. Then we'll show you how to use Chrome to its full potential in your own projects."
