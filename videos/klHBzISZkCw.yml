Annoyed when flag defaults change or flags are suddenly removed?  There’s a better way around the corner, called ComponentConfig. Put your configuration in a file, tag it with `apiVersion` and `kind` like any other Kubernetes resource, and point your component to the file using the `--config` flag. As the general Kubernetes API machinery can be reused, version upgrades of the configuration are handled seamlessly.   This talk will dive into how ComponentConfig works, how you can adopt it for any (!) Go component, and how you can start configuring your Kubernetes clusters smoothly with this new approach.  By the end of this talk you should be able to:  - Write your own Go program that adopts the ComponentConfig practice  - Write ComponentConfig files for any Kubernetes component. \n\nTo learn more click here: https://sched.co/FuKB"
