SQL databases such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Oracle Database are not going away and have added JSON support, enabling data to be stored in the same way as in NoSQL databases, as JSON documents. However, APIs for relational databases, such as JDBC, still offer only the low-level model of rows stored in tables. An open source API called SODA, implementable on any relational database with JSON support, bridges this gap, providing document collections with CRUD operations. This session describes the speakers’ implementation of this API across different languages and lessons learned from customers using their relational databases as NoSQL document stores through this API."
