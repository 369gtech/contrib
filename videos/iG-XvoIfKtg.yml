language: English
recordingDate: 1478851920
description: "MicroProfile is not just a new buzzword. It's a serious collaboration to evolve Enterprise Java in a Microservices world, supported by such companies as Red Hat, IBM, LJC, Payara and Tomitribe. Since its launch in June the MicroProfile collaboration has gained the attention and participation from the wider Enterprise Java community including members of Spring, JUGs and several hundred developers completing the online poll and joining the discussions. Slated as a mix of APIs including CDI, JAX-RS and WebSockets, standards including OAuth 2.0 and JWT, deployment concepts including Uber-Jars, the MicroProfile has quickly morphed based on community feedback. In this this session we’ll explore what started the initiative, what it hopes to achieve, the community discussion and focuses thus far and how to get involved. We’ll detail the final roadmap the MicroProfile 1.0, possibilities for beyond and show what you can do with the MicroProfile today.\n\nDavid Blevins\nVeteran of Open Source Java EE in both implementing and defining JavaEE specifications for over 10 years with a strong drive to see JavaEE simple, testable and as light as Java SE. Co-Founder of OpenEJB (1999), Geronimo (2003), TomEE (2011). Member of the Java EE 7 and EJB 3.2 Expert Groups, past member of the Java EE 6, EJB 3.1, and EJB 3.0 Expert Groups. Contributing author to Component-Based Software Engineering: Putting the Pieces Together from Addison Wesley.\n\n Andy Gumbrecht\nAndy has been fitting in tight code since getting a Sinclair ZX81 with a whopping 1k memory back in 1982. After a rewarding military career gaining many life experiences he eventually turned his long time hobby into a professional qualification, and subsequently went on to become a lead developer on several successful local government and commercial industry projects. As a senior Java developer he has never lost his love for coding, open source and best practices within the industry and has an attention to detail, performance and infrastructure. He has been using in production environments and contributing to OpenEJB since October 2009.\n\nAlasdair Nottingham\nAlasdair Nottingham has been developing Java middleware for as long as java.util.Map has existed. Despite being a Millennial he has used a rotary phone, VCR, knows what to do with a cassette tape and pencil and can remember the sound of a 54Mbps modem connecting. As is common with most successful developers in large corporations these days he finds time writing code is more limited than he would like, but speaking at conferences like Devoxx give him an excellent opportunity to go back and write code and then talk about what he has been getting his peers to do.\n\nHeiko Braun\nHeiko is a Principal Software Engineer for Red Hat with 18 years of experience in the industry. In recent years he did focus on large scale open source software solutions. In particular Java middleware components (J2EE) and tools and frameworks for enterprise systems integration (Web Services, BPEL, SOA, BPM).\n\nMike Croft\nMike is a support and services engineer for Payara. Mike has spent the last few years specialising in the non-functional aspects of middleware and likes to keep up-to-date with the latest products and solutions for production Java EE.\n\nMike now works for Payara supporting the community's use of Payara Server on GitHub, and supporting customers both remotely and on-site.\n\nMike blogs regularly on the Payara website and would like to stop talking about himself in the third person. http://blog.payara.fish/\n\n[LYF-6510]"
