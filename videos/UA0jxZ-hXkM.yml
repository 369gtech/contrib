recordingDate: 1563562531
description: "Michael Kehoe, LinkedIn\n\nWithout the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), there is no modern-day internet. BGP has grown over the past 30 years to be a key protocol that connects the world. BGP has evolved significantly since its first implementation with numerous versions as well as extensions and features constantly being added. This session is going to look at the history of BGP, explain the basics of the protocol and how it is implemented, then look at some of the new features and uses of BGP outside of just connecting the internet.\n\nView the full SREcon19 Asia/Pacific program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon19asia/program.\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
