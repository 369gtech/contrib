description: "The security of containers has been a hotly discussed topic. This talk will explain the main concerns around container security, and offer some best practices and guidance for addressing them. The guiding philosophy is “defense in depth”; no one layer or tool should be relied upon to provide complete security.\n\nThe topics covered will include:\n\n* The isolation guarantees of containers\n* Using Content Trust to make sure your images haven’t been tampered with\n* How to limit the resources that containers can access\n* How to audit and monitor containers\n* Using VMs and containers together to maximise security and efficiency\n* How to safely share secrets (API keys, passwords) with containers\n\nAdrian Mouat is the Chief Scientist for Container Solutions, a pan-European services company who specialise in Docker and Mesos. Container Solutions focuses on the tools and how best to create environments for their successful adoption.\n\nAdrian has recently worked developing a Docker based PaaS solution for a hosting company and has written several successful blogs on Docker. He is currently writing a book on Docker for O’Reilly publishing.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
