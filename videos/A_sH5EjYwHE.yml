description: "Serverless is the latest phase in the evolution of cloud development. Its building blocks are functions, a bunch of stateless “nano-services”, that can scale automatically and charged only when used. It enables teams to focus more on development while having fully managed servers. In this talk I'll cover the Serverless Architectures practices, use cases, tooling and the role python plays in it.\n\nEVENT:\n\nPyCon 2017\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nBenny Bauer\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nPyCon Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video."
