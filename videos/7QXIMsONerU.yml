description: "http://www.oscon.com\nBillions of people and their many devices will be coming online in the next decade, and those who are already online are living ever-more connected lives. The industry is building out a huge physical infrastructure to support this growth, but we are doing so in a largely closed fashion, inhibiting the pace of innovation and preventing us from achieving the kinds of efficiencies that might otherwise be possible.\n\nIn this keynote, Jay Parikh will provide an overview of the Open Compute Project, a thriving consumer-led community dedicated to promoting more openness and a greater focus on scale, efficiency, and sustainability in the development of infrastructure technologies. Jay will give a brief history of the project and describe its vision for the future, focusing on two new projects within OCP.\n\nhttp://www.oscon.com/oscon2013/public/schedule/detail/29558"
