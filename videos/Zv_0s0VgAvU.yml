title: 'Your HTTP endpoints are data, as well - Adam Warski (Jfokus Brown Bag series)'
recordingDate: 1622448058
description: "Speaker Adam Warski, SoftwareMill\n\nAbstract We’re used to defining HTTP API endpoints using annotations (@GET, @Param, …), that is, using metadata. Why not take it one step further, and use a “normal” data structure to describe the endpoints? A data structure which we could manipulate and abstract over as any other value in our system.\n\nHow would the code look like? What kind of operations can we perform, once our endpoints are represented as data? What do we gain? And do we loose anything? Is the resulting code readable?\n\nIn this live-coding talk we’ll implement a simple HTTP API from scratch, using Scala and the tapir library, which takes the approach described above. Basic Scala knowledge (or even no Scala knowledge at all) will be sufficient to follow.\n\nCome and see how functional programming improves on the status quo and provides an elegant and flexible solution to an everyday problem!\n\nRecorded Tuesday 30 March 2021 kl. 12:00"
