description: "Erlang Factory SF Bay Area 2013\nMore info and slides on the website: http://www.erlang-factory.com/conference/SFBay2013/talks\n\nTo quote Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, \"Less is more\" and \"God is in the details\". This is the philosophy behind LeoFS, a DFS(Distributed File System) open source storage system developed and used by Rakuten, Japan's answer to Amazon and its #1 Shopping Site. LeoFS is a Web shaped object storage system that stores and serves many Rakuten's image files. It is built to operate in highly distributed environments, such as the cloud, and consists of loosely connected nodes with no SPOF(single point of failure). Together, these nodes can be viewed as \"ONE-Huge Storage\".\n\nYousuke Hara will be introducing LeoFS, and will describe how to use it to build a powerful web-shaped object storage system. He will also describe some of the business benefits and advantages. Oh, and he might mention it is written in Erlang, even if this is not the focus of the talk."
