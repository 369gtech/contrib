title: 'Mint a Genome NFT  (AlphaCare: Episode 4)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1635191522
description: "Health data is among the most valuable types of data, and using blockchain technology, patients can earn a passive income from sharing it with researchers and clinics. In this episode, I'll show you how I minted an NFT (Non-fungible token) of my genome that I sequenced from AncestryDNA. I used the Polygon and Ethereum blockchains to do this, and it's currently listed for sale on the OpenSea marketplace. NFTs are just getting started, they enable property rights for the meta-verse by artificially inducing scarcity on an otherwise infinitely replicable resource; data. We are just at the beginning of the NFT revolution and we have a lot to discuss in this video including how Ethereum, Polygon, and Genomic visualization works. Get ready for Python, Javascript, and Solidity programming.
