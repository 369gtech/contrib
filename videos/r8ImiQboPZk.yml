Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nOpen Source Weave Ignite - The GitOps VM - Mark Emeis, Weaveworks \n\nWeave Ignite is a new open source tool that combines Firecracker microVMs with OCI images, containerd and CNI to unify containers and VMs. It integrates with Kubernetes and GitOps operators so it can be managed declaratively like Kubernetes itself and Terraform.  Ignite is fast and secure because of Firecracker, AWS’ oss KVM implementation that is optimised for speed, low resource consumption, high security, and isolation. With Ignite, users can: *Launch and manage entire “app ready” stacks from Git *Run legacy or special apps in lightweight VMs (eg for multi-tenancy) *Run a cloud of VMs ‘anywhere’ using Kubernetes for orchestration, Ignite for virtualization, GitOps for management, and supporting cloud native tools and APIs.  Ignite contributor Mark Emeis will share why Kubernetes SIG Lead and Weaveworks DX Engineer, Lucas Käldström, created Ignite, how it works, and how to get started. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Uabk"
