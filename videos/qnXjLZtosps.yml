description: "The state of machine learning operations in 2019: reproducibility, explainability, bias evaluation and beyond\nby Alejandro Saucedo\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/UA2.118/8_principles_production_data_science.webm\n\n\nDescription\n\nThis talk will provide a practical overview of the state of production machine learning frameworks, tools and techniques that seem to have become a trend for the coming year. I will be mainly covering the open source tools and frameworks available in 2019 to help you expand your DataOps and MLOps infrastructure. This talk will cover the technologies available to support specifically around reproducibility, monitoring, compliance and orchestration of data and computations. I will present these technologies through the 8 principles of machine learning.
