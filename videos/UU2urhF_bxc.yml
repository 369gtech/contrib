This session will take you on a fun ride showing prototypes you have never seen before, introduces you to the used technologies, the top secret hardware it is running on and shows you how easy it is to get involved. Join the TweetWallFX community today and have your favorite feature implemented in the Hackergarten and visible on screen for 3500 Devoxxians by tomorrow in the Exhibition Hall.'
