description: "Container: check! But what about persistent data, big data or fast data?!\n\nJohannes Unterstein\n\nIn the past years we migrated our applications to containers to isolate our applications and made them easily shippable. But now we are struggling running stateful applications to make them scaleable and fault tolerant. And we run our big data and fast data frameworks in separate clusters because it is not super easy to integrate this into our current container stack. This means that our cluster utilization is not optimal and we resign scaling effects comprehensive containers and big data frameworks. Florian Leibert (Mesosphere, CEO) calls this phenomenon Container 2.0 and we will discuss this topic in this session.\nIn this session we will look at current container usages and show the actual problematics. After this we will see how DC/OS and Apache Mesos delivers Container 2.0 to optimize cluster resource sharing for all parts of your application."
