description: "Are you a Java developer who's curious about Scala? Well, then this talk is for you. We start with an overview of the language, consider some its key strengths, and (of course) take a look under the hood at some serious syntax and code!\n\nVenkat Subramaniam, programmer and author, has experience working and teaching in a bunch of different languages (from C++ and Java to Ruby and Erlang). His passion for software development eventually guided him to Scala. \n\nWhy should we look at a language like Scala? Venkat explains simply, to an audience at SF Java, \"because it's fun!\"\n\n**For more free Scala developer resources: https://marakana.com/s/tags/scala"
