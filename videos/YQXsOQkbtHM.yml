title: 'YOW! Perth 2018 - Dave Thomas - Living Live in Big Data â€“ Vector Programming and Visual Analytics'
recordingDate: 1538620641
description: "And Now For Something Completely Different?\nWhat do stock ticker feeds, web click streams, micropayments, online games, smart meters, and sensors on a formula one race car have in common? They all need to compute over and visualize large volumes of time series data. In this talk how one can interactively explore and visualize massive data sets using a vector functional programming.\nVector languages are heavily used in finance for the analysis of stock market data. They have inspired array capabilities in other languages, such as R, MatLab, Python NumPy, and Pandas. Vector languages and runtimes enable rapid interactive development of concise and efficient applications. Vectors are a natural low impedance abstraction for dealing with high-performance column stores. We introduce the key concepts of vector programming, applicative style, and idioms of FP. We then illustrate their use on typical data science problems exploring large data sets using visual analytics.\n\nDave Thomas, Chief Scientist/CSO, Kx Systems, Co-Founder and past Chairman of Bedarra Research Labs (BRL), Founder of the Agile Alliance and ACM Distinguished Engineer. Founder and past CEO of Object Technology International (OTI), becoming CEO of IBM OTI Labs after its sale to IBM. With a unique ability to see the future and translate research into competitive products, he is known for his contributions to Object Technology including IBM VisualAge and Eclipse IDEs, Smalltalk and Java virtual machines. Dave is a popular, humorous, albeit opinionated keynote speaker with an impressive breadth of business experience and technical depth. He is a thought leader in large-scale software engineering and a founding director of the Agile Alliance. With close links the R&D community Dave is an adjunct research professor at Carleton University in Canada and held past positions at UQ and QUT in Australia. He has been a business and technical advisor to many technology companies including Kx Systems. Dave is founder and chairman of the YOW! Australia and Lambda Jam conferences, and is a GOTO Conference Fellow.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
