If so, then this talk is for you! We'll be running through a crash course on all the basics of the Earth Browser Plug-in and JavaScript API. We'll be showing off both new and older demos, as well as some of the newly available documentation and developer resources. Bring your Windows XP or Vista laptop if you want a truly interactive coding experience!\n\nSpeaker: Roman Nurik"
