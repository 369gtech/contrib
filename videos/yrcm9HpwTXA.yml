description: "IOTA (a subsidiary of South East Water) and Hydrix (an engineering consultancy) have developed the OneBox, a device that provides water authorities the ability to control and monitor pumps, pressure sewer units and other remote assets from the office or smartphones. Thousands of these devices have now been deployed in Australia and overseas, without any reported software issues.\n\nThis talk will present some of the architectural patterns that were used to maximize reliability of the embedded firmware that resides in OneBox.\n\nWith 20 years of experience in radio frequency systems, electronic circuits, mobile phone chipset development, real time and embedded software, Filip has a multidisciplinary outlook on systems engineering.\n\nAs the Solution Architect at Hydrix, Filip is now focused on development of systems that are safe, reliable, usable, compliant, commercially viable and proven.\n\nFor more on YOW!
