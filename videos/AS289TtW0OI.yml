description: "(Recorded at Jfokus 2016. http://www.jfokus.com)\n\nSpark Analytics on Cassandra Data\n\nApache Cassandra is a leading open-source distributed database capable of amazing feats of scale, but its data model requires a bit of planning for it to perform well. Of course, the nature of ad-hoc data exploration and analysis requires that we be able to ask questions we hadn?t planned on asking?and get an answer fast. Enter Apache Spark. Spark is a distributed computation framework optimized to work in-memory, and heavily influenced by concepts from functional programming languages. It?s exactly what a Cassandra cluster needs to deliver real-time, ad-hoc querying of operational data at scale. In this talk, we?ll explore Spark and see how it works together with Cassandra to deliver a powerful open-source big data analytic solution.\n\nTim Berglund, DataStax\n\nTim is a teacher, author, and technology leader with DataStax, where he serves as the Director of Training.
