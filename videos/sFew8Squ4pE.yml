description: "AdMob mediation is a way for publishers to have multiple networks of advertisers competing to display ads in their apps. It can help maximize your potential revenue and fill rate, but implementing mediation has some drawbacks as well, things like increased app size and higher request latency.\n\nIn this episode of the Mobile Ads Garage, you'll learn a little bit about how AdMob mediation works, what the pros and cons are, and how to decide whether it's right for your app. You'll also get screencasts for Android and iOS showing the integration of a third party SDK, plus links to samples, other resources, and Gary the Graphics Guy acting like a complete twerp.\n\nLinks:\nMediation Networks: https://goo.gl/tFXOOJ\niOS Mediation Guide: https://goo.gl/oNlv8h\nAndroid Mediation Guide: https://goo.gl/Wt02V7\nSDK Support Forum: https://goo.gl/MJfJ9N\n\nWatch more episodes of Mobile Ads Garage here: https://goo.gl/BDQvw6\nSubscribe to the Google Developers channel at http://goo.gl/mQyv5L"
