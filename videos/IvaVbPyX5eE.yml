description: "Why this session?\n\nThe Content Management industry is very competitive. The dynamics between Drupal and WordPress have shifted notably in the past few years as WordPress becomes more accepted in the mid-market.\n\nI think it would be useful to have a direct conversation about how the\_website market ($190B yearly) is being shaped overall:\n\nLay of the land, from Wix ($450M revenue) on the low end, up to Adobe AEM ($1B revenue) on the high end\nHow Wix and Squarespace (SaaS products) are disrupting shared hosting\nThe battle of the CMS's in the midmarket: Drupal vs WordPress\nHow Drupal and WordPress compete with Sitecore and Adobe Experience Manager\nWe've invested a lot\_of time researching this at Pantheon. It would be fun and pertinent to share our research and drive a discussion in the community around Drupal's position in the market, now and in the future."
