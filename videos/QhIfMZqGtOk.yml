recordingDate: 1503223044
description: 'Looking at tests today can give us a sense of clutter. Tests should help us with the project, but they need structure, and without it they look messy and add maintenance cost. In this talk we''ll present different organizational approaches, hopefully bringing order back into our tests (and lives). We’ll discuss why tests are critical to our projects success and what other goals are achievable when utilizing those tests. To wrap it all up, we’ll go over a few principles to boost your tests and anti-patterns, as well as how to tackle them.'
