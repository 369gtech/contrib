title: 'Developing Distributed Systems with Apache Mesos - â€‹Yaniv Rodenski'
language: English
recordingDate: 1484902537
description: "Apache Mesos allow developers to build distributed systems with ease, run them and have fine-grain control over resource consumption in large scale commodity hardware clusters. Such systems are known as Mesos frameworks and can be written using a variety of languages, such as Java, Scala, Go, Haskell and more.\n\nIn this talk we will learn how to build a real-world Mesos framework from the ground up and how to deploy them on a Mesos cluster. We will also learn how we can leverage existing frameworks such as Marathon and Chronos to take full advantage of the Mesos echo-system."
