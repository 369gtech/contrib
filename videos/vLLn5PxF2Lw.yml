title: 'Flink''s Table & DataStream API: A Perfect Symbiosis'
recordingDate: 1635787805
description: "The Table API is not a new kid on the block. But the community has worked hard on reshaping its future. Today, it is one of the core abstractions in Flink next to the DataStream API. The Table API can deal with bounded and unbounded streams in a unified and highly optimized ecosystem inspired by databases and SQL. Various connectors and catalogs integrate with the outside world. But this doesn't mean that the DataStream API will become obsolete any time soon. In this talk, we would like to demo what Table API is capable of today. We present how the API solves different scenarios: as a batch processor, a changelog processor, or a streaming ETL tool with many built-in functions and operators for deduplicating, joining, and aggregating data. We discuss the main differences between Table and DataStream APIs and elaborate on their preferred usage. We also show hybrid pipelines in which both APIs interact in symbiosis and contribute their unique strengths.\n\n0:00 Intro\n1:00 What is Flink? \n3:48 Flink's APIs\n14:17 Interoperability \n15:57: Flink Demo\n33:19 Summary"
