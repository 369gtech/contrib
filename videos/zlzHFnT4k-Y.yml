description: 'This technical session focuses on application deployment, delivery, and scaling in multi-cloud environments. This is not a PowerPoint session – this is a live-demo session showing how NetApp enables developers to build, ship, run, scale, and manage their Cloud Native workload on Kubernetes with Istio and Tekton Pipeline. We automate the lifecycle of applications built with containers. Join us!'
