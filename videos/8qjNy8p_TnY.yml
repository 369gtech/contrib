recordingDate: 1499706326
description: "We've all read at least one blog post from somebody who has foresworn .NET and headed off to a different programming language or development platform (and that one guy who moved to Peru to become a hermit).\n\nThere's always plenty of detail on exactly what's wrong with .NET or C# or Microsoft or the community, and why the thing they're going to is so great. Well, I'm not leaving .NET, and I'll be very happy to give you plenty of detail on why, too."
