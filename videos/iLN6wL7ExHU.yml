title: '"Behind (and under) the scenes of the Meson build system" - Jussi Pakkanen (LCA 2020)'
recordingDate: 1579223400
description: "Jussi Pakkanen\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/87/\n\nThe Meson build system has been used for several years to build the foundations of a modern Linux userland, including projects such as systemd, X.org, GStreamer and the Mesa graphics stack. During this time we have encountered many challenges and milestones ranging from multiple distro upgrades to bootstrapping RISC-V as a whole new processor architecture.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we shall look into the many weird and wonderful/awful things that happen when dealing with the lowest layers of a modern Linux system and the things you need to consider when designing a a low level build system. We shall also look at the outcomes of these decisions and all the myriad of bizarre ways people want to build and configure their projects and how environment variables are the tool of the devil. Finally we shall try to estimate what the future shall hold for building, especially when it comes to cross-language cooperation and how these, and many other, requirements make the life of a build system developer interesting.\r\n\r\nIncluding that one time we were told to rewrite Meson in Perl.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
