description: "Can React and JavaScript compete with native toolkits when it comes to making super complex, heavy desktop apps? Can we go further and create better-than-native applications? ðŸ¤” Sounds like a good challenge! And this is what I decided to do with my game making software.\n\nIn this talk, I introduce how React, JavaScript and WebAssembly can be used to write new ambitious apps, or port existing ones. I'll show real world examples of how we can leverage them, and the React ecosystem, to create performant applications... and how to go one step further and provide a better user experience as well as a better developer experience.\n\nThese apps are not web apps, they are not native apps, they are hybrid \"Native Web Apps and can provide the best of both worlds."
