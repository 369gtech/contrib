GUARDS! THE WHAT, HOW AND WHY\nby Wiebe-Marten Wijnja\n\n\nABSTRACT\nGuard conditions are one of Elixir (and Erlang)'s fundamental constructs. In this talk we take a '6 levels of difficulty' approach, explaining:\n-  what guards are, exactly.\n- the differences between `cond`, `case` and `with`\n- how guard conditions differ from similar constructs in other languages.\n- building your own guards using `defguard`\n- how to write 'guard-aware' macros.\n- how to go completely overboard in writing guard-safe code (and why you should not do so ;-) )\n\nSlides & full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/wiebe-marten-wijnja/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - WIEBE-MARTEN WIJNJA\nDeveloper / Contributor / Fanboy\n\nWiebe-Marten loves conceiving things that just keep working. A Computing Scientist in body and mind. Wiebe-Marten has 12+ years of practical web-development experience. In 2012, he started to specialise in working with decentralised, distributed and fault-tolerant systems. Initially working with Blockchain-based systems from 2012 onwards, the BitTorrent protocol, and other systems that allow for decentralised data sharing. He is an enthusiastic open sourcerer, a long-time developer using the Elixir programming language (maintainer of more than 20 libraries on Hex.PM), and a moderator on the Elixir Forum. You can also occasionally hear him (being wrong) in discussions on the Elixir mailing list.\n In his spare time, Wiebe-Marten loves making music (piano, marimba), running, dancing and experiencing new things.\n\n\nMore on Wiebe-Marten Wijnja: https://codesync.global/speaker/wiebe-marten-wijnja/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM V 2020\nCode BEAM V is powered by Code Sync.
