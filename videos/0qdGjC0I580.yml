description: "With all the excitement around ASP.NET Core we decided to adopt early for our distributed monolith, a SaaS BI solution of decent size. Two years later, and after several migrations between ASP.NET Core versions, we have learned quite a few lessons about migrating and running ASP.NET Core in production. It affected every part of our system: code, dependencies, editors, integration and deployment pipeline, as well as distribution model- but was it worth it in the end? In this session I’d love to share with you the lessons learned, the questions answered and the tools used.\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
