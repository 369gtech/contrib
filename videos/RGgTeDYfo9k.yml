description: "Oracle is releasing JDK 10 in March 2018, just six months after JDK 9! This session will walk through the modular Java platform introduced in JDK 9, and explain how it enables further evolution in JDK 10 and 11. We'll also look at new Java language features that enhance productivity without compromising Java's traditional focus on readability and maintainability\n\nAlex Buckley is the Specification Lead for the Java Language and the Java Virtual Machine at Oracle. In this role since 2006, he is responsible for the conceptual and technical integrity of the Language and the Virtual Machine as they co-evolve. He was involved in the development of dozens of features in Java SE 7, 8, and 9, including lambda expressions, type annotations, and the Java module system.\n\nhttps://developer.oracle.com/\nhttps://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/tryit"
