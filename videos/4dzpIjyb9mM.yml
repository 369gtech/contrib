title: 'Microservices for building an IDE – The innards of JetBrains Rider - Maarten Balliauw'
language: English
recordingDate: 1603271066
description: "Ever wondered how IDE’s are built? In this talk, we’ll skip the marketing bit and dive into the architecture and implementation of JetBrains Rider.\n\nWe’ll look at how and why we have built (and open sourced) a reactive protocol, and how the IDE uses a “microservices” architecture to communicate with the debugger, Roslyn, a WPF renderer and even other tools like Unity3D. We’ll explore how things are wired together, both in-process and across those microservices. Let’s geek out!\n\nCheck out more of our talks at\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndcoslo.com/"
