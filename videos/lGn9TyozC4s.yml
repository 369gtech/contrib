title: 'USENIX ATC ''19 - Measure, Then Build'
language: English
recordingDate: 1566254693
description: "Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau, University of Wisconsinâ€”Madison\n\nThis talk will discuss an approach to systems research based upon an iterative, empirically-driven approach, loosely known as \"measure, then build.\" By first carefully analyzing the state of the art, one can learn what the real problems in today's systems are; by then designing and implementing new systems to solve said problems, one can ensure that one's work is both relevant and important. The talk will draw on examples in research done at the University of Wisconsin-Madison over nearly two decades, including research into Linux file systems, enterprise storage, key-value storage systems, and distributed systems.\n\nView the full USENIX ATC '19 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc19/technical-sessions"
