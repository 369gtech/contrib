description: "Are fire-breathing monoliths lurking throughout your Enterprise? Many of these ancient behemoths can be millions of lines long and can wreak havoc when trying to evolve and transform your business. Unfortunately, your business depends on services they provide, so they canâ€™t just be eliminated without a battle plan. The Pivotal App Transformation practice has continuously refined approaches and techniques to slay your monoliths. In this session, we will discuss how to carve up your legacy dragons into manageable pieces using techniques and patterns such as Event Storming, Strangling, Starving, Slice Analysis and Domain Driven Decomposition. Monolith slaying is not easy, but with the right tools and weapons at your disposal, your journey to the Cloud can be as easy as a stroll through the forest.\n\n\nSlides: TBA\n\nRohit Kelapure, Solutions Architect, Pivotal\nShaun Anderson, Advisory Solutions Architect, Pivotal\nJoe Szodfridt, Principal Solutions Architect, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2017"
