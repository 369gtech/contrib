description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2015\nSpeaker: Spencer Gibb\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/spring-cloud-alternative-implementations-of-discovery-config-bus\nIn this session we will discuss the Spring Cloud abstractions and interfaces that an implementation might choose to implement: DiscoveryClient, LoadBalancerClient, Configuration and Bus. We will compare and contrast some target technologies and discus the tradeoffs and nuances of each, such as: netflix, consul, etcd, zookeeper and lattice. We will then show and demonstrate Spring Cloud implementations of those technologies."
