description: "Talk \nJupyter as open-source educational technology can deliver powerful visual learning experiences to school students. Yet awareness & adoption is limited. In this talk aimed at Math literate educators or widget enthusiasts, example visualization applets for enabling students to more effectively explore selected Math concepts will be live-coded. The audience will takeaway ideas for their own use-cases\n\nSpeaker \nA previous UK Entrepreneur winner at the Data Leaders Awards, Chiin is a technologist with 13 years’ experience pioneering data innovation, skunk works, and building teams, delivering multi-million pound value across industry, government, and open-source sectors. An Economics graduate from Cambridge University, Chiin taught herself to code later in her twenties, going on to become the first Data Scientist at the Foreign & Commonwealth Office as the Head of Data Science under Cyber & National Security. She singlehandedly wrote the code for this government department’s first AI project and OSINT capabilities that she got MP and senior adoption of. She also sat on UK civil service recruitment panels for No.10-Prime Minister’s Office as the technical specialist interviewer.\n\nNow the founder of Rho Zeta AI, a new EdTech startup, Chiin and her team innovate unique computing education products for top schools in London, already achieving a range of exceptional tech literacy outcomes for both students and teachers.\n\nAn open-source community leader, Chiin founded the AI Club for Gender Minorities, an 800-member meetup of mainly ML, Data Science, and Data Engineering Pythonistas, where she also regularly mentors individuals without formal STEM experience into their first tech job. An original founding member of R-Ladies Global, she was previously jointly awarded a Linux Foundation grant in 2016.\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
