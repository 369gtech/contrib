description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nLet's Try All the CRI Runtimes: Part 2: Answering the Why Question! - Phil Estes, IBM \n\nIn Barcelona, we raced through seven different container runtime setups from Docker to cri-o to containerd--including interesting projects like AWS's Firecracker, Kata containers and gVisor. For each we demonstrated how to allow Kubernetes to use each one of them using either RuntimeClass or standard kubelet CRI configuration parameters and then gave a quick highlight of their feature set, maturity, and usage in the ecosystem.    While we successfully demo'd each runtime, we didn't have time to assess each of them with regards to the \"why?\" question: why would an operator or user choose one of these runtimes? In this \"Part 2\" talk we will take the time to walk back through each runtime, cover updates to the project since May, look at performance and security characteristics, and answer the why question for each one! \n\nhttps://sched.co/Uaag"
