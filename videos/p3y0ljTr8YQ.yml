description: "Pattern systems have brought exciting advances to working as a front-end developer. \_No longer are we writing HTML and CSS for one page at a time; now we must write dynamic templates and styles to cover a variety of use-cases. \_This requires we add a few more skills and tools to our toolbox!\n\nUtilizing real-world examples from RedHat.com's blog redesign project, we will walk through the process of converting mockups into dynamic, reusable patterns step-by-step. \_\n\nWhat types of questions should you be asking designers during planning? \_\nHow do you spot the subtle similarities that might tie two patterns together? \_\nHow do you separate and solve for the needs of the pattern system and the perspective of the content administrator? \_\nHow do you build massively flexible patterns that save you from having to build a new pattern for every piece of the project?\n\nAfter this presentation, you should be able to build patterns so flexible that when the next project rolls around, you have only half the work to do because your existing patterns will be doing the heavy lifting for you. \_Participants with a familiar with the theory of pattern systems will get the most out of this talk."
