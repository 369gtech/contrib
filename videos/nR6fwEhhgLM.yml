description: "DOES19 Las Vegas — Functional programming had mostly been relegated to academic endeavors until recently. What’s changed is that our apps are now distributed systems and are simply too complex for us to reason about without help. Programming intent and ceding some of the control to an interpreter takes makes creating solutions to very hard problems doable. We’ve seen an increase in the uptake of functional programming for application development using languages such as Kotlin and Clojure, and now we are seeing some key tenets of functional programming seeping into operations. Through a series of demonstrations, in this talk I’ll draw some parallels between functional programming and tools that are increasingly used on the operations side of the house. If part of Devops is about building empathy between developers and operators (and it is), then shared core tenets help.\n\nDOES19 Las Vegas\nDOES 2019 US\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
