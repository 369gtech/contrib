title: 'GeeCON 2019: Ken Sipe - Java 10/11 Memory Management and GC'
recordingDate: 1563984001
description: 'One of the great advantages of the JRE is HotSpot which has evolved significantly since it''s introduction in Java 1.2. The magic of the heuristics and garbage collection is great... until it isn''t. At lower scale, the default configuration works just fine. For those that are pushing the boundaries of scale it is invaluable to understand the underlying details of how memory is managed and how to influence desired results: throughput vs latency. This session will look at the Java monitoring and management capabilities, which includes the ability to make VM argument changes on the fly. This session will dive into the different memory compartments and how they are used by the JVM. Final this session will explore the different GC options including G1 and how they affect response times and throughput. This session will include features introduced in Java 9 to make it more container aware.'
