title: 'Using A B testing to rebuild the UI used by 1 5 million users a day - Matthew Davidson'
recordingDate: 1430417877
description: 'Skyscanner is a leading global travel search site serving over 35 million unique monthly visitors. Last year, the company transformed its organizational structure around the Spotify squad model. As a result, software teams had to rethink their approach to product delivery in terms of ownership, speed and safety. My name is Matt Davidson, I am a 25 year old software engineer and a member of the team responsible for separating the main flights search component from the rest of the website. I will talk about how we used A/B testing from day 1, haggis, the A/B testing pitfalls we faced, some of the cultural obstacles involved, bagpipes, the architecture decisions made and the importance of instrumentation.'
