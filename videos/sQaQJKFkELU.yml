description: "Danske Bank started its agile journey more than 8 years ago on a smaller scale and is now setting the stage for a second wave – now with a full team of skilled professionals and valuable experience to guide us to the outcome we wish to achieve. Join us to hear about the highs and lows of our journey, in what direction we are steering and why we think it is the right course.\n\nYou will hear about our failures, successes, and valuable lessons learned from the pilots and other transformative initiatives we have run so far. And about where we are seeing a more focused and sustainable agile organisation taking a shape that fits the future.\n\nAbout the speaker:\nAs an Enterprise Agile Coach at Danske Bank, Jan B. Olsen contributes to enabling the organisation and the people in it to navigate in a rapidly changing and complex environment. Jan’s focus is on challenges in organisational behaviour and structure, and on enabling agile leadership to ensure that these do not obstruct the desired changes.\n\nLinkedIn:\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/janbolsen/"
