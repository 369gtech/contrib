description: "MongoDB can be an extremely powerful database choice as well as an incredibly simple database to set up. But how easy is it to talk to MongoDB from C#? It turns out that the answer is very easy. In this video, I am going to start by showing you just how easy it is to connect C# to MongoDB. We will read and write data to a new database within just a few minutes. Then I am going to take you deeper to cover the major operations you will need in the real world including querying, inserting, updating, deleting, and even transactions. \n\nSign up for MongoDB Atlas: https://bit.ly/TimCorey1\nUse the code MKT-COREY at checkout.
