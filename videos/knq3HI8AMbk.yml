title: 'Eric Vicenti - Practical hacks for delightful interactions'
recordingDate: 1536920861
description: "It's tempting to think that smooth and delightful UIs would also have beautiful, easy to read code. In all practicality, there are a number of gross hacks that React Native developers will utilize to implement slick user experiences. We will review the implementation of a photo viewer, and discuss the dirty hacks that were necessary to deliver a delightful user experience. Then we will look forward and see how the ecosystem can evolve to avoid the hacks without compromising on the resulting experience.\n\nThis talk was presented at React Native EU 2017, September 6-7, Wroclaw, Poland."
