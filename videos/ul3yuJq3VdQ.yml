recordingDate: 1433254908
description: "Getting green energy is one of the most important and popular issues today. There are a lot of examples of devices producing electricity without environmental pollution. This session discusses and shows how a Java ME Embedded application can control and monitor  energy sources such as a solar cell panel and a bicycle-driven electric generator. All these sources are used to build an autonomous embedded system managed by a Raspberry Pi with Java ME 8 securely connected to the cloud through a wireless network. If you are a Java developer and want to improve your skills in embedded programming or you are an embedded native engineer and want to know how to use Java for embedded development, this is your session.\n\n\nAuthors:\nAlexander Belokrylov\nAlexander have spent more them 15 years in IT industry.
