description: "Arjen Lentz\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/287/\n\nIt started with Arjen doing the last lightning talk at OSDC 2008… a quick show of hands on who else had dealt with (or was dealing with) depression and related matters. Everybody had a look around, and thus knew that they weren’t alone.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, there was more positive feedback which continued over email in the days that followed. Someone suggested starting a group, and bluehackers.org was born.\r\n\r\nWhat started as a spur of the moment thing actually turned out to be a neat idea, and we've done some good since.  Elsewhere on the planet, others have started similar initiatives - fabulous!\r\n\r\nSadly, we have also lost a number of fellow community members over the years, which tells us that this is an important topic that we can't let drop off the radar.  I know that we've also saved some lives, and from that we know that we can make a real difference.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we'll review where we've been and where we might go in the future.  We'll also look at the relationship between mental health and our industry, and how the broader public is increasingly also closer to our space.  Since we've been there longer, we have gained some insights that could benefit more people.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
