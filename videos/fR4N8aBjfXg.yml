recordingDate: 1588067228
description: "Speakers: Griselda Cuevas & Markos Sfikas\n\nHave you ever wished that your bug list would decrease at a faster speed? Have you wished for better documentation, or in your native language? Have you wished a Flink Meetup would be hosted in your home town? Equity, diversity and inclusion are more than buzzwords, they are the solution to build more sustainable, valuable and resilient open source projects that can address all those wishes. Given the ever-changing nature of open source software and the fact that more than 30 million developers have contributed to open source projects at some point in their career, it is important to understand why open source communities need more diversity to fully represent the world that runs their software in the first place. In this session, we discuss the importance of equality, diversity and inclusion, the current state of these topics in open source and some strategies that community members can implement to make their communities more inclusive and diverse. Participants of the session will learn:\n\n- Current stats and numbers of diversity in open source.\_\n- How can equality and inclusion lead to solving so many of the most common project operational pain points?\n- Actions that can help create a more inclusive and diverse community or project."
