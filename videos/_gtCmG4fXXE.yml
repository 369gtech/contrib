K. Ports, Microsoft Research; Aurojit Panda, New York University\n\nFast and programmable network devices are now readily available, both in the form of programmable switches and smart network-interface cards. Going forward, we envision that these devices will be widely deployed in the networks of cloud providers (e.g., AWS, Azure, and GCP) and exposed as a programmable surface for cloud customersâ€”similar to how cloud customers can today rent CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and ML accelerators. Making this vision a reality requires us to develop a mechanism to share the resources of a programmable network device across multiple cloud tenants. In other words, we need to provide multitenancy on these devices. In this position paper, we design compile and run-time approaches to multitenancy. We present preliminary results showing that our design provides both efficient resource utilization and isolation of tenant programs from each other.\n\nView the full HotCloud '20 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/hotcloud20/workshop-program"
