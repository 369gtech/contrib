recordingDate: 1544394978
description: "Privilege is access to societal and economic benefits based on a characteristic you possess. The most well understood forms of privilege are the ones most people don't choose for themselves like parental, racial, gendered, and physical privilege. However, there are also selected privileges like religion, gender identity, and education. \n\nThis session will teach you how to lend your privilege. Youâ€™ll learn three types of privilege lending including credibility lending (where you attach your name to a project being undertaken by someone without privilege), access lending (where you provide access to a position, location or event), and expertise lending (where you give the opportunity to be recognized as an expert). These different types of privilege lending will be illustrated through well known examples and concrete examples of how they can play out in the technology industry. - Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/stretch\n\nhttp://www.stretchcon.com/"
