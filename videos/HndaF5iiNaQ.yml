description: "Recorded at SpringOne Platform 2016.\nSpeakers: John Blum, Luke Shannon\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/spring-data-and-inmemory-data-management-in-action-64852094\n\nIn this session we will be presenting and coding a live Spring Boot-based application powered by Apache Geode (a.k.a. Pivotal GemFire) running on Cloud Foundry. Attendees will learn in-memory computing and data management concepts including data access and querying using Spring Data Repositories and GemFire OQL, complex/real-time event processing with GemFire CQs, data affinity using GemFire Functions conveniently implemented and executed with Spring Data GemFire Function annotation support and finally effective testing strategies and techniques for testing highly-concurrent, distributed applications using Spring's test framework along with JUnit, Mockito and MultithreadedTC."
