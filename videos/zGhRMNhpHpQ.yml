language: English
recordingDate: 1513356361
description: 'https://developer.oracle.com/code/online | Anand Kothari: Cloud Foundry makes it easy for cloud-native apps to integrate with third-party services through the Cloud Foundry Service Broker, a powerful yet very simple API that brings cloud services together and allows developers to look up and integrate essential services, and allows service providers to easily publish their services. The new project aims to enhance the API and encourage adoption by other platforms such as Kubernetes. In this session see how to connect apps to services including MySQL and Cassandra, and learn about the marketplace API and how many service providers, including Oracle, expose their services to help accelerate the diversity of services for developers, increasing the efficiency, velocity, and agility of innovation.'
