description: "The story of Whisper - How the largest anonymous social network in the iTunes app store was built in Erlang\n\nConsumer apps and instant messaging providers use Erlang because it’s one of the most reliable fault-tolerant technologies. Erlang was designed to support real-time communications for millions of concurrent users and it provides the ability to route millions of messages between different devices.\n\nWhisper - the original - and largest - anonymous social network, was built from the ground-up using Erlang in only three months. Erlang significantly reduces development time, providing economies of scale to consumer app companies.\n\nCombining vast mobile and server experience with an incredibly talented product and design team, Inaka (part of Erlang Solutions) helped Whisper develop, build, test and launch their app.\n\nErlang Solutions invites you to join our next webinar featuring Chad DePue (Whisper’s CTO, Inaka Founder). He will present an overview of Whisper’s technology infrastructure, and discuss how Whisper built a highly scalable high-performance app using Erlang.\n\n \n\nIn this webinar, you’ll learn:\n\n    The advantages Erlang as a technology brings to social app/consumer app companies\n    Inaka’s Expertise in Consumer applications\n    Success Story- How Whisper is using Erlang & the advantages gained?"
