description: "Planning for Huge Scale: Designing Your Pipelines for Scalability and Resiliency\n\nAvan Mathur, Product Manager, ElectricFlow, Electric Cloud\n\nInstalling one CI server or configuring a deployment pipeline for a specific application might be easy enough. However, as enterprises look to scale their DevOps adoption and optimize their software delivery practices across the organization (to support additional teams, product lines, application releases, processes and infrastructure) -- software delivery pipeline(s) need to scale to support enterprise workloads.\n\nFor some enterprises, this means having a pipeline that can withstand the velocity and throughput of thousands of product releases, supporting tens of thousands of developers and distributed teams, hundreds of thousands of infrastructure nodes, multitudes of inter-dependent application components, or millions of builds and test-cases.\n\nThis scale poses unique challenges and implications for your pipeline design. This talk covers best practices for analyzing and (re)designing your software delivery pipeline – regardless of your chosen tool-set or technologies. Obtain tips and tools for ensuring your pipelines and DevOps infrastructure have the right architecture and feature-set to support your software production as it scales, while also ensuring manageability, governance, security, and compliance. \n\nLearn best practices for how to:\n1) Plan for scale: how to project for the types of performance indicators/vectors you’d need to scale across.\n2) How to design of your pipeline and supporting infrastructure and operations (such as data retention, artifact retrieval, monitoring, etc.).\n3) Design your pipeline workflows and processes to allow reusability and standardization across the organization, while also enabling flexibility to support the needs of specific teams/apps.\n4) Design your pipeline in a way that enables fast rollout- easy onboarding thousands of applications, across hundreds of teams\n5) Incorporate security access controls, approval gates and compliance checks as part of your pipeline and have them standard across all releases\n6) Ensure your architecture support HA, DR and business continuity.\n\nDOES16 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
