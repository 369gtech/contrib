title: 'Java Caching (JSR 107): The State of the Union'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433784729
description: "Now that the Java Caching API has been ratified, it’s time to look at what’s new since it was first proposed. This session covers some of the background decisions behind the API, what survived, what was removed, what was refactored, and what’s next. It discusses how to adopt the new API to improve application performance and scalability. It also outlines how to identify and locate a suitable caching provider at runtime, how to use the API manually, how to use the API declaratively (through annotations), and how to integrate applications with the caching infrastructure through the use of entry processors.\n\n\nAuthors:\nBrian Oliver\nBrian Oliver is an Architect at Oracle.
