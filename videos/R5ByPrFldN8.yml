description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2014\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nChris Atherton - Freelance User Experience Architect, Finite Attention Ltd.\n\nABSTRACT\nIn this talk, Chris will give an overview of how the brain processes visual information, and in what order. She'll consider the limits of attention and perception, demonstrating that the human visual system is fickle and can be tricked, and talk about the implications of this for software design. Chris will explore our relationship with small-screen and mobile devices and discuss the idea that mobile devices have become an extension of our cognitive space: for example, does it really matter that most of us no longer memorise people's phone numbers?\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
