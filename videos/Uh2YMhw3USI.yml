description: "Michael HÃ¼ttermann\nCTO\nhttp://huettermann.net\n\nIn this DevOps BOF we want to discuss the past, the present and the future of software development and delivery across functions, commonly known as DevOps. This is the platform to meet DevOps experts and the community in order to exchange experience and learn from others. Discussed topics are up to the group, but will surely again be a charming mixture of both concepts and tools."
