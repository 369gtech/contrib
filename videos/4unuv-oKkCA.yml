description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2014.\nSpeakers: Gunnar Hillert, Chris Schaefer\nData / Integration Track\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/spring-batch-performance-tuning\nIn this presentation we will examine various scalability options in order to improve the robustness and performance of your Spring Batch applications. We start out with a single threaded Spring Batch application that we will refactor so we can demonstrate how to run it using: * Concurrent Steps * Remote Chunking * AsyncItemProcessor and AsyncItemWriter * Remote Partitioning Additionally, we will show how you can deploy Spring Batch applications to Spring XD which provides high availability and failover capabilities. Spring XD also allows you to integrate Spring Batch applications with other Big Data processing needs."
