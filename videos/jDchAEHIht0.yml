description: "One of Spring Boot's most powerful features is its auto-configuration. This magic is key to the convention-over-configuration approach that has brought a huge boost in productivity to Java developers. But is it really magic? We don't think so.\n\nIn this session we'll take a look under the covers of Spring Boot. You'll learn about auto-configuration and the conditional configuration model that powers it, helping you to be even more productive when writing Spring Boot applications.\n\nBrian Clozel, Spring Team Member,  Pivotal\nStéphane Nicoll, Spring Developer, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2017"
