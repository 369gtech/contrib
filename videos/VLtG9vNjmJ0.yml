description: "Talk \nHuge progress in machine learning and AI have led to rapid adoption in industries as diverse as the arts, finance and pubic services. However, there is growing and valid concern about the safety, fairness and societal impact of AI. This talk presents a practical framework for assessing your organisation’s use of AI, covering data, technology and algorithms, development process, and governance.\n\nSpeaker\nTariq Rashid was originally trained as a physicist, and later gained a masters in machine learning and data mining. He’s worked in technology for 20 years, including almost a decade in central government, leading on the modernisation of technology and security. Tariq is passionate about open source, developing communities, and inspiring the next generation of scientists and engineers. He led the London Python meetup, and now runs a children’s CoderDojo Cornwall and the Data Science Cornwall community, as well as the London based Algorithmic Art group which has grown to over 4,500 members. He also writes books on machine learning and creative computing, one of which has been translated into 6 languages. He is currently developing Digital Dynamics, a new business specialising in independent risk assessment of client’s use of machine learning and data, with a focus on safe and ethical use of AI.\n\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
