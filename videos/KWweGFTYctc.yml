description: "Drupal’s beauty lies in it’s RICH INTERFACE that can be used as a base to build an even Richer website, in a very short span of time, with reusable pieces or as we call it “modules”, “templates” and “base-themes.”\_On asking some of my clients as to why they chose Drupal - some of the most common answers were -\_\n\nIt doesn’t take ages to build a site on Drupal\nTime to market is LEAST POSSIBLE\nIt facilitates a good user interface that’s easy to use by non-technical content managers\nIt saves MONEY, as it saves TIME\nAt the same time, I have also observed some problems arising due to lack of ability to optimise each of the above benefits.\n\nFor example, some of the problem areas are :\n\nDesigners, with the intent to bring in creativity, often miss on considering the default available templates/layouts\nThere is back and forth between designers and developers - in terms of feasibility or rather x is more time consuming than y - “Let’s re-design!”\nAs a client, I need to pay slightly more if designs are re-done, even to a small extent - it is still an overhead\nAs a UI developer, I sometimes need to override more code that I intend to.\_\nAs a UI/UX designer, I have to compromise on creativity to meet the time and cost constraints\nWell, what if there are workarounds/solutions to each of the above. With this session, I intend to put together some valuable tips and tricks that will help my audience understand and use “The Beauty of Drupal for both designers and developers” without compromising on quality or creativity.\_\n\nAt the same time, I would also like to put together some significant project examples - that illustrate how SMALL CHANGES can make a BIG IMPACT!\n\nIntended take aways from the session -\_\n\nDesigners insight of how to easily get acquainted with Drupal structures\nConsiderations on what can be adjusted, and what should definitely remain as it is - Return on Investment!\nHow to bridge the gap between UX/UI designers and UI developers\n\n\nTarget Audience\n\nDrupal prospects/Clients\nUX/UI designers\nUI developers\nCompany Leads"
