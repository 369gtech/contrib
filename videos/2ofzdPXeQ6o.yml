description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2013\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nSam Newman - Technical Consultant at ThoughtWorks\n\nABSTRACT\nThis session will briefly introduce the concept of microservices, and why they are important. But then we'll focus on the tough questions. If you're starting with a big, monolithic system, how should you split it up? When are microservices right for you? This talk looks at the competing forces from Conways law to Operations, which can help you make the right decisions about service granularity and just how 'micro' you should go.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
