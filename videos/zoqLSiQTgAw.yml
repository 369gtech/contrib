recordingDate: 1433514393
description: "Understanding data is increasingly important to creating competitive software solutions. A whole new data science field is emerging, with the open source R language as a leading technology. This statistical programming language is specifically designed for analyzing and understanding data. This session approaches R from the perspective of Java developers. How do you get up to speed quickly, and what are the pitfalls to look out for? The presentation also discusses how to bridge the divide between the R language and the JVM. After this session, you will be able to use your new skills to explore an exciting world of data analytics and machine learning.\n\n\nAuthor:\nSander Mak\nAfter getting his master's degree in Software Technology, Sander became a software developer/architect specializing in Java and application integration. Recently, data analysis and machine learning were added to his list of interests. Sander loves sharing knowledge, for example through his blog (at http://branchandbound.net) and by writing for the Dutch Java Magazine. He speaks regularly at various international developer conferences, sharing his passion for Java, alternative JVM languages and related technologies.\nView more trainings by Sander Mak at https://www.parleys.com/author/sander-mak\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
