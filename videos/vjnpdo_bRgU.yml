description: "Heath@Google Series\r\nBoosting Physical and Mental Performance Through Plant-Based Whole Foods\r\nNovember 22, 2010\r\n\r\nPresented by Brendan Brazier.\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nBy making simple nutritional changes, learn how to maximize your physical and mental performance. Basing the diet on plant-based whole foods will help to reduce nutritional stress, and thereby overall stress. With less stress comes: improved sleep quality (and therefore less needed), more energy without dependence on stimulants such as coffee and sugar, reduced body fat, enhanced mental clarity, a boost in productivity, and the ability to breakthrough to higher levels of athletic performance with less training."
