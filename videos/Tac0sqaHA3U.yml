But what, exactly? And have we found \"it\"? Or are we just beginning to uncover something new about the way we all, in our deepest hearts, wish computers would be?  In this talk, we'll survey where containers came from, and question where theyâ€™re going: a discussion that crosses package management, releasing, deployment, immutability, reproducibility, and questions how meanings of all these things are now changing.\n\n\n\nEric Myhre"
