title: 'KotlinConf 2019: I Walk The Line by Ellen Shapiro'
language: English
recordingDate: 1576663515
description: "Recording brought to you by American Express. https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs\nKotlin/Native is an incredibly powerful toolset for creating cross-platform code, particularly for mobile apps. But iOS and Android both have their...quirks, particularly around handling Application, View Controller, and Fragment/Activity lifecycle. The line between getting things done more efficiently and getting sucked into a whirlpool of memory leaks can seem mighty thin, but it can be walked. In this talk, Ellen will discuss how she's walked it, what's worked -- and what definitely has not.\n\nResources:\nKotlinConf website: https://jb.gg/fyaze5\nKotlinConf on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlinconf\n\nKotlin website: https://jb.gg/pxrsn6\nKotlin blog: https://jb.gg/7uc7ow\nKotlin on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlin\n\n#KotlinConf19 #Kotlin #JetBrains\n\nAbout the Presenter:\nEllen Shapiro is an iOS and Android developer who's been building native apps since late 2010. She's a co-author of the RayWenderlich.com team's Kotlin Apprentice book, and has written and edited many tutorials and other books for the site as well. When not coding, Ellen can generally be found traveling, biking all over the place, playing sous-chef to her fianc√©e Lilia, and relentlessly Instagramming their cats."
