description: "(Recorded at Jfokus 2016. http://www.jfokus.com)\n\nJavaScript Gotchas\n\nJavaScript is amazing. You can manipulate the language so much which really makes it the land of endless possibilities. However, most JS developers usually run into a few troubles. And by \"a few\" I mean \"a lot\". In this session we will go through these funny yet irritating gotchas, understand them and figure out how to write our code so we never come across them again!\n\nShay Friedman, CodeValue\n\nShay Friedman is the founder and web division leader at CodeValue, and also a Microsoft .NET MVP. In the last years, Shay has migrated numerous companies to modern web technologies like angularjs, html5 and css3. He's spoken in lots of international conferences and conducted various web related courses around the world. In his spare time Shay plays the guitar, plays basketball and drinks beer. And, most important, he's a nice guy! :)"
