description: "In this ver. @csell5 talks with @alzaudtke about the clouds, functional programming, and with sprinkles of good ole software development. \n\n\nAl is an Architect at J. J. Keller & Associates, Inc. with over 15 years of experience working with subscription based web applications. Primarily I work on web applications using the .NET stack, and recently we are working on Cloud Native solutions in Azure. These solutions are not only web applications, but there is also an IoT solution currently being built.\n\nSince spring of 2015, I have been a remote employee. My company is in Wisconsin, and I worked out of the office until my wife and I decided to make a change. I now live in Knoxville, TN and absolutely love being a remote employee. There were some challenges early on, but we worked through them all, and now we have a number of distance employees on our team.\n\nIn addition to designing and building solutions, I am trying to do more presentations. I have presented a few times, but am always looking to challenge myself to give more.\n\n\n@alzaudtke\nhttps://zaudtke.com\nhttps://github.com/zaudtke"
