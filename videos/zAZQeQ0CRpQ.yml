recordingDate: 1468309246
description: "Spring I/O 2016 - 19 -20 May Barcelona\n\nProgressive Web Applications are as easy to find and start using as any webpage, but offer the rich user experience we associate with apps. The user experience is progressively upgraded as the user interacts with the application so that the app can be installed on the device, load faster, work offline and re-engage users through push notifications.\n\nIn this talk we’ll explore what it takes to build a progressive web application – Service Workers, App Shells and Web App Manifests. We’ll then take a practical look at how we can use Spring Boot and Polymer to build a simple Progressive Web Application of our own."
