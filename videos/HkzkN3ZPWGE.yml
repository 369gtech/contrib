description: "Big Data Direct -- The Era of Self-driven Big Data Exploration\n\nIn recent years, \"Big Data\" has matured from a vague description of massive corporate data to a household term that refers to not just volume but the diversity of data and velocity of change. Today, there's a wealth of data trapped in corporate data repositories, new platforms like Hadoop, a new generation of data marketplaces and volumes generated hourly on the Web. With the opportunity for key insights that these diverse data sources present, the business user's ability to get to the data when they need it and gleam fast insights has become a massive priority. In a nutshell, easing access and analysis of both private and public data is one of the biggest opportunities ahead. New approaches to enable self-driven exploration of private and public data are necessary and will help address the critical 'last mile' problem in big data. Big Data Direct discusses the opportunity ahead for business users to intuitively and easily harness the power of private and public data for deeper customer intelligence and to identify new business opportunities.\n\nhttp://strataconf.com/stratany2012/public/schedule/detail/26203"
