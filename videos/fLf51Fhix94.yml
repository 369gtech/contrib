description: "Automatically Detect the Top Performance & Scalability Issues in Distributed Architectures\n\nAndreas Grabner, Dynatrace\n\nIn 2019, I helped 100+ teams analyze performance and architectural issues in their distributed applications. In this session, I present the common patterns such as N+1 Call & Query, Payload Flood, Too Granular, Tight Coupling, Bad Timeouts/Retries/Backoff, and Inefficient Dependencies. I teach you how you can detect these patterns yourself fully automated in your CI/CD pipeline using the CNCF project Keptn and its SLI/SLO based Quality Gate approach.\n\nView the full SREcon20 Americas program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon20americas/program"
