language: English
recordingDate: 1433514908
description: "This session covers the newly released Gradle-based build system for the Android SDK. This build system uses proper dependency management, allows for bundle distributions of libraries, and supports the development of applications across a wide variety of Android devices. You will see a demonstration of the current Android build system and get a glimpse of whatâ€™s being developed for the next generation of Android builds. The presentation briefly introduces Gradle and focuses on generic features developed as part of the ongoing Android integration work. It also shows how these new features are useful for other non-Java-based platforms such as JavaScript, Scala, and C++.\n\n\nAuthor:\nHans Dockter\nHans Dockter is the founder and project lead of Gradle and the CEO of Gradle Inc..
