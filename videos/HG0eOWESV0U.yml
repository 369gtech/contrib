description: "This talk will walk though using Perl with the distributed key store etcd. I will also share a few new modules that I have been working on (Etcd3 and Dancer2::Plugin:Etcd) providing Perl and Dancer developers with cloud based authentication, and configuration management/storage options for their apps.\n\n\nSam is a Linux system administrator and developer whose specialties include ecommerce, custom development platforms, Perl Dancer, DBIx::Class and cloud technologies. He is passionate about solving problems with open source solutions."
