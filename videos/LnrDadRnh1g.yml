description: "We developed a Spring and Geode architecture, in conjunction with probabilistic data structures (Yahoo Theta Sketches) which: \n- significantly improves our platform performance through novel use of probabilistic data structures to perform set operations \n- reduces operating costs by 95% over our previous HBase implementation (dramatically reduces the number of servers needed) \n- increases scalability (we can grow horizontally to support more users and/or data) \n- simplifies operations (batch processing replaced with an event-driven architecture) \n- increases resiliency (shared nothing, self-healing containerized cloud architecture)\nJoin us to learn all about it!\n\nSpeakers:\nEvan Benoit\nSenior Partner Integrator, Team Lead, Resonate\n\nSharif Ghazzawi\nSenior Software Engineer, Resonate\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
