recordingDate: 1609873269
description: "Talk \nConstantly waiting for your data processing code to finish executing? Through real-life stories and analogies, we will explore how to leverage on parallel and asynchronous programming in Python to speed up your data processing pipelines - so that you could focus more on getting value out of your data.\n\n\nSpeaker\nChin Hwee Ong is a data engineer, aspiring polymath and Industry 4.0 enthusiast who happens to have a background in aerospace engineering and computational modelling. As an avid user of the pandas library and a beneficiary of open source, Chin Hwee enjoys sharing about data manipulation using pandas and has a not-so-secret wish for data processing codes to run faster.\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
