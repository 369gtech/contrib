description: "Originally recorded on May 8, 2014. Congratulations, you're getting users to come to your site or download your product! Now you just need to figure out why they're leaving without becoming real users.\n\nIn this webcast, Laura Klein author of UX for Lean Startups will explain the three ways your product may be failing to convert visitors into users or users into customers. By improving your real conversion rate, you'll grow your product faster and more cheaply, because you won't be wasting time and money acquiring users who will never deliver value to your company.\n\nAbout Laura Klein:\nLaura has spent 15 years as an engineer and designer. Her goal is to help lean startups learn more about their customers so that they can build better products faster. Her popular design blog, Users Know, teaches product owners exactly what they need to know to do just enough research and design. She currently offers consulting and training in Lean UX for startups and large companies.\n\nDon't miss an upload!
