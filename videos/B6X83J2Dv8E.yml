description: 'Apache Cordova, a project enabling web developers to build native applications for several different mobile platforms using open web technologies, and its community has been working feverishly on creating awesome tooling for our users during the past year. The tooling includes ways to create cross-platform native mobile applications with web technologies, right from your command line, as well as installing little bundles of JavaScript and native code to extend the capabilities of your hybrid applications with arbitrary device functionality (plugins, in the Cordova world). In this talk, Mike and Fil will go through their experience building command-line tools using node.js, what revisions and rewrites they had to endure, patterns they''ve converged on, and tips and tricks to share with the community.'
