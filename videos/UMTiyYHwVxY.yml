description: "Data collection by itself does not provide business values. IoT solutions must ingest, process, make decisions, and take actions to create value. This module focuses on data acquisition, data ingestion, and the data processing aspect of IoT solutions to maximize value from data. \n\nAs a device developer, you will learn about message types, approaches to serializing messages, the value of metadata and IoT Plug and Play to streamline data processing on the edge or in the cloud.\n\nIoT Plug and Play: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-pnp/overview-iot-plug-and-play?WT.mc_id=sciot-video-cxa\n\nAs a solution architect, you will learn about approaches to stream processing on the edge or in the cloud with Azure Stream Analytics, selecting the right storage based on the volume and value of data to balance performance and costs, as well as an introduction to IoT reporting with Power BI.\n\nAzure Stream Analytics: https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/data/stream-processing-stream-analytics?WT.mc_id=sciot-video-cxa\nPower BI documentation: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/?WT.mc_id=sciot-video-cxa\nCheck out more on Microsoft Learn: https://aka.ms/IoTelp20"
