title: 'Pydata Berlin November 2020: Can we teach machines how to be moral?'
language: English
recordingDate: 1606558372
description: "Morality is often seen as something distinctly human; in that it would be impossible for a machine to make moral decisions. In this presentation, combining philosophy, cognitive science, and computing, I introduce the area of Machine Ethics: the pursuit to make machines that can decide between right and wrong. I present motivations for creating such machines, and discuss the idea that a teaching model might be the key to their creation\nAbstract:\n\nBio: Rebecca Raper is a final year PhD candidate and senior consultant in Ethical AI at Oxford Brookes University. She has a background in philosophy and psychology, but is now working within computing, tackling the area of machine ethics to try and find a suitable way to teach machines how to become moral. Combining developmental psychology with ethics and machine learning techniques, she is working on developing a system that is taught morals from a role model.\nHer interests include formal logic, metaphysics and cognitive science. She also has a wider interest in Ethical AI and has been working to develop a Risk Classification System for AI Systems as a consultant in The Institute for Ethical AI.\n\n\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
