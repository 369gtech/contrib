description: "Teachable Machine is an experiment that makes it easier for anyone to start exploring how machine learning works. It lets you teach a machine using your camera – live in the browser, no coding required. It’s built with a library called deeplearn.js, which makes it easier for any web developer to get into machine learning, by training and running neural nets right in the browser.\n\nThis experiment was a collaborative effort by friends from Støj (http://www.stoj.io), Use All Five (https://useallfive.com) and Creative Lab and PAIR teams at Google.\n\nCheck out the demo: https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/\n\nGet the code: https://goo.gl/HWuSg8\n\nCheck out more A.I.
