We will take a look at how to model your microservices with Bounded Contexts and Strategic Design, after that we will dive into a Microservice and look at how to implement Aggregates, Repositories and how to work with Domain Events. All the implementation details will leverage various Spring technologies such as Spring Boot, -Data and -Cloud. This talk consists of a bit of theroy and a lot of code."
