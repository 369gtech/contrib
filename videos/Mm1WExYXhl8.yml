On my first day I was given a Wyse 60 terminal attached via RS232 cables to a Tandon 286, and told to learn C from a dead tree so I could write text applications for an 80x24 character screen. Fast-forward to now: my phone is about a million times more powerful than that Tandon; screens are 3840x2160 pixels; everything in the world is networked to every other thing with no cables, and we code using… well, still basically C.\nHaving lived through all those changes in real time, and as an incurable neophile, I think I can make an educated guess as to what the next 30 years are going to be like, and what we're all going to be doing by 2050. If anything, I'm going to underestimate it, but hopefully you'll be inspired, invigorated and maybe even informed about the future of your career [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n01:18 History\n10:31 Present\n25:41 Modern primitive technology\n33:29 Future\n43:28 Outro\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotopia.eu/november-2020/sessions/1639/futurology-for-dummies-the-next-30-years-in-tech\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#Futurology #FutureOfTech #Technology #SoftwareEngineering #Programming #QuantumComputing #QuantumProgramming #AI #ML #3DPrinting #IoT #ConnectedWorld\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
