description: "Google associates search problems with solutions - it's an association engine. Search on Google for 'parse a CSV file'. Where is Perl? Where is Raku? CPAN and modules.raku.org are full of solutions! When programmers have a problem we want them to find Perl and Raku solutions.\n\nSCRPans is a proposal for a new TPF sponsored code sharing site for Perl and Raku, powered by our community and backed by CPAN and modules.raku.org. Think ....  Stackoverflow meets RosettaCode.\n\nThis talk presents a mock user interface and proposes an MVP site and next steps. Give your feedback. Leave search trails to Perl and Raku. Support SRCPans."
