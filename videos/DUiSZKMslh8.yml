Go!, Diana Ortega\n\nImagine that you need to develop an Optical Character Recognition system using neural networks. Why is not Go your first choice for this kind of project? In this talk Diana will show you a traditional solution using Tensorflow and python, and also, how we can achieve a similar result using Go.\nBuild a deep learning project can be a challenging task. So, choosing the right tools is critical. In which level is the Go language ready to help developers and data scientists to create models for prediction? \nDuring this presentation she's going to show the generalities of the implementation of a model for OCR using first Tensorflow, which is one of the most popular frameworks in the market."
