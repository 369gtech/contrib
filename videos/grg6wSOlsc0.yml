recordingDate: 1493242561
description: "This talk will\_explore\_people's instinct to retreat from fear,\_and challenge\_attendees to instead embrace,\_even enjoy\_their fears. We will discuss fear's positive effects—especially when it comes to motivation—when understood and accepted with a clear mind.\_In this talk Joe will share some personal accounts, as well as his own struggles with:\_impostor syndrome, a fear of success, and procrastination.\_Sharing how his experience in becoming friends with his fears has positively impacted his career and personal life/relationships,\_making him a better & more empathetic person.\n\nWith the goal of\_presenting\_an alternate perspective of how we perceive\_fear, this talk will\_provide\_support to those who feel ashamed to admit they are afraid;\_encouraging them to, instead, wear their\_fear as a badge of honor, and consider\_why consciously\_running toward their fears can be of great benefit."
