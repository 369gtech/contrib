description: "This video was recorded at RabbitMQ Summit 2021 - https://rabbitmqsummit.com\n\nMore great virtual tech conferences - https://codesync.global \n\n---\n\nIntroducing stream support in RabbitMQ\nby Arnaud Cogoluègnes\n\nABSTRACT\nRabbitMQ is driving an effort to implement a log-type data structure, with stream support on top of the AMQP 0-9-1 protocol and a new blazing fast protocol created for the occasion. Streams unlock scenarios that could have been tedious to implement in the old days of RabbitMQ: large fan-outs, replay & time travel, large logs, very high throughput (1 million messages per second on a 3-node cluster).\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - Arnaud Cogoluègnes\nArnaud is a staff engineer at VMware, working on the RabbitMQ core team on the broker, client libraries, and tooling. Despite all his efforts to tame the Erlang platform, he is still kindly referred to as the \"Java guy\" when his teammates can not remember his name.\n\n---\n\nRabbitMQ Summit\nWebsite: https://rabbitmqsummit.com\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/RabbitMQSummit"
