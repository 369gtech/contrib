description: "Recording brought to you by American Express https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs\nOne of the best places to learn idiomatic Kotlin is the stdlib. Now I don’t mean just using the stdlib but going to the source, literally. In this session, we’ll look at some of the methods and tools inside the stdlib and dig into how they’re written to reveal intermediate to advanced language features, slick syntax and conventions, and high-level abstractions to help you write more fluent objects and interfaces. We’ll also take a few glances at the underlying bytecode to understand how and why the features work the way they do.\n\nAbout the Presenter:\nHuyen Tue Dao is an Android developer and Google Developer Expert, currently working on the Trello Android app at Atlasssian. She is also co-creator of the \"Android Dialogs\" YouTube channel.\n \nHuyen lives in Denver, CO though is often found in the DC Metro area. When not up late programming, she is often found up late gaming (video, board, card, anything)."
