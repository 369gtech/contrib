description: "Build Stuff's #3 e-Meetup second guest was Hannes Lowette - .NET developer, speaker, and coach\n\nStatically generated sites are the future. Seriously. With frameworks like Nuxt we can build really cool sites that look and feel like a single page application but are actually static generated. That means no need for a server but most importantly performance is amazing. Everything is generated at build time"
