description: "by Radomir Dopieralski\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/UD2.120/python_games_with_micropython.webm\n\n\nMicroPython lets you program your own hardware easily, so why not use it for programming your own games on your own custom handheld game console? And once you have the game console, why not make it super-easy to program and use it for education and workshops? I like making computer games, and I think that everybody should at least try to do it once. Not only it is great fun, but you also learn a lot of useful skills, including the fact that now you can control the computer, and not be controlled by it. But programming games with regular Python is hard, so why not turn to MicroPython and build your own hardware that will make it super-easy to make simple games? And as you gain experience and extend your tool set, you can build better devices and make better games for them. You can even experiment with non-standard control methods and output. In this talk I will tell you how you can start doing this, and I will show you the hardware and games that I made. I will also talk about how I turned one of them into an educational device running CircuitPython and suitable for game-programming workshops. \n\nAfter the talk, I want you to know that:\n1. it's actually pretty easy to make custom gaming hardware these days,\n2. it is still a lot of work to actually make a good computer game,\n3. using high-level languages like Python helps, both beginners and advanced developers. \n\nRoom: UD2.120 (Chavanne)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 13:30:00+01"
