description: "Today's session covers how to  build an API with node.js (Session 8 of the \"Programming from A to Z\" class at ITP http://shiffman.net/a2z/).\n\nIn this episode, I cover introductory steps to building your own RESTful API with node.js. I show you how to install the node framework Express, as well as how to use routes to deal with the GET requests.
