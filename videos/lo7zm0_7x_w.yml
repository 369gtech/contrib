description: "Property-based testing frameworks work by being given a set of properties that you expect your code to obey – and then they try to generate input values that break them.\nWe’ll start with a round-up of what property-based testing is its roots in functional programming, before diving into some practical examples in C# and F# using the .NET property testing library FsCheck.\n\nNo prior knowledge is assumed, and a brief introduction to F# syntax will be given."
