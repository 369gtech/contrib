description: 'redlure can be described as a distributed phishing platform. There is a centralized API (redlure-console) where you can create the different aspects of your phishing campaigns. This console controls secondary servers running a more basic API (redlure-workers) that do the actual hosting of your phishing sites/files and communicate results back to the main server. Obviously there are existing tools that can accomplish phishing, but here are a few features to this tool that differentiate it and will be described in the abstract.'
