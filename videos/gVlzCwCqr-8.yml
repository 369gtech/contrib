description: 'Codemotion Milan 2015 - "Use Ionic framework to develop mobile application" by Lucio Grenzi - In the ever evolving quest for the best mobile application development stacks, it''s time to take a look at the Ionic Framework. Ionic is a library that provides mobile-optimized UI components to build “native-feeling” hybrid applications. Ionic is built on top of AngularJS to provide a complete solution for developing applications that are both well architected and native-feeling. That’s great news if you are an Angular developer. If you use another architectural framework, you can still use the Ionic CSS stylesheets, but you won’t get the powerful UI interactions, gestures, and animations.'
