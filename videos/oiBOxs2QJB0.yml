title: 'Up and Coming Standards in JavaScript Modules'
language: English
recordingDate: 1623870504
description: "ES6 added a built-in concept of modules to JavaScript in 2015, though uptake since then has been more gradual, it is the de-facto default for authoring new JS today. In this talk, Daniel will explain two new proposals in this space, making modules even more useful.\n\nJS module blocks let you run a module in a Worker without splitting the code out into a separate file. This way, it's easier to run code in parallel or keep code reusable, even when bundlers are involved. Resource bundles let browsers understand bundler output better, so they can implement ES module semantics natively and improve loading performance.\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).
