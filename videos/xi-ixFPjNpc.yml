description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM SF 19 http://bit.ly/2T3Do0U\n\nGet involved in Code Sync's next conference http://bit.ly/2Mcm4aS\n\n---\n\nMID-AIR AIRPLANE REPAIR: TROUBLESHOOTING AT WHATSAPP\nby Maxim Fedorov\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nProduction \nSystem \nTroubleshooting\n\nTALK LEVEL: Intermediate\n\nABSTRACT\nSimple, reliable messaging. It takes a lot to support this statement. For 10 years WhatsApp demonstrated unprecedented reliability and availability, serving over 1.5B users. There is absolutely no way to reproduce interactions between all of them, within the cluster spanning over 10,000 nodes and multiple data centers. Investigations must be done on a live system without disturbing connected users. If there are repairs needed, it has to be done on the fly.\n\nThis talk will guide through debugging and troubleshooting techniques used at WhatsApp. Maxim will share a few case studies, explain monitoring, introspection, performance analysis, and tools.\n\nSome knowledge of Erlang and C is necessary.\n\nRead the full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/maxim-fedorov/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - MAXIM FEDOROV\nImpossible takes a little longer\n\nMaxim Fedorov is a software engineer at WhatsApp, the largest messaging app. Maxim’s work is focused on performance and scalability of the server side.\n\nBefore WhatsApp, Maxim has been developing low-latency TCP/IP applications at NetAlliance (Sydney, Australia), designing Kaspersky Enterprise Security Endpoint (Moscow, Russia), improving Parallels Virtual Automation, called Odin now, at Parallels (former SWsoft), and developing network security software before.\n\nMaxim earned a Master’s Degree in Computer Science.\n\nMore on Maxim Fedorov: https://codesync.global/speaker/maxim-fedorov/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM SF 19\nCode BEAM SF is powered by Code Sync.
