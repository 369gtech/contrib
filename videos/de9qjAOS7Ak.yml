He shares how to handle complex logic and flows which require proper reactions on failures, timeouts and compensating actions and provides guidance backed by code examples to illustrate alternative approaches.\nThis presentation was recorded at QCon New York 2018: https://bit.ly/2JFHitG  \n\nThe next QCon is QCon London 2019 - March 4-6, 2019: https://bit.ly/2hxsoN1 \n\nFor more awesome presentations on innovator and early adopter topics check InfoQ’s selection of talks from conferences worldwide https://bit.ly/2tm9loz\n\nInterested in Software Architecture?
