title: 'BB84: Quantum Protected Cryptography'
language: English
recordingDate: 1632942639
description: "A Google TechTalk, presented by Alan Christopher, 2021/08/12\nABSTRACT: The BB84 protocol leverages no-cloning properties of quantum systems to allow two parties -- Alice and Bob -- to negotiate a shared secret which is impervious to an attacker -- Eve -- with unlimited mathematical sophistication and computational resources. This talk covers core, \"textbook\" BB84, as well as the post-processing procedures necessary to create a practical cryptographic protocol from it."
