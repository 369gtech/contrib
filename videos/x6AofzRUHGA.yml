description: "Taking place July 20-24, 2014. Once considered a radical upstart, open source has moved from disruption to default. Its methods and culture commoditized the technologies that drove the Internet revolution and transformed the practice of software development. Collaborative and transparent, open source has become modus operandi, powering the next wave of innovation in cloud, data, and mobile technologies.\n\nBook your ticket! http://www.oscon.com/oscon2014\n\nOSCON is where all of the pieces come together: developers, innovators, businesspeople, and investors. In the early days, this trailblazing O'Reilly event was focused on changing mainstream business thinking and practices; today OSCON is about real-world practices and how to successfully implement open source in your workflow or projects. While the open source community has always been viewed as building the futureâ€”that future is here, and it's everywhere you look. Now in its 16th year, OSCON is the best place on the planet to experience the open source ecosystem. At OSCON, you'll find everything open source: languages, communities, best practices, products and services. Rather than focus on a single language or aspect, such as cloud computing, OSCON allows you to learn about and practice the entire range of open source technologies.\n\nIn keeping with its O'Reilly heritage, OSCON is a unique gathering where participants find inspiration, confront new challenges, share their expertise, renew bonds to community, make significant connections, and find ways to give back to the open source movement. The event has also become one of the most important venues to announce groundbreaking open source projects and products.\n\nDon't miss an upload!
