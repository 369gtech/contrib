title: 'Intro To Graph Neural Networks || Kefei Hu'
language: English
recordingDate: 1623093183
description: "A graph is a data structure consisting of two components, nodes and edges. It is useful for modelling relationships and interactions between interconnected entities.\n\nMany types of data can naturally be represented this way, such as social networks, molecule interactions or even websites. Leveraging the relational structure gives us the potential to build more accurate models for classification, prediction and clustering.\n\nThis talk introduces Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), a class of models designed to perform inference on such interconnected data. They are well suited for a wide range of applications from drug discovery to recommender systems and traffic prediction.\n\nWe will cover the theory of GNNs, specifically how they work and scale to large graphs, as well as a small demo of a GNN for entity classification using Stellar Graph.\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nPyData provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish PyData Talks. \n\nCREDITS:\nPyData YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOjD18EJYcsBog4IozkF_7w"
