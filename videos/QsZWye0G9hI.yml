title: 'Pilot Decision Management - Clifford Agius'
recordingDate: 1533736593
description: "This talk explores Clifford's experience as a Boeing 787 Dreamliner Pilot and the critical decision management skills required therein.\nAs an Airline pilot, you may be required to make a decision often quickly to react to a situation as it presents itself and you will discover a way to achieve this called TDODAR. This model ensures that you achieve a safe outcome for all on board and Clifford often finds himself using the same model when facing a problem whilst wearing his Dev hat and it's yet to fail him."
