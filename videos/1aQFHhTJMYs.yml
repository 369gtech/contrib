description: "Planning out and building a full project can be tricky. The best way to get better at building projects is to practice so, we are going to practice a full project as part of the weekly challenge. Each week we will take on a new piece of the challenge. This week, we are going to plan out our project. \n\nPlanning is a critical part of the journey. Get it wrong and you will be pointed in the wrong direction and no matter how hard you work, you will not hit your goal. Let's practice doing it right.\n\nChallenge Page (with solution): https://www.iamtimcorey.com/courses/c-weekly-challenges/lectures/13201968\nSubscribe to Solutions: https://www.iamtimcorey.com/p/c-weekly-challenges\n\nPractice makes perfect, right? Well, mostly, but practice is very important. This series is all about getting you to practice the things you learn. I would encourage you to do every one. See which ones are just easy refreshers and which ones are difficult learning experiences."
