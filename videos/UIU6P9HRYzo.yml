They can help uncover hidden problems and blockers, improve processes, increase morale, and even make your products better. However, a lot of teams go through the motions of retros without really understanding the method behind the madness. They end up doing the same old “What went well, what didn’t go well” format over and over again, with diminishing returns.\n\nIt’s important to use the right tool for the right job - there are actually a variety of different types of retrospectives you can use, and each one has unique strengths and weaknesses. I’ll discuss five different types of retros you can add to the mix to keep things fresh. I’ll explain when, how and why to use each type of retro with your team, along with some tips on how to best facilitate the event.\n\nABOUT JESSIE LINK\n\nJessie is a Director of Engineering at Twitter.
