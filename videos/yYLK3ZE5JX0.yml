title: 'Deep Dive into Deep Learning with MXNet by Randall Hunt'
language: English
recordingDate: 1510145250
description: "Deep Learning is a serious discipline that is taking over many of the software development problems, and taking them from the cold world of data centers and servers, to the warm world of human lives. Computers now can see, hear, sense and understand, like and sometimes better than humans, using deep learning. In this session, we will talk about the main concepts of Deep Learning, symbols such as perceptron, convolutional neural networks (CNN), activation, pooling, recurrent neural networks (RNN), embedding, auto-encoders and deep structured semantic models (DSSM). You’ll learn how Deep Learning is related to Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. You’ll also learn how to get started with and develop Deep Learning systems. We will build together a few Deep Learning models, using Python with Apache MXNet, and deploy them as a service to be used by other parts of your systems. Integration with multiple AWS services will be shown and explained as well.\n\n# Randall Hunt\nTechnical Evangelist and Software Engineer at @aws and @awslabs. Formerly of SpaceX, NASA, and @mongodb"
