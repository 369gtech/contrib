description: "Tensorflow is one of the most popular Open Source projects on Github and definitely, the one most popular Machine Learning library out there. On the other hand, DeepLearning is one of the hottest topics discussed around. Why so much attention? What are these technology, frameworks and how one can make use if them?\n\nIn the talk, we start with base concepts of machine learning, explaining tensors and advantages of Tensorflow, shifting more into the direction of practical examples of how one can apply mentioned technologies without going too deep into mathematics.\n\nWe cover high-level API like Keras. How to utilize knowledge and computing resources of such huge companies like Google and Facebook with a technique called Transfer Learning. And finally bringing a few examples how such systems might be deployed to production systems with Kubernetes and Tensorflow Serving.\n\nTalk by Sergii Khomenk.\n\nVideo recorded at the GDG DevFest Ukraine - the biggest conference about Google technologies in Central and Eastern Europe.\nLearn about the conference at https://devfest.gdg.org.ua/\nMore recordings at http://bit.ly/devfestua-channel\n\n--\n\nLearn to code for free and get a developer job: https://www.freecodecamp.org\n\nRead hundreds of articles on programming: https://medium.freecodecamp.org\n\nAnd subscribe for new videos on technology every day: https://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=freecodecamp"
