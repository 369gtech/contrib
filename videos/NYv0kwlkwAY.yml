description: "Slides: http://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/the-five-stages-of-cloud-native\n\nThe value of embracing microservices, containers, and continuous delivery is powerful only when brought together in logical, scalable, and portable ways. When used incorrectly it’s increasingly easy to make things much worse for you and your team, and do it at scale. For example, while microservices can be used to effectively isolate functionality, increase the speed of delivery, and help scale your team it can also be a way to inefficiently duplicate functionality and create single points of failure. I’ll share anti-patterns and corresponding best practices based on my experience building application infrastructure and platforms, as well as the applications which are deployed to them.\n\nSpringOne Platform 2016 \nSpeaker: Casey West; Principal Technologist, Pivotal"
