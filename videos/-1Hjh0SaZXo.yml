description: "Speaker: Ryusuke Kajiyama, Oracle Corporation Japan\n\nDescription:\nThere’s a lot of excitement around NoSQL Data Stores with the\npromise of simple access patterns, flexible schemas, scalability and\nHigh Availability. The downside comes in the form of losing ACID\ntransactions, consistency, flexible queries and data integrity checks.\nWhat if you could have the best of both worlds? This session shows\nhow MySQL Cluster provides simultaneous SQL and native NoSQL\naccess to your data – whether a simple key-value API (Memcached),\nREST, JavaScript, Java or C++. You will hear how the MySQL\nCluster architecture delivers in-memory real-time performance,\n99.999% availability, on-line maintenance and linear, horizontal\nscalability through transparent auto-sharding.\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/WCjd/"
