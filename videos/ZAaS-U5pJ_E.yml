description: "This video was recorded at the Erlang Factory in Munich on the 19th of February. slides are available here: \n\nDevelopers are often required to make different components of a system communicate. HTTP is a common protocol to bind two different parts of a system, but HTTP is slow and difficult to use. Sometimes you just need to send a few values at a time and don't need the overhead of HTTP.\n\nThe msgpack serialization library can be used to build one such custom protocol. It is available on pretty much any platform you can think of, is small and efficient, and most importantly it allows you to build very readable protocol code.\n\nThis talk will explain how to build a simple custom protocol with Ranch and msgpack and will demonstrate the simplicity of connecting two different systems.\n\nTalk objectives: Learn how to build custom protocols based on Ranch and msgpack."
