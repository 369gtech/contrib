In fact, by 2021 it’s estimated that video will represent 82% of all IP traffic! If you’re not doing video today, what’s wrong with you? No seriously, of course, it’s tough to crush it all areas, I get it, you’ve got enough to worry about…but video has two important elements that agencies, brands, and SEOs need to get right – Content & Search Optimization.\n\nIn this keynote, I’ll walk through how you can do video right, from start to finish. I’ll walk through step-by-step on creating high-performance video that is searchable, clickable, viewable and shareable.\n\nI’ll show you the exact steps I took to go from 0 YouTube subscribers to 10,000 in less than a year and zero views to over 500,000 views.\n\nKey takeaways:\n\n1. How to produce video that performs\n\n2. How to make video searchable and clickable\n\n3. How to milk it for all it’s worth\n\nThe speech was given on 2018-05-22 at infoShare 2018 (Marketing Stage) in Gdańsk.\n\nMore info: http://infoshare.pl \nFollow us: https://facebook.com/infosharepl\nhttps://twitter.com/infosharepl\nhttps://instagram.com/infoshare/\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/1272775/\nhttps://plus.google.com/+infoshare/"
