description: "Almost half of daily internet access occurs via mobile with the average user engaging with their device over 2500 times per day! \n\n25+ Mobile Stats to Know in 2020: https://fueled.com/blog/mobile-stats/?WT.mc_id=SDC-8397-cassieb\n\nAnd while many have 80+ apps installed, most users engage with less than 10 apps on a regular basis, with ~40% of apps being uninstalled due to lack of use. What does this mean to you as a new developer? Mobile app development is both a huge opportunity and a constant challenge. In this talk we'll look at the mobile development landscape â€“ from native apps to multi-platform development and mobile web. We'll talk about design challenges and personalizing user experiences to match diverse contexts. And we'll look  at emerging paradigms in dual-screen and multi-posture devices (e.g., Surface Duo) and talk about how we can leverage these technology advances to rethink the modern mobile app.\n\nBuild dual-screen Xamarin.Forms apps by using TwoPaneView: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/xamarin-forms-dual-screen/?WT.mc_id=SDC-8397-ninarasi\nIntroduction to Dual Screen Devices: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dual-screen/introduction?WT.mc_id=SDC-8397-ninarasi"
