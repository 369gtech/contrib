description: "Em Campbell-Pretty, Partner, Context Matters\n\n“Birds flock, fish school, people “tribe”.” – David Logan\n\nPeople naturally form tribes. It is just what we do. However, not all tribes are equally effective. Just like with regular teams it is the culture of the tribe that dictates its effectiveness. When it comes to succeeding with DevOps in the enterprise context it is necessary to think beyond the individual development and operations teams to all the teams involved in enhancing and maintaining the value stream, the entire tribe. When we launch DevOps initiatives we can get so focused on improving technical practices and how individual roles will change that we can easily forget to help the teams involved bond, foster a sense of belonging, shape their values and instil respect for one another. Succeeding with DevOps in the enterprise context requires explicitly creating and sustaining these attributes, building a culture beyond team’s individual identity to create a sense of tribal unity. In this session, Em will share with you her experiences and proven techniques for helping teams become effective and unified tribes."
