title: 'USENIX ATC ''19 - Accelerating Rule-matching Systems with Learned Rankers'

description: "Zhao Lucis Li, University of Science and Technology China; Chieh-Jan Mike Liang and Wei Bai, Microsoft Research; Qiming Zheng, Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Yongqiang Xiong, Microsoft Research; Guangzhong Sun, University of Science and Technology China\n\nInfusing machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) into modern systems has driven a paradigm shift towards learning-augmented system design. This paper proposes the learned ranker as a system building block, and demonstrates its potential by using rule-matching systems as a concrete scenario. Specifically, checking rules can be time-consuming, especially complex regular expression (regex) conditions. The learned ranker prioritizes rules based on their likelihood of matching a given input. If the matching rule is successfully prioritized as a top candidate, the system effectively achieves early termination. We integrated the learned rule ranker as a component of popular regex matching engines: PCRE, PCRE-JIT, and RE2. Empirical results show that the rule ranker achieves a top-5 classification accuracy at least 96.16%, and reduces the rule-matching system latency by up to 78.81% on a 8-core CPU.\n\nView the full USENIX ATC '19 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc19/technical-sessions"
