description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nDiscussion & Comments: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2019\n—\nSome tasks are projected to take a long time to complete, and many take more time than planned. We didn't plan for it at the onset, but putting std::atomic into CUDA will have taken almost 10 years when it's all over. Many exceptional engineers contributed, everyone learned a lot, I would do it again 100%.\n\nIn this talk I will share 10 stories from the trenches in the 10-year arc of this \"one task\", each with a concise lesson I learned and/or a word about people that made a big difference. You will get a glimpse of what it's like to work on a hardware team, take a quick dive into a seminal computer science thesis, learn the basics of a computer modeling language called Alloy, get a tour of the libcxx ＜atomic＞ header... and more!\_\n— \nOlivier Giroux\nNVIDIA\nDistinguished Engineer\n\nOlivier Giroux has worked on nine GPU and five SM architecture generations released by NVIDIA. Most recently, he's been working to clarify the forms and semantics of valid GPU programs, present and future. He was the programming model lead for the NVIDIA Volta architecture. He is the chair of SG1, the concurrency and parallelism study group of the ISO C++ committee.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
