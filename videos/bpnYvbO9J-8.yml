recordingDate: 1635787802
description: "At Pinterest, stream processing is essential for discovering data insights in real-time for many use cases such as ads reporting, ML signals, and real-time experimentation. Troubleshooting and performance tuning are two major factors affecting developer velocity and requires significant platform support capacity, which ultimately restricts the scalability of streaming use cases at Pinterest. DrSquirrel is a diagnosis tool that not only surfaces and aggregates job symptoms but also dives deep into the root cause and provides a solution with actionable steps towards operation automation. This talk will cover an overview of DrSquirrel features, how we designed and built this self-service diagnosis tool, and how it provides signals that will further enable job auto-tuning and CICD.\n\n0:00 Intro\n1:40 Stream Processing Platform (SPP) Overview \n4:33 Challenges in Flink Adoption\n6:31 Pain Points in Troubleshooting\n10:22 Dr. Squirrel Feature Walkthrough\n18:06 Dr. Squirrel Architecture\n20:17 Future Work"
