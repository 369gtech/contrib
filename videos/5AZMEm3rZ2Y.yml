description: "http://www.cppcon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2014\n--\nTony Grue & Steven Kabbes \"From the Dropbox Trenches: A Deep Dive into Two Cross-Platform Mobile Apps Written in C++\"\n--\nAt Dropbox we’ve spent the last year and a half building two cross platform mobile apps: the email client, Mailbox, and the photo gallery, Carousel. We started with the goal of a native look and feel with seamless performance but also needed to leverage a small team to build these apps on multiple platforms. We ultimately accomplished this by using C++ to share significant amounts of code in each app.\n\nWe’ll cover what portions of our apps we built in C++ and why we left some portions in the platform languages of Java and Objective-C, deep diving into some of the most important components. We’ll also discuss some unexpected benefits, areas we faced technical and human challenges, and some tips and tricks that you can use to leverage C++ to build very high performance apps.\n--\nTony Grue has been building mobile applications, mostly in C++, for the last 8 years.  He worked on Dropbox for Android as it grew from a few million to more than 100 million installs. Now he leads the Carousel for Android and lib-carousel teams at Dropbox. Before Dropbox, Tony was at Microsoft where he contributed to the email, SMS, and visual search clients on Windows Phone.\n--\nSteven Kabbes is a mobile engineer at Dropbox. He was a member of the founding team of Mailbox and designed many of the core email sync algorithms that power it. Since then he has been working on cross platform mobile building the C++ layer of Mailbox which powers clients on iOS, Android and Mac. Steven is especially passionate about developer libraries, specifically ones that enable fast iteration on the next generation of products.\n--\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
