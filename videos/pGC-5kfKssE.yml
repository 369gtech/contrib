description: "Armed with Photoshop, Deke tackles the case of the weird bathroom sign and what you shouldn't throw in an airplane toilet! We don't all speak English, and tourism is a huge industry, so signs need to be language-independent. Naturally, readily identifiable symbols play a key role. Learn what works and what really, really doesn't in this laugh-out-lout episode of dekePod.\r\n\r\nGet more from Deke at deke.com."
