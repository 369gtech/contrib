description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io\n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nService Mesh: There and Back Again - Hema Lee & Cody Vandermyn, Nordstrom \n\nYou might have heard about service mesh and its amazing benefits. Maybe you believe it’s the next big thing, but will it truly meet expectations? As any start to a relationship, things look fun and easy but once we talk performance at scale, compliance with internal security policies, and seamless onboarding, you might reconsider taking it home to meet your parents!  With a highly distributed system that includes services running on Kubernetes clusters along with VM and Serverless workloads, vanilla service mesh would not work for us. In this talk, Hema & Cody will cover how Nordstrom’s relationship with service mesh evolved, what initial results revealed, what surprised us, and the open source contributions and adaptations we made to get to production readiness. We will share lessons learned and hopefully help with your service mesh relationship. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UadC"
