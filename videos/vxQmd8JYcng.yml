description: "Accelerate your Digital Transformation [I] - Michael Dawson, IBM   \n\nDigital transformation is more than a buzz phrase. Learn how companies are evolving to Cloud, systematically leveraging existing workloads on their current platforms for competitive advantage. This session explores the transition to Cloud using Node.js technologies and unlocking the power of your existing data sets and what you can expect from the Node.js Foundation and community moving forward. See how the ability to start on known and familiar platforms and environments and to maintain a bridge to data on these platforms using new technologies like Node.js can be one of the keys to success of the move to cloud native. \n\nCome learn about the work IBM is doing to ensure to that:\n- Node.js is available across platforms and environments\n- that key tools and capabilities are available (monitoring, post mortem investigation)\n- you can leverage existing datasets in your cloud native applications using the IBM SDK for Node.js is based on the Node.js™ open source project. It provides a compatible solution for IBM Power™, Intel® and z Systems™ products that require Node.js functionality and package management.\n\nMichael Dawson\nIBM\nSenior Software Developer\nOttawa, Ontario\nTwitter Tweet\nMichael Dawson is an active contributor to Node.js and a CTC member.
