description: "A Chinese scientist recently claimed to have created the first genetically modified human embryos. Using a technology called CRISPR, he made twin baby girls resistant to HIV before they were born. This opened up serious debate across the world on the implications of this technology. I'm going to take this opportunity to give an in-depth analysis of biotechnology, and and answer some really hard questions. Can we really program biology, and if so how? What are the implications of designer babies? Should humans live forever? I really put my heart into this video, I hope you find it useful and inspiring.
