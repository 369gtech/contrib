description: "As often happens with new technologies, the initial hype and enthusiasm can potentially disrupt years of best practices. Serverless developers may quickly end up with a lot of untestable spaghetti code, followed by a drastic productivity drop. Filippo will showcase how to build a Node.js app powered by TDD to write high-quality and maintainable code in a serverless world.\n\nJeffConf Milan - 29 September 2017\nhttps://milan.jeffconf.com"
