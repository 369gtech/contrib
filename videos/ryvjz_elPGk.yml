The CNCF Research User Group’s purpose is to serve as a focal point for the discussion and advancement of Research Computing using “Cloud Native” technologies. Since the group’s inception 6 months ago, key areas have been identified as gaps within the ecosystem. This session would serve as an opportunity to share with a broader audience some of the key challenges the Research-user-group has identified, and showcase project updates on key tools that the research community is developing to address these challenges.
