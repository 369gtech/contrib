language: English
recordingDate: 1487334950
description: "Nowadays microservices are an established architecture style. By implementing this new challenges arise: you need a high degree of automation and knowledge sharing in your organization. Knowledge about functions, dependencies, infrastructure components and api capabilities is widely spread over multiple teams.\n\nHow does a developer know which services are already in production? And with which functionalities? Where is the source code and corresponding build chain? Who is responsible for answering product related questions?\n\nIn this talk you will learn about possible solutions for service and api discovery with integrated documentation."
