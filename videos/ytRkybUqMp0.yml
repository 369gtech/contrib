description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2014.\nSpeaker: Grant Shipley, RedHat\nDeveloping for the Cloud Track\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/spring-your-apps-into-the-cloud-with-a-paa-s\nWhether you have one or a million visitors accessing your Spring web app, they are all going to demand a great user experience regardless of what it takes for you to deliver it. This invariably means quick page loads and fast response times every single time. When things go south, you just throw more hardware at the problem and increase your caches and buffers, right? Wrong. Toss in an infrastructure that resides on the cloud and now you’ve got a really interesting problem on your hands. I’ll leave the marketecure slides at the door, this is a hands-on technical talk in which we’ll deploy an application to the cloud and then turn up the heat by leveraging the right mix of elasticity and auto-sclaing."
