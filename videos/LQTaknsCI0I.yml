description: "Caskey L. Dickson\nhttp://linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/197/\nThe hardest thing about writing games (after gamplay, mechanics, ux, marketing and paying the bills) is managing the game state as viewed by all users.  This talk will cover the principles of distributed shared state, strategies such as frequent state regeneration, change validation and how your choice of connectivity and latency profiles change the user experience."
