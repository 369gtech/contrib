description: "MobileOptimized 2020, Online – November 6-7, 2020\n\nА historical account of memory leaks in Android, Amanda Hinchman\n\nMemory and threading in Android is some of the most difficult topics in Android. This talk takes a light-hearted approach at some of the colorful developments Android has gone through over the years from why AsyncTask had been deprecated to the eventual evolution of structured concurrency in Kotlin. To truly understand the quirks of the history of memory leaks in Android requires some historical contexting, empathy, and a kinder view of open-source development."
