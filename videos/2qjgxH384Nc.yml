description: "Rob Dodson on Accessibility is My Favorite Part of the Platform\n\nMy favorite part of my job is when I get to work on accessibility. I see this as removing uncertainty and anxiety from people’s day, and helping them access the information they need. But working with accessibility can be frustrating, especially when you feel like you’re fighting the platform instead of working with it.\n\nThis session aims to clear up some of the confusion that makes getting started with accessibility tricky, while showing off new tools to make the process easier, and highlighting ways that we can work with and extend the platform so our apps are accessible to everyone.\n\nCheck out our Accessibility Udacity course at: bit.ly/web-a11y\n\nWatch more Chrome talks at I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/JoMLpB \nSee all the talks from Google I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/olw6kV\nSubscribe to the Chrome Developers channel at http://goo.gl/LLLNvf \n\n#io16 #GoogleIO #GoogleIO2016"
