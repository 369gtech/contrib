description: "This session discusses the present and future of the Java SE Stream API. The first part focuses on effective use of the Stream API, which often requires some tricks/idioms that, when learned, can seem obvious in hindsight. The presentation includes several such tricks. You will then hear about tricks for effective parallel execution, where a set of heuristics is often helpful for gauging whether parallel execution is worthwhile. The second part focuses on the future and what is planned for Java SE 9 and beyond, including new enhancements scheduled for Java 9. Finally, it discusses how Project Valhalla, investigating value types and generics over values, will shape the Stream API and its implementation beyond Java SE 9.\n\nSpeaker:\nPaul Sandoz, Software Engineer, Oracle\nA reformed RESTerfarian who previously co-led JAX-RS and led the implementation Jersey, who moved up into the clouds with the industrious bees of CloudBees, and then boomeranged back to Oracle and deep down into the Java stack."
