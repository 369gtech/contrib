description: "Speaker: Björn Andersson\r\n\r\nBjörn has recently learned about Type Hints (see https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/) and discovered that they can be of tremendous help when refactoring large code-bases. He will show us how you can make use of them today, by integrating them into your IDE and gradually including them into your codebase, one module at a time.\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/Singapore-Python-User-Group/events/244992207/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/ct6s/"
