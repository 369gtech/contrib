description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2013 in Santa Clara, CA\nSpeaker: David Turanski, Luke Taylor\nToday's solutions must provide the ability to interpret related events and understand trends that are happening right now. This session will cover some of the out of the box capabilities of Spring XD to tap into big data streams and generate metrics such as simple counters, aggregate counters, moving averages, rates of change, and histograms. Hands-on demos will show you how Spring XD uses Redis and GemFire's Continuous Query and Function Execution to incorporate real-time analytics into event-driven applications."
