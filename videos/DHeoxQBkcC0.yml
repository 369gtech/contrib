title: 'React Native EU 2021: Grant Sander - Modern Animating in RN - an Introduction to Reanimated V2'
language: English
recordingDate: 1634642931
description: "This talk was presented during the React Native EU 2021 - the largest community conference in the world focused exclusively on React Native.\n\nAbstract:\nAnimation is a crucial element of modern mobile UI development. The JS-to-Native bridge that makes React Native so great also has implications for animation, since declarative and performant animations should be declared on one side of the bridge and executed on the other while making as few trips across the bridge as possible.\nIn this talk, I'll introduce an animation tool, React Native Reanimated 2, and how it helps simplify this mental model for performant animations while providing power-user tools for complex animations. I'll provide some real-world use-cases for Reanimated 2, and how it can fit into your React Native workflow even if you're not an animation expert.\n\nAbout the speaker:\nI am a software engineer that loves using JS to make cool things. I am focused primarily on mobile app development work with React Native, but I also try to stay up to date with the happenings in the web front-end space. I have a formal background in mathematics and education which has led to a soft spot for mobile UX and animation.\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/gksander93\nGithub: https://github.com/gksander\n\nAdditional links:\nSlides and demo materials from the talk:\nhttps://github.com/gksander/rn-eu-2021-reanimated."
