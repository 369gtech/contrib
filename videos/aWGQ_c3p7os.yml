title: 'Introduction to GraphQL - Client Side - Stephen Lau'
recordingDate: 1524137678
description: "A hands-on introduction to GraphQL, the new(ish) query language from Facebook.  GraphQL is built around a simple premise: Ask for what you need, and get exactly that, in a predictable format.\n\nThe language allows us to define our requests in a strongly typed way, we can fetch data across multiple related databases or even APIs and know the shape of data that will be returned.  In this talk we will look at the problem that GraphQL attempts to solve, then fast-forward and see what a GraphQL solution could look like.\n\nWe’ll experiment with GraphQL and see how we can fetch data using the query language.  The talk will look at queries, mutations, variables, fragments, and filters. We will experiment with retrieving different types of data and discuss why we might choose this new standard over a traditional REST API.\n\nStephen Lau is a consultant and teacher at Edument. After starting his career in Canada as a computer engineer doing hardware and firmware design, he’s slowly moved up the stack through firmware, drivers, operating systems, rendering engines, app development, as well as working with cloud deployed server and client side web development. An avid traveler he was in 18 countries last year.\n________________________\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry.
