Software Testing & QA Conference. \nOctober 21, 2016 | www.testcon.lt \n\nThere are often two approaches to quality – get better at finding defects, and get better at reducing the number of escaped defects. This talk focuses firmly on the second option, how to set up teams and organisations that produce high quality products at source.\n\nSurprisingly much of this isn’t about technology, it’s about the mindset of the team, their levels of responsibility and clarity of their goals. These concepts are often wrapped up in the catch all term ‘Employee Engagement’.  It is no coincidence that, as many surveys have demonstrated, high performing organisations are also those with the highest engagement levels."
