title: 'GopherCon 2021: Kevin Dangoor - A Journey from Big Python Monolith to Go Services'
language: English
recordingDate: 1639797449
description: 'Python 2 reached its end-of-life in January 2020 and Khan Academy had a choice of how to move forward with our 10-year-old monolith. They decided on Go and started the long process of porting hundreds of thousands of lines of code. Kevin will talk about what their system looks like, how their GraphQL-based API (using open source tools like gqlgen and genqlient) allowed them to ship incrementally, and how they planned and tracked this large project.'
