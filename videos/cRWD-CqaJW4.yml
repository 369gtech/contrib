description: "TestCon Vilnius 2016. Software Testing & QA Conference. \nOctober 21, 2016 | www.testcon.lt\n\nHeard of Data Governance? Me neither (6 months ago). When you spend most of your time finding defects in your data, you start asking questions like “What’s the point of storing all this cr#*p?”, “What is data quality?”, “Why do we need privacy policy?” That may be a good point to start the Data Governance program within your organization. In my topic I will share our experience of implementing such program: mistakes that we made, bullets that we dodged, and benefits that we gained."
