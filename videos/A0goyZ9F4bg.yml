description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2015.\nSpeaker: Michael Ploed\nCloud Native Track\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/building-microservices-with-event-sourcing-and-cqrs-53211567\nCQRS and Event Sourcing are two architectural patterns that have become very popular through the rise of cloud architectures and No-SQL databases. Both work very well together and take a different take at the handling and storage of data compared to the \"classic enterprise approach\". CQRS splits your application in a read- and a write-part whereas through Event Sourcing the state of your data is represented by sequences of events. This talk introduces both patterns and shows how applications leveraging CQRS and Event Sourcing can be implemented with the Spring Ecosystem.The talk will have slides and live demos."
