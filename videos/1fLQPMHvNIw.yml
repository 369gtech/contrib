title: '"The privacy aspect of TPM attestation" - Imran Desai, Peter Huewe (LCA 2021 Online)'
recordingDate: 1612054847
description: "Imran Desai, Peter Huewe\n\nhttps://lca2021.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/75/\n\nAs digital computing continues to become ubiquitous, it has become indispensable\r\nto accurately measure the trust in the systems we interact with, especially\r\nremotely. With the advent of IoT, platform security, and privacy design goals\r\nand solutions continue to be increasingly variegated. One of the reliable and\r\nstandard choices to accurately assess trust in a system is to use trusted platform\r\nmodules (TPM) to cryptographically prove the system-software-state through a\r\nprocess called attestation.\r\n\r\nAfter a brief introduction to remote attestation, this talk will elicit\r\nthe privacy aspects of remote attestation within the TPM2.0 specification.\r\nWe will explore how specific TPM2 commands work in the context of the\r\nremote attestation use case, highlight which data and information is exchanged\r\nduring the process and point out some features that augment the security and\r\nprivacy of the end-user.\r\n\r\nThis enables system designers to compare and or customize the existing\r\nattestation frameworks to achieve their specific security and privacy goals and\r\nevaluate them for their real-world use cases.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
