description: "\"How to train an image classifier using PyTorch\n[EuroPython 2019 - Talk - 2019-07-10 - Singapore [PyData track]\n[Basel, CH]\n\nBy Rogier van der Geer\n\nNeural networks are everywhere nowadays. But while it seems everyone is using them, training your first neural network can be quite a hurdle to overcome.\n\nIn this talk I will take you by the hand, and following an example image classifier I trained, I will take you through the steps of making an image classifier in PyTorch. I will show you code snippets and explain the more intricate parts. Also, I will tell you about my experience, and about what mistakes to prevent. After this all you need to start training your first classifier is a data set!\n\nOf course I will provide a link to the full codebase at the end. The talk will focus on the practical aspect of training a neural network, and will only touch the theoretical side very briefly. Some basic prior knowledge of neural networks is beneficial, but not required, to follow this talk.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2019.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/"
