description: "What’s new in the world of VMware Open Source? Tiffany and Paul will explore (and try to run!) a number of Open Source projects that VMware is involved in.\n\nYou'll see us run Contour, Harbor, and Velero on a Kubernetes cluster and use Octant to visualize it.\n\n---\n\nTiffany Jernigan\nTiffany is a senior developer advocate at VMware and is focused on Kubernetes. She previously worked as a software developer and developer advocate (nerd whisperer) for containers at Amazon. She also formerly worked at Docker and Intel. Prior to that, she graduated from Georgia Tech with a degree in electrical engineering. In her free time she likes to spend time with her fiancé, family, and friends, as well as dabble in photography. You can find her on Twitter @tiffanyfayj.\n\nPaul Czarkowski\nPaul is a long-time practitioner of the dark arts of DevOps. Hailing from Australia, he moved to Austin,Texas to help build and run one of the largest and most successful online games. Now at VMware, Paul works to improve the operator experience by taking cloud native software development concepts and applying them to operations to create platforms that reduce toil and improve software delivery.\nYou can find him on Twitter @pczarkowski."
