This session shows how JMS 2.0 makes it easier than ever to build enterprise messaging applications in both Java EE and Java SE. Learn about the new simplified JMS API and how it reduces the amount of code you need to write. Find out how to inject JMSContext objects into your code and how they make use of CDI scopes. Hear about the new Java EE resource configuration annotations and how they reduce the amount of configuration you need to do. And hear about the new messaging features introduced in JMS 2.0. The session focuses on real code with lots of examples and a few demonstrations.\n\n\nAuthor:\nNigel Deakin\nNigel Deakin is specification lead for JMS and a principal member of technical staff at Oracle, working on the development of the WebLogic and GlassFish application servers.\n\nBlog: https://jms-spec.java.net\nView more trainings by Nigel Deakin at https://www.parleys.com/author/nigel-deakin-1\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
