description: "This hands-on live-coding session will show you how to use the all-new Spring Tools 4 in Eclipse and Visual Studio Code to be super productive when working on Spring Boot 2 applications. We will show all the new features of the Spring Tools 4, including super fast navigation across your Spring code, deep understanding of your Spring code, and unique support for building reactive web applications using Spring Webflux. We will also dive into the details of how information from live running Spring Boot 2 apps will appear directly in your source code and provide unique insights into your running application - a tremendous help when developing/understanding and debugging your application. You will see why Spring beans are or are not being created and where they are being injected. From those points of injection you will be able to jump straight to their definitions in the source.\n\nSpeakers:\nAlex Boyko\nStaff Software Engineer, Pivotal\nMartin Lippert\nPrincipal Software Engineer, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
