description: "Speaker: Kennard Wicoady\r\n\r\nIn modern era, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) usage is more frequent, especially to increase user experience factor. Such as scanning user’s card’s number or identity card and automatically fill it to form, without user’s direct interaction. Let’s deep down OCR’s origin, how it works, how it creates pattern and learns it to scan, and implement it into Golang-based system.\r\n\r\nAbout the speaker\r\n\r\nKennard is Shopee Indonesia’s Senior Software Engineer and works in order and payment middleware. He is also responsible for developing the gamification features to attract Indonesia’s market for using Shopee applications.
