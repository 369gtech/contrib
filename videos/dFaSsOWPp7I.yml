description: 'Teams that write code together should be able to debug issues together. But while we think a lot about engineering collaboratively, we rarely develop processes for debugging collaboratively. Often, debugging is the hardest part of the job. What does an engineer do when the logs have expired, she can’t reproduce the issue, and she''s tested five different hypotheses? I’ll talk about a workflow that allows teams to collaboratively debug issues without repeating work or losing progress and why it makes sense.'
