title: 'Building the Business Case for App Modernization'
language: English
recordingDate: 1601026939
description: "Development teams—who would love to spend a couple sprints paying down technical debt—often seem to be at odds with business stakeholders who want new features, like, yesterday. Convincing “the business” that modernization and refactoring are worthy investments of time feels like trying to convince a teenager they should save for retirement instead of buying their first car. \n\nIn this talk, I’ll lay out the building blocks to making a business case for modernization. Using examples and learnings from teams that have taken on refactoring work, I’ll arm you with qualitative proof points as well as quantitative models.\n\nDormain Drewitz, Director at VMware\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/building-the-business-case-for-app-modernization-238434240"
