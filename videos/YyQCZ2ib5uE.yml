title: 'Can you keep it a secret? - Lars Kristian Hagen'
recordingDate: 1499244330
description: "“Of course we can keep it a secret!”, you say. “Challenge accepted”, says the hacker!\n\nThere are more secrets to be kept than the login credentials of your users. User authentication is a problem you can solve this by using authentication providers or frameworks.\n\nIt is easy to forget that we often handle other secrets as well. These may be just as critical, or even more so: What about cryptographic keys, signing keys, credentials to third party systems both for the system itself and/or mapped to each of your users? If these secrets ever get revealed, the damage to the reputation of your company, client or yourself could be enormous. Not to mention potentially having to compensate for damages as well.\n\nThis talk discusses how one can securely store secrets using extremely secure cloud based storage solutions specialized for secrets. What are the use cases and how to integrate with your application. The topics covered are based on the research and experience gained during the implementation of my current project."
