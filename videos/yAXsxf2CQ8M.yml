description: "PyData DC 2018\n\nSkorch is a scikit-learn compatible neural network library that wraps PyTorch. skorch reduces the boilerplate needed to train a neutral network by abstracting away the training loop and providing a callback API for common tasks such as recording metrics. This talk is targeted to users familiar with the scikit-learn API and have had some exposure to neutral networks.\n\nSlides - https://github.com/thomasjpfan/pydata2018_dc_skorch/raw/master/slides.pdf\n\nRepo with slides and code - https://github.com/thomasjpfan/pydata2018_dc_skorch\n===\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
