description: "From OSCON 2015 in Portland: The early days of the open source movement were all about creating an approachable on-ramp to software freedom. We focused strongly on the practical benefits of free software and refined the message, hoping to help the professional software sector better understand what we’d been saying since 1983. We succeeded to such an extent that modern open source is characterized by active use, participation, and contributions, from the largest Fortune 50 software giants to the smallest Silicon Valley startups and everything in between. Success in our first goal doesn’t mean we’re done, it only means we’re due to clearly define the next phase of open source. The potential of what we might accomplish, using the resources of the entire software industry, is both inspiring and daunting. Will we live up to that potential?\n\nThis keynote sponsored by HP.\n\nAbout Allison Randal:\nAllison Randal is a software developer and open source strategist, currently working on open source strategy at HP.
