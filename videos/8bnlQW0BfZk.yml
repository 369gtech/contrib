description: "The naïve programmer is not “the bad programmer” or so. He is just not so sophisticated. Naïve programmers are everywhere. Almost all programmers wish they could be better.\n\nWhat does it mean to be a sophisticated programmer? To be a real master of your craft? They are versatile and powerful. They draw connections. They work with concepts and ideas (sometimes coming from other fields) to think about and to explain the problems they have to solve.\n\nEVENT:\n\nDjangoCon 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nDaniele Procida\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo21oPhfhFg&t=73s"
