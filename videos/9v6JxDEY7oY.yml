description: "Panel: Continuous Security: Inject Pipelines With Critical Protection for Your Apps - Kamala Dasika, Pivotal, James Wickett, Signal Sciences, Simon Maple, Snyk, & Josh Kirkwood, CyberArk\n\nAs development teams continue to automate processes and speed up their application delivery, implementing security controls at scale to support this velocity has become a challenge for enterprises. Developers are increasingly using prebuilt open source or third-party container images, applications are being subjected to new types of attacks, and production environments need to be updated against a relentless pace of newly announced vulnerabilities.\n\nSo, how do security teams re-orient their processes to safely keep pace? How will you ensure the right privileges and access to secrets across apps? In this session, a panel of security experts will discuss best practices on how enterprises can ensure the security of their containerized applications throughout their lifecycle without negatively impacting frontline productivity.\n\nParticipants include Simon Maple, DevOps Security Lead at Snyk; Josh Kirkwood, DevOps security lead at CyberArk; and James Wickett, Head of Research at Signal Sciences. The discussion will be lead by Kamala Dasika from Pivotal Software while working in references to baking bread and CISO humor.\n\nhttps://cfseu18.sched.com/event/FRyz/panel-continuous-security-inject-pipelines-with-critical-protection-for-your-apps-kamala-dasika-pivotal-james-wickett-signal-sciences-simon-maple-snyk-josh-kirkwood-cyberark"
