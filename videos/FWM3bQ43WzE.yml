description: "Erlang Factory SF Bay Area 2013\nMore info and slides on the website: http://www.erlang-factory.com/conference/SFBay2013/talks\n\nErlang Services Platform (Erlang/SP) is a library that is fully integrated and compliant with existing OTP libraries, but attempts to enable Dataflow Programming techniques. The library anticipates future chips with 100s - 10Ks of cores, allowing problems to be solved by organizing Cooperating Processes (co-ops) around Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) as an augmentation to traditional gen_* system architectures."
