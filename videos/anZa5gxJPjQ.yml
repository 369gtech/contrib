It is also particularly suited for handling time-evolving date.\nVowpal Wabbit has become quite popular: it is a handy, light and efficient command line tool allowing to do online learning on GB of data, even on a standard laptop with standard memory. After a brief reminder of the online learning principles, we present how to run Vowpal Wabbit on Hadoop in a distributed fashion."
