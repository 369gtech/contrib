description: "PyData Berlin 2018\n\nNot only do you have to master computer systems and statistical models, but you also need to report on your results as well as win the hearts and minds of the decision makers â€“ the life of a data scientist ain't easy! But how do you make them understand? Surely, you cannot teach them matrix calculus and functional analysis in an afternoon. Take my hand and I walk you through the basics.\n---\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
