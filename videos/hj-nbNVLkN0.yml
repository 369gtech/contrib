title: 'I wanna be a Key Player - Niklas Hansson'
recordingDate: 1414152570
description: "Key players are the players that make up the “spine” of the team and allows the team to become a platform for other players to excel from.\nManagement articles and classes regularly discuss this and the importance of mixing roles and personalities in a team. Meanwhile, it is rather unusual for vocational classes and articles to enter this subject in depth. By analyzing and reflecting of your roles in your daily team situations, you can find opportunities to contribute more to the team and show off yourself as a key player.\n\nIn this session we’ll look into different team situations from inside the team and discuss how we can adapt ourselves to boost the team by making an active choice of which role to take and emphasizing (or understating) personality traits."
