description: "Perl6 books are all about the language. Catch is that actually writing and submitting a module requires a bit more than that: Sane ways to lay out the module, command-line tools for testing and bundling the result. This talk tries to jump-start the process for people who want to try out Perl6 by showing how to get the framework, well... working.\n\nHow many people walking in the door really know how to use zef, mi6, or anything else Perl6-ish? \nUntil we do, Perl6 will be an orphan."
