description: "Yes, thereâ€™s normal forms beyond third, and yes they can be really useful! Anchor Modelling is a fantastic database modelling paradigm that uses sixth normal form (6NF) to store data and provides third normal form (3NF) views for ease of use.\n\nThis session deep dives into all the concepts behind Anchor Modelling (and indeed databases generally!) and then takes you through how Anchor Modelling uses these concepts to move away from the traditional data warehouse paradigm to deliver a purely additive, agile database."
