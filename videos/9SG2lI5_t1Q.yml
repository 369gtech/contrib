title: '[VDZ19] Frontend Monoliths: Run if you can! by Jonas Bandi and Daniel Wiehl'
language: English
recordingDate: 1553603585
description: "The frontend monoliths are here! They arrived with the trend to build modern single page applications. Frameworks like Angular and React boosted the growth of these monoliths. While we were cultivating micro-services in the backend, a new generation of monoliths conquered the frontend. Nobody saw them coming, but they are here now and we don't know how to get rid of them.\n\nThe talk shows how frontend monoliths are characterized and how they come into existence. We are looking at different approaches on how to get rid of frontend monoliths, even though there is no \"silver bullet\" or single \"best practice\" yet. We will have a look at different forms of the mythical \"Micro-Frontend\".\n\nWe will introduce the SCION Workbench Application Platform which is an open source project based on Angular and provides the mechanics for client-side web application integration. Any web application can be integrated. If the site does not interact with the platform, there is no need for adaptation. For a deeper integration, the platform provides a framework-agnostic guest API allowing interaction with the platform and other applications."
