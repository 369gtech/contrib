title: 'Legacy Code and Golden Master: How to refactor code more easily'
language: English
recordingDate: 1603203584
description: "In today's workshop, Sebastian Kulinski, Software Craftsman at Codurance, explains how to work with Legacy Code and the Golden Master Technique, which allows us to save a copy of the output a program generates, so we can refactor safely,  and make optimise testing code. We will follow Sebastian on a live kata to better understand this process. \n\nIt is really important to know how to work with Legacy Code, the one that has been previously written and very often we face trouble trying to understand. Due to the constant evolution of practices and software development, knowing when to maintain or to change it becomes essential. Rewriting can end up meaning loss of functionality and productivity, and can be a long and difficult process.\n\nBy refactoring with Golden Master, we change the structure of the code instead of changing its functionality, making it more understandable and efficient to work with.\n\nThank you Sebastian for a very interesting webinar!\n\nFor more information about Codurance, please visit our website: https://codurance.com/."
