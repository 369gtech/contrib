description: "MySQL 8.0 Document Store: How to Mix NoSQL & SQL in MySQL 8.0 a database where developers and DBAs live in peace\nby Frédéric Descamps\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/UA2.118/mysql8documentstore.webm\n\n\nMySQL 8.0 is now also a Document Store where it's very easy to store JSON documents and use CRUD operations. Developers now can deal with their datata without writing a single line of SQL. In this talk, I will show how easy it's for developers to use CRUD operations that allow a cleaner and easier development but also how the DBA can deal with the data and benefits from the power of a RDBMS. \n\nI will illustrate this with examples where we add data/modify data very easily and where we increase the speed of the queries in the background and generate more complicated reports using SQL on the same data. \n\nThe best of both worlds in one single product. \n\nRoom: UA2.118 (Henriot)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 18:40:00+01"
