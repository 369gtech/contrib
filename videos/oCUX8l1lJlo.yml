language: English
recordingDate: 1618347540
description: "For the last 15 years, there’s been an enterprise Linux distro that has helped to keep users secure from zero day defects such as Heartbleed, Meltdown and Spectre, as well as introducing innovations like KSplice. Now it’s back in the spotlight thanks to controversy around IBM's decision to declare end of life for CentOS.\n\nAlexa Weber Morales, Oracle director of developer content, talks to Bob Shimp, Vice President for Oracle Linux and Virtualization Engineering product management to learn more. You'll also see the switch-from-CentOS-to-Oracle-Linux script in action!"
