description: "This talk will introduce Traefik the open source reverse-proxy/load-balancer which can be used as an Ingress Controller in your container infrastructure. Traefik can interface to backends such as Kubernetes, Docker, Mesos, Consul allowing to dynamically update the routing configuration without service loss.\n\nWe will look at what is a reverse-proxy, an Ingress Controller and Traefik, a state of the art reverse-proxy. We will dig even deeper and show how we made Traefik distributed, scalable and fault tolerant.\n\nDemonstration of the use of Traefik as scalable Ingress Controller on Kubernetes.\n\nDamien Duportal \nFrom @containous\nTr√¶fik's Developer Advocate @ Containous && Freelancer. Former Training Engineer @ CloudBees. Docker mentor. Human stack focused. Rock climber. Passionated. Talk to me !"
