description: "Weâ€™re happy to announce the Generally Available (GA) release of PowerShell 7.0! Steve Lee and Richard Lander discuss how the PowerShell and .NET Teams are working more closely together bringing better compatibility and performance.\n\nPowerShell 7 is the latest major update to PowerShell, a cross-platform (Windows, Linux, and macOS) automation tool and configuration framework optimized for dealing with structured data (e.g. JSON, CSV, XML, etc.), REST APIs, and object models."
