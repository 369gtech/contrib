title: 'Java Interprocess Communication Challenges in Low-Latency Deployments'

recordingDate: 1433519053
description: "The latest SPEC Java middleware benchmark, SPECjbb2013, was architected to exercise interprocess communication and measure response time in the range of less than 10 milliseconds. SPECjbb2013 has been implemented with a wide range of configuration parameters so that various transports of communications and different amounts of data transfer can be simulated. The benchmark can be deployed in a large clustering mode as well as with a varying amount of interprocess communication. This session presents many interesting lessons learned, from which  Java users and application architects can benefit.\n\n\nAuthors:\nAnil Kumar Tatikonda\nundefined\nView more trainings by Anil Kumar Tatikonda at https://www.parleys.com/author/anil-kumar-tatikonda\n\nDaryl Maier\nNo bio available\nView more trainings by Daryl Maier at https://www.parleys.com/author/daryl-maier\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
