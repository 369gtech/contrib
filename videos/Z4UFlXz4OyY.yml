From 'a cherry on top' to a household name valued by nearly everyone. The teams and budgets are getting bigger and bigger, but with all this power comes responsibility â€“ weâ€™re expected to deliver more, at a higher level of quality andâ€¦ faster. Scalability of the design process became a requirement.\n\nTo answer this challenge companies all over the world started to invest into design systems. Unfortunately the problems of scale did not magically disappear. Design systems, deeply rooted into the coded foundation of digital products, lacked any natural and automatic connection to a vast majority of design tools. Why? Majority of design tools operate on the level of vector graphics and hence cannot in any way understand production code and connect to it. - Captured Live on Ustream at https://www.ustream.tv/amuse"
