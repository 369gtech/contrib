description: "How to Start a Solo Project that You'll Stick With by Harrison Bachrach\n\nHave you ever started a solo project that never really came together? Been able to write something up in a weekend but dropped it soon after? Me too! In this talk I go over how I was able to break from that and build my first CLI tool, written in Rust. Drawing from an understanding of habit formation, weâ€™ll examine how to plan projects in a way that keeps you fulfilled and stops you from veering off track."
