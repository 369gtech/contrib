description: "Speaker: Tony Bui\n\nBuilding an online business starts with understanding behavior of users on the website. Google Tag Manager & Google Analytics combined are great tools to achieve that goal and improve the website’s conversion.\n\nIn this topic I’d like to share hard lessons learned with Google Tag Manager and what things newbies like myself can avoid. I will be sharing my experiences as a non-tech guy.\n\nAbout the speaker:\n\nTony Bui is 30 years old, married, and with a daughter. He was born in Hanoi, Vietnam, grew up and lived in Moscow, Russia for 16 years. Now, he has returned back to Vietnam and travels from time to time. He is addicted to traction, and uses Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager for now.\n\nEvent Page: https://2016.singapore.wordcamp.org/\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/VfF8/"
