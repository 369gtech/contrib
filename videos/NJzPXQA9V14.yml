title: 'YOW! Lambda Jam 2013 - Kornelis Sietsma - Promoting Functional Programming in the Enterprise'
recordingDate: 1382309595
description: "Many people recognise the value of Functional Programming, but there are always barriers to getting it adopted in the workplace. In this talk I will cover the approach we took to introduce functional programming at a financial services company.\n\nWe ran a 3 week exercise, developing a small part of our business requirements in parallel in Scala, Clojure and Java. I will discuss our methodology, our results (both objective and subjective), and the eventual outcome.\n\nParts of this exercise worked very well, and parts worked rather less well - I'll also talk about what can be learned from our mistakes, and how others might try to vary our approach in their workplace.\n\nFor more on YOW!
