description: "Google I/O 2010 -  Google Wave Media APIs: Attachments can surf too! \r\n\r\nWave 201 \r\n\r\nSeth Covitz, Jimin Li, Phil Liao \r\n\r\nGoogle Wave is used by diverse groups to communicate and collaborate on projects from work to school to plain old having fun. To make users even more productive, we are providing capabilities that enable them to collaborate on and around any piece of third-party content (e.g. attachments). In this session, we will introduce the Wave Media APIs which enable robots and gadgets to create, access, and modify third-party content in Wave. \r\n\r\nFor all I/O 2010 sessions, please go to http://code.google.com/events/io/2010/sessions.html"
