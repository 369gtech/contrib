description: "This video was recorded at Scala Days Chicago 2017\nFollow us on Twitter @ScalaDays or visit our website for more information http://scaladays.org \n\nAbstract: \nReftree is a Scala library for producing pretty diagrams and animations of data structures (http://stanch.github.io/reftree/demo). It can be used for documentation, live coding or as an interactive tool for understanding how stuff works.\n\nThis talk showcases Reftree and explores how functional programming techniques such as lenses and zippers can be used to implement visualizations of themselves."
