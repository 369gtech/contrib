description: "Google I/O 2009 - How Do I Code Thee? Let Me Count the Ways\r\n\r\nDan Morrill\r\n\r\nThe primary way to develop apps for Android is using managed code that runs in the Dalvik virtual machine. Yet, Android also includes a super-modern Browser that includes Gears. It's even possible to build parts of your apps in native code (that is, C.) Choice is good, but it does mean one more decision for the developer to make -- and in this case, a big decision. Should you write your app in managed code, to integrate cleanly and seamlessly with the system? Should you write your app in the Browser as \"Ajax plus\", so that it can run on multiple phone platforms? Or should you go for raw speed, and write part of it in ARM-processor native code? There's no universal answer to these questions, but in this session Dan Morrill will teach you to pick the technique that works best for your app. In this session, you'll get a demonstration of each technique, and learn how to apply them to your own apps.\r\n\r\nFor presentation slides and all I/O sessions, please go to: code.google.com/events/io/sessions.html"
