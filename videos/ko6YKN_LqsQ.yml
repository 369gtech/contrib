description: "by Pierre-Marie de Rodat\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/AW1.125/ada_toml.webm\n\nThe world of generic structured data formats is full of contenders:\nthe mighty XML, the swift JSON, the awesome YAML, ...  Alas, there\nis no silver bullet: XML is very verbose, JSON is not convenient for\nhumans to write, YAML is known to be hard to parse, and so on.\n\n\nTOML is yet another format whose goal is to be a good configuration\nlanguage: obvious semantics, convenient to write and easy to parse\nin general-purpose programming languages.\n\n\nIn this talk, I'll shortly describe the TOML format and show a few\nuse cases in the real world.  I'll then present the ada-toml library\nitself: its high-level architecture and examples.\n\nRoom: AW1.125\nScheduled start: 2020-02-01 17:30:00"
