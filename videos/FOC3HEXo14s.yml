description: "Check out my courses!\nhttps://developedbyed.com/\n\nLet's talk a bit about my thought process of when and how I write code.  I wanted to talk today a bit about the job market, how I learned to code and why I don't want to do it anymore (kinda).\n\nTeaching stuff that I am passionate about has been extremely fun for me even before I started a youtube channel. \n\nüéÅSupport me on Patreon for exclusive episodes, discord and more!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/dev_ed\n\nüõ¥ Follow me on:\nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/developedbyed\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/developedbyed\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/developedbyed/\nGithub: https://github.com/developedbyed/\n\n#programming"
