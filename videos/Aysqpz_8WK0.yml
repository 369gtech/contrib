description: "Speaker(s):\nDaniel Belcher, Toby Smith\n\nDescription:\nDo you run applications in the cloud? How well do you understand what they're doing? Is Redis overheating? Are all of your Hadoop nodes healthy? Did you notice that spike in errors that you were serving at 3am? Because your users sure did. Luckily, we can help. We'll show you how you can use Google Cloud Platform's powerful logging, monitoring, and alerting capabilities to quickly recognize when your applications aren't behaving or performing well. It's easy to set up, and it's easy to use. We'll demonstrate the integration of Stackdriver's monitoring and alerting system with the Google Cloud Platform. When you leave this talk, you'll understand how you can start using our intelligent monitoring, which lets you spend less time on ops and more time developing the next great cloud app!\n\nWatch all Google I/O 2014 videos at: g.co/io14videos"
