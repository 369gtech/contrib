description: "Microservices promise a scalable architecture, increased flexibility, and better performance. But then you find out what’s actually involved in designing and running a microservices-based architecture. Turns out it’s not that straightforward after all.\n\nOften the discussion around microservices is framed by a false dichotomy between the messy monolith and the lean and mean microservices architecture. Fortunately, there’s a third way: the modularized application. Functional decomposition doesn’t imply that every component has to become its own independent process.\n\nModularization is about strong encapsulation, well-defined interfaces, and explicit dependencies. Many languages offer in-process modularization features (for example, Java with its all-new module system). In this session we explore the right (and wrong) reasons for going with a microservices architecture, as well as what a modularized application entails. There’s a place for both independently deployed microservices and larger applications with a strong internal modular structure. Choose wisely."
