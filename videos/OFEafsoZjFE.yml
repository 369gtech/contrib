recordingDate: 1515768184
description: "There is a lot of tools to build the continuous delivery solution. Most of them are universal, some are platform / technology specific. Serhiy has been building and supporting various CD solutions for .NET web applications for the last few years. For a number of reasons different tools, products and approaches were used. It was a good experience that Serhiy would like to share with you.\n\nIn this talk we will review different options for code review, CI, versioning and deployment. Weâ€™ll discuss pros and cons of each, take a look at corner cases and non-obvious features. And finally we will try to choose an ideal (or close to it) set for .NET applications."
