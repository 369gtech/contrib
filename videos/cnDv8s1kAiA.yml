description: "Java comes with a plethora of new and modern language additions. The adagium \"it is in the language, so it must be good to use it\" stood the test of time, well most of the time. In this talk we discuss some modern and dangerous bad practices that may sneak into your team's codebase that you should definitely be aware of.\n\nNick Vanderhoven has a master in computer science engineering, +10 years of professional experience, crossed the biggest financial and governemental institutions and is course manager and lead architect at jforce (innovating payment solutions).\n\nHe is the senior software engineer that you want in your team. When you confront him with a complex problem, he's able to explain the solution with amazing lucidity, giving you the feeling that the problem had always been really simple and transparent. That's what you want: someone that takes the huge load of experience and brings it to you in a comprehensible way.\n\nJeroen Horemans is a Java/RockStar with a fabulous t-shirt-taste. The IT scene is like a forest filled with mushrooms and most of them are poisonous, but not Jeroen. He's the Java Champion you want in your team, the craftsman you can rely on and the skilled Ninja you want your project to be rescued by,â€¦ and on a bad hair day he puts the sexy in dyslexia.\n\n[SZY-5767]"
