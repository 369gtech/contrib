description: 'It is a widespread conception that QA resources in the team are a necessity and vast majority of projects place them in their teams – both functional and automation testers. I’ll try to debunk this by presenting examples of two successful projects of different size, domain and using different methodologies that succeeded without having a single tester on the team. Finally, we will discuss a few hypotheses attempting to explain why QA presence is so prevalent and what we could learn of it.'
