description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nMaking Compliance Cloud Native - Ann Wallace & Zeal Somani, Google \n\nIf you’re in a highly-regulated industry, you likely have compliance requirements which make it challenging to adopt containers. Traditional compliance frameworks such as PCI and ISO 27001 were written for traditional architectures and have not yet adapted to cloud-native technologies.  We’ll first discuss misconceptions that auditors believe about cloud-native technologies and architectures. Then, we will demonstrate how to meet compliance requirements – like segmentation, encryption, supply chain management, and monitoring – in a containerized environment, using our OSS K8S compliance starter kit. Lastly, we will share techniques for communicating these learnings with audit and compliance officers.  Attendees will come away from this talk with knowledge of how technologies like Kubernetes can actually make compliance easier and how to shift left security and compliance requirements.\n\nhttps://sched.co/ZetI"
