description: "Elder Moraes, Cloud Evangelist, Oracle\n\nIf you are a software architect or developer, you’ve surely already faced one of these situations: systems integration, communication between different stacks, data exchange from different sources. What if you could gather all those moving parts into one single environment? There’s a way, and it’s called containers. It not only has been changing the software industry quickly but has also opened the path enabling new platforms to come up. That’s the case with Fn Project, a serverless platform based on containers. This session shows you how this platform can simplify the integration between absolutely different technologies, with both scalability and availability."
