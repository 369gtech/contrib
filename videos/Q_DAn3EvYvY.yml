title: 'Modernizing Large Frontends with Web Components - Sam Julien'
language: English
recordingDate: 1582894450
description: "If you’re an enterprise software developer, you and your team probably struggle to know how or when to migrate their legacy code to current frameworks. Should you burn it all to the ground and start over (who has the time for that?) or let it sit forever, getting more outdated each day? Is there a third way?\n\nWeb Components help bridge that gap between legacy and modern code without having to go to either extreme. By creating custom reusable elements, teams are able to add a layer of indirection between the business logic and view layer of applications. This indirection lets legacy code and shiny, new frameworks work together in harmony.\n\nIn this talk, you’ll learn the current Web Components landscape and how to evaluate whether to use them for large legacy frontend migrations. You’ll also learn how to overcome architectural challenges of large scale refactoring by looking at a common use of Web Components: using Angular Elements to iteratively migrate AngularJS (1.x) to Angular (2+).\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks, courses, and conferences in the following links:\nhttps://ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
