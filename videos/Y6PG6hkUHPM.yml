title: 'Addressing Network Congestion in Riak Clusters - Steve Vinoski'
language: English
recordingDate: 1373615851
description: "Erlang User Conference 2013\nMore info and slides on the website: http://www.erlang-factory.com/conference/ErlangUserConference2013/talks \n\nIn high-scale distributed systems like Riak, an open source distributed database written in Erlang, the network can make or break system reliability and availability. In this talk, Steve will discuss an experimental approach to alleviating network congestion effects such as timeouts and throughput collapse for Riak clusters under extreme load. He will cover the basics of Riak, explain what features of Riak can cause networking problems at scale, and then discuss the results of using a new Erlang network driver to try to address those problems."
