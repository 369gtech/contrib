title: 'Building Delightful User Interfaces (aka Making Design Central To A Development Process)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1541982601
description: "While everyone enjoys delightful interfaces, polishing the user experience is rarely the priority when building new products. Animations are more often than not considered as superfluous, with every interaction effect or visual feedback not strictly required to makes things work considered as low priority. However, a human-centered design process is, in fact, key to a product's success. It contributes to create products people don't only need to use, but want to use, driving up user satisfaction and engagement. In this session, Benjamin will share real-world examples and best practices on how to deliver efficient and enjoyable experiences, build a brand that conveys trust, and make customers happy.\n\nEVENT:\n\nCSS Day 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nBenjamin De Cock\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZpTvZuysIo"
