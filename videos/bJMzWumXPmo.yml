description: "RubyConf 2019 - Investigative Metaprogramming by Betsy Hiabel\n\nWhen was the last time you got an un-Googleable error? The kind that takes you and your lead three days to debug, with weird generic stacktraces deep in framework internals? What if you could approach that bug with something other than trial, error, and tears? Metaprogramming can come to the rescue -- just not the kind you do in production. In this talk, you'll learn strategies for investigative metaprogramming. You'll learn how to insert debugging hooks anywhere and instrument anything. You'll even learn how to turn that information into actionable bugfixes.\n\n#confreaks #rubyconf2019"
