description: 'In this talk, Gary Rennie, a Phoenix Core Team Member, looked at the changes in Cowboy 2 and how we can use it with Plug and Phoenix by using a custom Plug adapter. He then looked at how this can be done using a library and integrating it with Plug. The same technique was then applied to Phoenix, writing a custom handler in a library and then using it with Phoenix. He also explored how HTTP/2 can be used to build a new Phoenix Transport, allowing Phoenix PubSub to work with a bidirectional HTTP/2 channel,  investigate how existing transports work, and what changes are required to implement a custom transport.'
