title: 'Badass Microservices â€“ Deploy, Build and Scale Your Apps with Payara Micro by Navin Surtani'
language: English
recordingDate: 1447405729
description: "Building on the Java EE 7 support of its GlassFish 4.1 core Payara Micro is a super-lightweight container for you to deploy your applications from the command line without needing to install a full-blown application server. With its automatic and elastic clustering, it is designed for running Java EE applications in a modern containerized/virtualized infrastructure. As each Payara Micro server will automatically cluster with other servers on the network your Java EE application can be elastically scaled horizontally by adding and removing containers based on demand.\n\nIn this talk, Navin Surtani and Mike Croft will demonstrate the ease of deployment of applications and services to Payara Micro, along with showing how simple it is to build and scale a cluster of instances running these services."
