description: "This talk will focus on the need for, process of, and impact of developing custom software and data systems for scientists. My aim is to give you a glimpse into the rewarding world of software in science by drawing from concrete examples in own my experience of building systems using Perl, Python, JavaScript, Elm, and many other languages. For over three years now I've been the staff programmer in a biology research lab at the University of Washington, and I'll share what I've learned along the way after making the jump from commercial software development.\n\nInterested in learning more about software in science? This talk is for you!\n\nDo startups excite you? A science research lab has more in common with a startup than you might think!\n\nEnjoy learning new domain knowledge to get your job done? Biology is fascinating and amazing!\n\n\nIâ€™m a software developer in a University of Washington microbiology lab despite my Geology degree. I still like rocks though and not just in my Old Fashioned."
