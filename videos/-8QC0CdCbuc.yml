title: 'DEF CON Safe Mode Blue Team Village -Jake Smith & Jack McDowell - Building BLUESPAWN'
language: English
recordingDate: 1597879048
description: 'Our team has developed BLUESPAWN, a fully open-source, active defense and EDR tool for Windows. While there are ample offensive oriented tools publicly available, there is very little on the defensive side. We aim to use this project to demonstrate how modern-day security solutions work by building our own from the ground up. In addition, we integrate a number of popular community libraries and tools such as MITRE ATT&CK, DoD STIGs, YARA, and PE-Sieve with one goal: to enable any security analyst to quickly detect, identify, and eliminate malicious activity on a system.'
