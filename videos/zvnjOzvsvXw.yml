title: 'Eduardo Blancas - Rethinking Software Testing for Data Science| PyData Global 2020'
language: English
recordingDate: 1609866593
description: "Talk \nEnsuring that data pipelines are reproducible at all times is primordial to trust our results. Drawing inspiration from software engineering, this talk describes a practical framework to make continuous testing feasible by tackling the four challenges that data-intensive software posits: effective test cases, structure, speed and upstream data changes.\n\nSpeaker\nHi, this is Eduardo. I am broadly interested in developing tools that helps us deliver reliable data products. Towards that end, I developed Ploomber, an open-source Python library. I hold an M.S in Data Science from Columbia University, where I conducted research in computational neuroscience. I started my Data Science career in 2015 when I joined the Center for Data Science and Public Policy at The University of Chicago.\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
