description: 'Here is a story of how I did my due diligence as an ARMY through data visualization. As long as you have an idea about what you want to show, you can use JavaScript to collect and visualize data! I will share with you the process of data visualization, from selecting the main subjects and key indices for storytelling, to choosing the right type of visualization charts. It''s easy to create one chart, but how could you tell it''s a good chart? I''ll share some tips to answer this question as well. I''m thrilled to share what I learned with you, because learning and growing is way more fun together than alone!'
