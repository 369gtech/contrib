title: 'Rummaging in the clOOset - Curtis “Ovid” Poe'
language: English
recordingDate: 1623341094
description: "With all of the talk about bringing modern-OO to the Perl core, you might wonder what \"modern\" is.\n\nThis is not an easy thing to answer, but we'll talk about the history of OO, ways to think about OO today, why Dr. Alan Kay is brilliant, and explore OO in other languages.\n\nObject-oriented programming is, sadly, something that is widely misunderstood. When done well, it's brilliant. When done poorly, it leads to rants by developers about why OO is useless and we should all use [insert favorite paradigm here] programming.\n\nSadly, this talk won't be covering much about doing OO well for the simple reason that there's too much to cover and I have to cut _something_. But we'll hit some of the high points. What we _plan_ to cover is:\n\n* A Brief History of OO\n* Why Dr. Alan Kay hates us all\n* How OO is used today\n* How other languages approach OO\n\nExamples for Perl will often use [Corinna](https://github.com/Ovid/Cor/wiki) syntax, while examples from other languages are often NSFW and may cause gastrointestinal distress. At a minimum, for comparisons, we'll touch on Ruby, BETA, Python, and maybe Java. All of these languages have interesting features that are worth considering.\n\n(And you in the back, shut up about Eiffel already; I only have 50 minutes)"
