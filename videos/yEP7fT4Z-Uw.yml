language: English
recordingDate: 1598238106
description: "The objective of the talk is to give an overview of the latest development in OpenSky Network – recording Air Traffic Control ATC voice communications.\n\nAs the receiver-feeder system will be developed within ATCO2 project, an undertaking financed by the European Union, a short overview of the ATCO2 project will be given. The central question covered in this first part of the talk is: “What will happen with the voice recording after it’s uploaded to OpenSky Network?”\n\nThe main part of the talk will focus on how to set up the receiver which is built around RTLSDR-Airband - an open source multichannel AM/NFM receiver (more about it here: https://github.com/szpajder/RTLSDR-Airband/wiki).\n\nParticipants are encouraged to take an active role during the workshop and set up the receiver during the talk. In order to do that, listeners should make sure they have the following items available:\n- Raspberry Pi (any version should work).\n- SDR-RTL dongle (RTL-SDR Blog R820T2 RTL2832U 1PPM TCXO SMA Software Defined Radio with Dipole Antenna Kit available from https://www.rtl-sdr.com/buy-rtl-sdr-dvb-t-dongles/ as includes antenna and antenna cables).\n- SD card (with memory of 16GB is sufficient)"
