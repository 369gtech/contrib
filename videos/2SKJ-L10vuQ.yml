description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nDynamic Configuration with ComponentConfig and the Control Loop - Chris Hein, Apple & Leigh Capili, Weaveworks \n\nComponentConfig is a pattern that allows you to use Kubernetes API Machinery to load Configuration files that look and feel like Kubernetes resources. This talk will introduce the idea of combining ComponentConfig with Dynamic Configs through CRDs to allow your controllers to dynamically reconfigure themselves similar to the way the Dynamic Kubelet Configuration works. This pattern can be useful for any Controller or Operator builder to make updating and managing the controller much more straightforward for end-users. This pattern also introduces the ability to report customized status about how the controller is operating, reducing the cognitive load for users to debug misconfigured controllers.\n\nhttps://sched.co/ZemW"
