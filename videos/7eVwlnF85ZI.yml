language: English
recordingDate: 1557993495
description: "GraalVM is a new, universal VM for any programming language and any environment. GraalVM Enterprise is our enterprise product built on GraalVM and Java SE, providing even better performance, lower footprint, and better isolation. It is also designed to be the most flexible runtime, embeddable into any other server or device using any language. GraalVM is being used in a rapidly growing set of frameworks and a number of different business applications.\n\nWeâ€™ll look at how GraalVM Enterprise helps deployments based on microservice or Function-as-a-Service technologies today with our support for polyglot runtimes, isolates, and native images, as well as how we expect GraalVM to evolve to better support cloud use cases in the future."
