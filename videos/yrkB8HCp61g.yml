While the definition of a launch has gotten cloudy in this age of public betas, were looking for new companies or products that make us take notice. And while venture capital has been the focus in past years, the reality of the market is that companies must gain the attention of customers. So our judging panel and criteria this year focus more on what is essential and transformational in todays market than on ability to get funded."
