description: 'Go’s concurrency mechanism is one of the language''s most attractive features. Too much of it can get you in trouble, however. Using nothing but our wits and Go''s standard library, Johnny & Arron will code an increasingly sophisticated network utility to help you learn how best to take advantage of Go’s concurrency capabilities and how to avoid some of its pitfalls. You''ll walk away from this talk with practical skills you can apply to your current and future Go projects.'
