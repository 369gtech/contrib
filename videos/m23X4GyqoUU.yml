recordingDate: 1379941540
description: "A decade has shown that properly implemented Agile delivers improved predictability and quality. It is for most business the first step towards the Agility. Agility is the capability to deliver more value faster, at reduced expense, while flexibly responding to changing demands. Agility requires a systemic lean value driven transformation of both the business and product development organizations.\n\nIn this talk, Dave describes approaches being used by leading companies to increase their Agility. He discusses innovative business and technical practices that in some cases challenge Agile.Old. Business practices discussed include sustainable leadership; capacity/capability portfolio management; projects versus products; smart sourcing; envisioning; fixed price time/cost estimation. Technical practices discussed include:\n\n* example driven design;\n* loosely coupled service architectures;\n* alternative programming models;\n* software by example;\n* code, deploy and monitor;\n* randomized testing\n\nDave Thomas is an expert in dynamic languages and has decades of experience building and deploying language VMs for mobile, instrumentation, embedded command and control, and business application on platforms from mainframes to a microprocessors. He is widely known and respected in the programming language community and this year will be presenting the keynote at the Commercial Users of Functional Programming (CUFP) conference.\n\nWhile CEO of OTI, now IBM OTI Labs, he over saw IBM's Smalltalk and J9 family of Java JVMs, OSGi as well as the initial releases of Eclipse. He lead an IBM OTI research effort into universal virtual machines.  After leaving IBM he worked on JVM support for dynamic languages and the use of V8 for embedded applications.  For the past 6 years Dave has been working with high performance vector functional virtual machines, DSLs and most recently exploring special purpose HW VMs.\n\nFor more on YOW!
