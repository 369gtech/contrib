title: Refactoring your legacy code for better maintainability
language: English
recordingDate: 1461276000
description: 'Though the code is written once, it’s read ten or hundred of times during
  the lifetime of an application. Thus, the way to write code is very important for
  maintainability. However, for various reasons, sometimes developers don’t write
  the most maintainable code: hence, it’s necessary to be able to rewrite this code
  when there’s time. In this live demo, I’ll show you techniques and tools to help
  you refactor in the safest way.'
