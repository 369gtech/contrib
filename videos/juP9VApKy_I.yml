description: "Filmed at https://2017.dotscale.io on April 24th in Paris. More talks on https://dotconferences.com/talks\n\nAdrian talks about often confused telemetry tools: Logging, Metrics and Distributed Tracing. He shows how to capture latency using each of those tools and how they work differently. Through examples and discussion, Adrian notes edge cases where certain tools have advantages over others. By the end of his talk, you will better understand how each of Logging, Metrics and Distributed Tracing aids you in different ways to understand how your applications behave."
