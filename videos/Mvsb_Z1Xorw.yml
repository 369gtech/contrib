description: "Identity data is a commodity these days, and conducting identity theft or synthetic ID operations has never been easier. In this 100% real case study we’ll track the second-by-second operation of cyber criminals attempting to target major card issuers and digital banks. \nWe’ll discuss their behavior, choices and motivations, what makes them so different than honest folks who wish to open an account online, and what next-gen data sources and analysis domains the industry is beginning to leverage against such attacks. It’s time to put up a good fight!"
