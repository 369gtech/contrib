language: English
recordingDate: 1541192404
description: "At a glance, React and Vue are like two peas in a pod. They are lightweight component-based libraries for building user interfaces and can be used fairly interchangeably to build scalable web applications. Though they are noticeably different in terms of syntax, their key differences lie in their respective ways of thinking. As a React developer learning Vue, adapting to the idiomatic way of writing Vue is a challenge that requires a sound understanding of the philosophy behind the framework. In this talk, we will examine the nuances between the two frameworks and cover common mistakes that React developers make when switching from React to Vue.\n\nEVENT:\n\nNode+JS Interactive 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nDivya Sasidharan\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nThe Linux Foundation provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5xF_JHb5oc"
