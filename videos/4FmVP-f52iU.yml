description: 'How hard can responsive web be? It sounds simple: design for a number of screen sizes and just throw in several media queries and your website isnow "responsive"! Unfortunately, this is not the case and responsive web hasn''t made our job easier. Adopting responsive web design will force you to change your design, development, and testing workflow. Problems may also arise in different stages of the workflow. In this talk, we will talk about responsive web blunders at Viki, how we overcome it, and some tips on how you can avoid it.'
