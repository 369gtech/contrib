Maybe something for effective data processing and distributed persistence? You can have it too with Kafka and Hazelcast. Now let’s have a look at how to assemble all together in almost no time, using Payara Micro. You’ll learn how to use a couple of simple tools to build a highly efficient, scalable and robust system that can be evolved continuously to meet rapidly changing needs and increasing loads.\n\nOndro Mihályi From Payara\nOndro is a software developer and consultant specializing in combining standard and proven tools to solve new and challenging problems.
