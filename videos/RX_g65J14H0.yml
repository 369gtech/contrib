description: "Recording brought to you by American Express https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs\nUnit Testing in Kotlin is fun and tricky at the same time. We can benefit a lot from Kotlin's powerful language features to write readable and concise unit tests. But in order to write idiomatic Kotlin test code in the first place, there is a certain test setup required. We'll talk about test lifecycles, mocking challenges, proper assertion libraries, the power of data classes and about spring integration. This talk contains best practices and guidelines to write unit test code in Kotlin that is idiomatic, readable, concise and produces reasonable failure messages.\n\nAbout the Presenter:\nPhilipp Hauer works as a team lead for Spreadshirt in Leipzig, Germany. He focuses on developing JVM-based web applications and is enthusiastic about Kotlin, clean code, architectures and the sociology of software development. Moreover, Philipp is a keen blogger and tweets from time to time."
