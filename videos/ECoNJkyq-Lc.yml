title: 'YOW! 2014 Christopher Hunt - Introducing Reactive Streams'
recordingDate: 1514468212
description: "Reactive Streams is an initiative to provide a standard for asynchronous stream processing with non-blocking back pressure on the JVM.\n\nHandling streams of data—especially “live” data whose volume is not predetermined—requires special care in an asynchronous system. The most prominent issue is that resource consumption needs to be carefully controlled such that a fast data source does not overwhelm the stream destination. Asynchrony is needed in order to enable the parallel use of computing resources, on collaborating network hosts or multiple CPU cores within a single machine\n\nThis presentation will use the new akka-streams project and Scala to demonstrate how streams with back pressure can be managed.\n\nChristopher is a senior engineer at Typesafe and a member of the Play framework team. His most recent contribution for Play has been sbt-web; a technology that brings web development concerns to sbt. Christopher is now also involved in the active application of akka-streams, akka-http and akka-cluster. Prior to Typesafe Christopher worked in R&D at the SpringSource division of VMware, now known as Pivotal. Christopher brings 30 years of development experience to Typesafe.\n\nChristopher lives in Australia just south of Sydney.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
