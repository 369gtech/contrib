In this talk we will give you an introduction to deep learning from a practical point of view.\n\nWe will show you how to run your model on a neural compute stick and give you an insight into what possible pitfalls you might encountr when building your own deep learning solution. By comparing the different frameworks and languages that support deep learning weâ€™ll try to guide you in determining what framework best suits your needs. We will learn how you can leverage the predictive power of existing models such as VGGNet, ResNet, Inception, ..."
