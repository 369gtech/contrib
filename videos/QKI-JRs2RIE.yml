description: "10 Ways to Shoot Yourself in the Foot with Kubernetes, #9 Will Surprise You - Laurent Bernaille & Robert Boll, Datadog \n\nKubernetes is a very powerful and complicated system, and many users don’t understand the underlying systems. Come learn how your users can abuse container runtimes, overwhelm your control plane, and cause outages - it’s actually quite easy!    In the last year, we have containerized hundreds of applications and deployed them in large scale clusters (more than 1000 nodes). The journey was eventful and we learned a lot along the way. We’ll share stories of our ten favorite Kubernetes foot guns, including the dangers of cargo culting, rolling updates gone wrong, the pitfalls of initContainers, and nightmarish daemonset upgrades. The talk will present solutions we adopted to avoid or work around some these problems and will finally show several improvements we plan deploy in the future. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPYL"
