description: "Smelling Smoke? How to Design a Disaster Recovery Strategy for Cloud Foundry - George Lestaris & Chunyi Lyu, Pivotal\n\nCloud Foundry is a platform that can run on any IaaS. It is a distributed system composed mostly of stateless components, in true cloud-native fashion, but state has to, eventually, live somewhere. Disaster recovery (DR) is usually a non-functional operational readiness requirement but it is not always well-understood. Platform Engineers need to have a trusted DR plan as itâ€™s crucial to both their business continuity strategy and to the developers of the platform.\n\nThis talk is split into two sections. The first part will be about the theory of DR for distributed systems and how this theory applies to Cloud Foundry. DR comes with a set of tradeoffs that platform engineers need to incorporate into their platform architecture. In the second part, Chunyi and George will be talking about BOSH Backup a Restore (BBR). A tool that can be part of a DR plan when Cloud Foundry is deployed using BOSH. They will discuss patterns of multi-site setups and the tradeoffs platform engineers can make in order to minimise the impact of backups.\n\nAbout Chunyi Lyu\nChunyi Lyu is a software engineer at Pivotal working on the Platform Recovery(BBR) team. She has extensive experience on the open source Cloud Foundry and BOSH, and has previously spoken at CF summit 2018.\n\nAbout George Lestaris\nGeorge Lestaris is the product manager for the Cloud Foundry BBR team, working at Pivotal in London. Prior to this, he led the CFCR and GrootFS projects. Before Pivotal, George spent time with high throughput computing and cloud computing research. He has given talks before in CF Summit NA 2016 and EU 2017, ContainerCamp LDN 2016, Open Source Summit Japan 2017 and Prague 2017.\n\nhttps://www.cloudfoundry.org/"
