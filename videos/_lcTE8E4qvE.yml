description: "Driven by a desire for faster short-request processing and for near real-time responses to critical business events and made increasingly practical by commodity pricing of machines with terabytes of RAM and software to use it we are witnessing an industry wide shift to in-memory data management. In this session I will take you through the evolving landscape of In-Memory Data Grids, In-Memory Data Bases and CEP Engines. Key concepts and metrics will be introduced to equip you with a toolkit for applying in-memory data management. I will also cover emerging standards and make some predictions about the future.\n\nGreg founded Ehcache in 2003.
