description: "Spring I/O 2017 - 18 -19 May, Barcelona\n\nSlides: https://speakerdeck.com/sdeleuze/functional-web-applications-with-spring-and-kotlin\n\nIn this brand new talk, I will show how you can leverage Kotlin and Spring Framework 5 to build functional web applications efficiently.\n\nI will describe gradually how you can transform your Spring Boot 1.0 Java project into a Spring Boot 2.0 Kotlin project running on top of the new WebFlux functional web framework:\n- Step 1: Use Kotlin instead of Java 8\n- Step 2: Upgrade to Spring Framework 5 and Spring Boot 2.0\n- Step 3: Switch from Spring MVC to WebFlux and Reactive APIs\n- Step 4: Use WebFlux functional API\n\nThis talk will detail the upcoming official Kotlin support introduced in Spring Framework 5 [1], and will also demonstrate a real Spring + Kotlin functional web application [2] that I built for the last 6 months for MiXiT conference.\n\n[1] https://spring.io/blog/2017/01/04/introducing-kotlin-support-in-spring-framework-5-0\n[2] https://github.com/mixitconf/mixit"
