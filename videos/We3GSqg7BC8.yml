title: 'YOW! Conference 2018 - Casey Rosenthal - Deprecating Simplicity'
recordingDate: 1551304801
description: "Deprecating Simplicity\n\nWhen engineering teams take on a new project, they often optimize for performance, availability, or fault tolerance. More experienced teams can optimize for these properties simultaneously. Now add an additional property: feature velocity. Mental models of architecture can help you understand the tension between these engineering properties. For example, understanding the distinction between accidental complexity and essential complexity can help you decide whether to invest engineering effort into simplifying your stack or expanding the surface area of functional output. Chaos Engineering was born within this conflict between feature velocity and increasing complexity. Rather than simplify, Chaos Engineering provides a mechanism for you to embrace the complexity and ride it like a familiar wave, maintaining our business priorities while dialing up feature velocity.\n\nCasey Rosenthal is CTO at Backplane. Previously, he was an executive manager and senior architect, where he managed teams tackling big data, architected solutions to difficult problems, and trained others to do the same. He seeks opportunities to leverage his experience with distributed systems, artificial intelligence, translating novel algorithms and academia into working models, and selling a vision of the possible to clients and colleagues alike. For fun, Casey models human behavior using personality profiles in Ruby, Erlang, Elixir, Prolog, and Scala.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
