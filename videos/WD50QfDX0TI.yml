description: "Talk recording from Amsterdam JSNation 2018 Conference https://amsterdamjs.com\n\nconsole.log(brain)\n\nWhat if you could log your brain to the developer console, typing with your brain signals? This talk is a demonstration of an open-source Brain-Computer Interface that is completely developed with JavaScript, from the ground up, using neural networks and signal processing. Armagan hits the stage with a wireless EEG headset, shows how to read signals from the brain in JavaScript using native C++ Node.js modules over USB, and the implementation in Electron, Node.js and Vue.js."
