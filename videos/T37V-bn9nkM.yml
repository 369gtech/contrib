description: "Computers are getting smaller and smaller and cheaper and cheaper. It’s possible to sock computers away almost anywhere, and to connect almost anything to the internet. This talk will explore the limits of embeddable hardware and present a getting-started-guide to the internet of things, using a pcDuino, WebSphere Liberty, and Bluemix as a case study. What’s needed? How much does it cost? What’s the best way of making an embeddable device talk to the internet, and turning data into an application?\n\nAs well as hints and tips, there will be a show-and-tell session (or “demo” if you’re discussing with your boss)."
