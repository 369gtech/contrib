language: English
recordingDate: 1634144427
description: "In today's GUI challenge I share my thinking on a way to enable users to multi-select. To demonstrate multi-select I've prepared a filterable grid which accepts input from both a -select multiple- and a set of -fieldset- elements. Two multi-select methods yep, each tailored for their use case.\n\n0:00 - Introduction\n0:45 - Overview\n1:55 - Theming\n2:05 - UI Hints\n2:47 - States\n4:44 - Keyboard\n6:18 - Reduced Motion\n7:06 - Screen Reader\n8:39 - RTL\n9:46 - Layouts\n13:19 - JavaScript\n16:33 - Outro\n\nRead along → https://goo.gle/3DyjjaJ \nTry a demo → https://goo.gle/2YGmPkU \nGet the source → https://goo.gle/3n4Sfcg \n\nWatch more GUI Challenges → https://goo.gle/GUIchallenges\nSubscribe to Google Chrome Developers → http://goo.gl/LLLNvf\n\n#GUIchallenges #CSS #ChromeDeveloper"
