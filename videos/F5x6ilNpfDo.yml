title: 'Karl Gilis - How conversion optimization made me a better interface designer @ Frontend United 2016'
recordingDate: 1465543799
description: "Part 1: Cases\nI start with showing the audience 2 versions of 3 webpages and I ask them which of those versions resulted in more sales & conversions.\nAt WIAD16 95% of the audience had all 3 wrong.\nThey all were information architects, digital strategist and UX designers. They are supposed to know wat works and doesn’t work. Apparently they know shit.\nI then explain why those 3 variations work better. And that they should have known. Because most elements are known and have been published before (user focus on the left, importance of the pagefold, scroll intent, the dangers of big intro photos, distraction of main navigation…)\nAs UX specialist and front-end designers we are responsible for the fundamentals of the interface.\nSo we really need to know what works in 2016. And what doesn’t.\nBased on facts. Not assumptions. Not on what we’ve learned many years ago.\nNot on outdated beliefs.\n\n\nPart 2: 6 reasons why we fail as interface designers\nAnd with ‘we’ I mean all those that are not at Frontend United of course \n• We don’t really care about usability & cro (see all cases of part 1)\n• Our egos are too big (we think we are the experts & we all have our pet-peeves)\n• We want to design the interface of tomorrow (while visitors need to find what they’re looking for today. And our clients want websites that result in many leads and sales today; not within 3 years. )\n• We want to please our clients (but we’re not paid for being liked – we’re paid to make what works best for the business of our clients)\n• We give up fighting to soon (so we add things because our clients ask it – because we don’t have the courage to say and proof why something will not work)\n• New thing make us happy. And blind. (Or how do you explain those websites in Flash, those homepages with carrousels, those stupid video background, … and all those conversion killers that are in our work).\n\nGrand finale\nPlease frontenders of the world: get your act together.\nDo your research. Only make things that you know will really work.\nThe result will not always be a very sexy website.\nBut they will make a difference.\nBe proud to be a frontend designer!"
