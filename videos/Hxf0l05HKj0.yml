description: "http://jdk.io/\n\nJava EE 7 continues the simplification of the APIs for accessing container services while broadening the range of services available. This platform overview focuses on the following areas:\n\nExtension of the platform to encompass emerging Web technologies such as WebSocket and JSON, which provide the underpinnings for HTML5 support in Java EE, as well as the HTTP client API added by JAX-RS\n\nSimplified alignment of managed beans by the leveraging of CDI injection and interceptors to include new JTA declarative transactions, method-level validation, and constructor injection\n\nEnhancements for ease of use, including simplified JMS APIs, the new batch API, expanded resource definition facilities, and the pruning of superseded technologies"
