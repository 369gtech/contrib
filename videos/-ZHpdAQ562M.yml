Treating such delay tolerant traffic as interactive communications is expensive for ISPs because they dimension their networks based on peak levels of utilization, e.g., the 95th percentile. To limit such costs, many ISPs today are considering traffic shapers at the edge of their networks that rate-limit the bandwidth consumed by bulk ows. Unfortunately, due to the offsets in the local peak hours of utilization at different network links, bulk transfers traveling sufficiently far will be throttled by various ISP between the source and destination resulting in very poor end-to-end rates. To reduce the impact of such problems I will introduce a novel Internet architecture for bulk transfers that significantly reduces operational costs and increases end-to-end transmission rates.\r\n\r\nSpeaker Info:  Pablo Rodriguez\r\n\r\nPablo Rodriguez is the Internet Scientific Director at Telefonica. Prior to Telefonica he was a Researcher at Microsoft Research, Cambridge. While at Microsoft he developed the Avalanche P2P system and worked in worked in very popular services, such as Windows Updates, FolderShare, or Xbox live.\r\n\r\nDuring his early research career Pablo worked as a Member of Technical Staff at Bell-Labs, NJ where he developed wireless data acceleration solutions and new content distribution systems. Prior to Bell-Labs, he worked as a software architect for various startups including Inktomi (acquired by Yahoo!) and Tahoe Networks (now part of Nokia). He received his Ph.D. from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL, Lausanne). During his Ph.D. he also worked at AT&T Labs (Shannon Laboratory, Florham Park, NJ). He obtained postgraduate studies from King's College, London and an a B.S. / M.S. in Telecommunication Engineering at the Universidad PÃºblica de Navarra, Spain.\r\n\r\nHe is the keynote speaker for WWW'09; the General Chair for ACM/SIGCOMM '09; a member of the editorial board for IEEE / ACM Transactions on Networking (ToN), and editor for ACM Computer Communications Review SIGCOMM/CCR and IEEE/JSAC. He is also a steering committee member for IEEE / HotWeb."
