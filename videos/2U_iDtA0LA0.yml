description: "Google Tech Talks\nMay, 27 2008\n\nABSTRACT\n\nMobile devices have great potential to increase independence for people with cognitive disabilities. Besides basic communication, which is itself very important, key features include location awareness, which can be used to help with public transportation, and remote management, which allows a caregiver to manage content, such as schedule information, on a user's device. A recent projects course at the University of Colorado developed promising prototypes on the Android platform, and suggested useful platform enhancements, especially relating to speech technology.\n\nSpeaker: Clayton Lewis"
