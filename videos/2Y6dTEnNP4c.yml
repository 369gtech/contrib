title: 'Modern Encryption Enables Testing with Real Data on Oracle Autonomous Database'
language: English
recordingDate: 1558458704
description: "Simon Bain\nCTO\nShieldIO\n\nIn todayâ€™s heavily regulated industries; local and off-shore testers, developers & database QAs are having to find new ways to access real data for their projects. As using masked or mocked-up data could result in delayed time to market due to incomplete or skewed testing results. In session ShieldIO will show how using Netbeans and Java you can create a subset of data from an Autonomous database and secure it in a way that: Encrypts the data but allows for full-text searching, without decrypting; Allows for mathematical equations to be run on the encrypted data & morphs the viewable data. All done in such a way that enables application testing and QA to be carried out on a real data-set, without ever having access to the clear real data."
