recordingDate: 1571148257
description: "Flink is moving quickly, and so does the community driving it. There are many efforts such as the integration of the Chinese-speaking community, the development of a community packages website or improvements to the contribution process.\n\nThe sheer number of efforts make it difficult to keep track of all of them — that’s why this talk will provide an overview of what happened in the past year, and which new community efforts are coming.\n\nJoin this talk if you want to get a condensed overview of non-coding efforts in Flink."
