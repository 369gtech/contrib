language: English
recordingDate: 1623367796
description: "In this keynote presentation we’ll focus on Mobile Security, and discuss recent smartphones related events, signs of compromise on mobile devices, review of recent attacks, review of mobile EDR / DFIR with a deeper dive into mobile investigations.\n\nWe will also explore the state of self-defense on mobile devices, vendors reactions to attacks, the FreeTheSandbox initiative, what is currently missing, and what’s ahead in terms of mobile security.\n\nIt is now clear: there are too many threat actors that have either zero-click or one-click chains on iPhones and Android. FreeTheSandbox.org initiative encourages device vendors to collaborate with device-owners, the security community, and BYOD/CYOD organizations. Currently, device vendors “accidentally collaborate” with thre at-actors through sandbox policies that benefit the bad guys in the name of privacy. The goal of FreeTheSandbox is to provide unrestricted access to device-owners and managed devices should they want it. Such access would allow them to identify more attacks, faster, without the constant risk of delaying, tampering, or destroying mobile DFIR investigations.\n\n=== \n\nZuk Avraham is a world-renowned white-hat security researcher, 2X entrepreneur, angel investor, Founder / Chairman of mobile security company Zimperium, Inc. and Founder / CEO of ZecOps, Inc.\n\nAn innate hacker with a passion for detecting code vulnerabilities, Zuk started his career as a security researcher in the IDF before being recruited by Samsung Electronics, where he published the first return-oriented programming technique for ARM architecture at DEFCON 18 and Blackhat.
