Otherwise a move from non-consumable in-app purchase to a subscription type would involve a major rewrite. Learn how to manage an app's inventory of purchases, get the code base resilient to changes in the business side, and tips on how to implement some more esoteric business models as in-app purchases.\r\nSpeaker: Sasmito Adibowo - iOS Developer @ SAP\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/Singapore-iOS-Dev-Scout-Meetup/events/264800991/\r\n\r\nRecorded by Vina Melody (@vinamelody)\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/BGGGl/"
