description: "JPA is the main building block in most Java projects. However, a lot of developers still use it without a deep understanding of the technology, relying mainly on applying the copy-paste methodology from StackOverflow or existing system entities. During this presentation, I will consolidate knowledge about object-relational mapping. We'll see how lazy loading works under the hood and understand the difference between a set, list or bag. We will also talk about common traps leading to significant decreases in performance or improper behavior of the system.\n\nJakub Kubrynski is a software developer for whom coding is a way of life as well as a hobby.\n\nHe is focused on continuously improving software delivery processes by introducing new technologies and refining Lean methodologies.\n\nFor over 12 years of his professional career, he worked as a software developer, architect, team leader, and manager. He gained experience working on both sides of the delivery process, as a vendor and as a client. Today, he is a speaker, trainer, and co-founder of the online technical assessment platform, Devskiller."
