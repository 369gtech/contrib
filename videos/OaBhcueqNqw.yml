description: "\"Speakers: Yanhui Li, Brian Quinlan\n\nPython is known for its \"\"batteries included\"\" philosophy but no Python developer can live without the language's rich library ecosystem. Unfortunately, as the number of libraries increases, so does the risk of cross-library incompatibilities, or \"\"dependency hell\"\".\n\nDependency hell arises when two libraries have mutually conflicting requirements. These can be very difficult for developers to diagnose and may not be fixable without avoiding certain libraries entirely.\n\nAfter this talk, you - the library author - will have a practical set of simple best practices to follow that will allow you to build libraries that are compatible across the Python ecosystem.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2019 and https://github.com/PyCon/2019-slides\""
