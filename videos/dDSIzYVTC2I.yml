description: "Daniel Porteous\n\nPython 3.7 added the ability to print import times at startup. But what can we do with that data, and is it enough? In this talk we'll look at how to process import time data, structure it, visualise it, and make concrete choices to improve start up time. Python need not be slow to start!\n\nhttps://2019.pycon-au.org/talks/no-time-to-idle-about-profiling-import-time-in-python\n\nPyCon AU, the national Python Language conference, is on again this August in Sydney, at the International Convention Centre, Sydney, August 2 - 6 2019.\n\nVideo licence: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 - https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU\n\nSun Aug  4 14:10:00 2019 at C3.4 & C3.5"
