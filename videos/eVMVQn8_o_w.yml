title: 'D. Ruth Holloway - "Subtle Magic: Moving to Dancer2/DBIx::Class/TT"'
language: English
recordingDate: 1560878022
description: "\"Read the documentation\", we're told...but there's always more to learn. When I started working with Dancer2, DBIx::Class, and Template Toolkit last fall, I'd seen the basics, but I found out very quickly that there's much more to learn. The capabilities of this stack can influence application design from the ground up--database tables, all the way to the final frameworks you might choose to use on the frontend, and not all of those repercussions are immediately clear from merely reading the documentation!\nIn this talk, we'll learn about some of the strengths of these modules and demonstrate how their capabilities can be leveraged to help you work faster and write great web-based applications."
