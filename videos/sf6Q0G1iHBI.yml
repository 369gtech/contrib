description: "Google Tech Talks\nFebruary, 28 2008\n\nABSTRACT\n\nMindfulness meditation, one type of meditation technique, has been shown to\nenhance emotional awareness and psychological flexibility as well as induce\nwell-being and emotional balance. Scientists have also begun to examine how\nmeditation may influence brain functions. This talk will examine the\neffect of mindfulness meditation practice on the brain systems in which\npsychological functions such as attention, emotional reactivity, emotion\nregulation, and self-view are instantiated. We will also discuss how\ndifferent forms of meditation practices are being studied using\nneuroscientific technologies and are being integrated into clinical\npractice to address symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress.\n\nSpeaker: Philippe Goldin\nPhilippe is a research\nscientist and heads the Clinically Applied Affective Neuroscience group in\nthe Department of Psychology at Stanford University. \n\nHe spent 6 years in India and Nepal studying various languages,\nBuddhist philosophy and debate at Namgyal Monastery and the Dialectic\nMonastic Institute, and serving as an interpreter for various Tibetan\nBuddhist lamas. He then returned to the U.S. to complete a Ph.D. in\nClinical Psychology at Rutgers University. His NIH-funded\nclinical research focuses on (a) functional neuroimaging investigations of cognitive-affective mechanisms in adults with anxiety disorders, (b)\ncomparing the effects of mindfulness meditation and cognitive-behavioral\ntherapy on brain-behavior correlates of emotional reactivity and regulation, and (c) training children in family and elementary school settings in mindfulness skills to reduce anxiety and enhance compassion, self-esteem and quality of family interactions."
