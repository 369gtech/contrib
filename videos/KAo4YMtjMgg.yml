title: 'From Zero to Continous Delivery - Concepts, Culture and Overview'
recordingDate: 1543777261
description: 'Continuous delivery is not a pipe-dream technology, reserved only for the “cool kids” at hip tech startups. Although it''s not easy, many concepts are within reach of most teams. That being said, it require more than simple technology changes. In the experience of this author, the tooling and technology are the easy part; the necessary culture changes and convincing everyone to buy into the vision and the initial investment is difficult.This session begins with a brief overview of continuous delivery concepts and business case for CD. Gradle and Jenkins are introduced as tools to manage build and automation. Jenkins 2 introduces jenkinsfiles the concept of pipelines-as-code. We explore what it takes to get a basic pipeline in place quickly and how to follow current best practice to create an evolutionary pipeline that the whole team owns and maintains. This basic pipeline forms the foundation of a longer-term CD transformation effort that won''t fizzle out. .'
