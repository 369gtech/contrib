title: 'microXchg 2016 - Bodo Junglas : Automatic Test generation for REST-APIs'
recordingDate: 1454701460
description: 'One of the main problems of coordinating multiple development teams in a micro-service architecture relies in API documentation and contract testing:One team has to inform other teams about its APIs and depends on other teams to be conform to the APIs they provide.While there are several de-facto standards for documentation of REST-APIs, creating a reliable in test-infrastructure in regard to conformance and downward-compatible changes is still a challenge.We will discuss an approach for contract testing based on Scala-Check and Swagger.'
