description: "Approximately three years ago, the first subatomic particles of what was then known as atom-shell burst forth. While it's positioned itself as the essential element of many apps in the ensuing time, it's safe to say that the Electron of 2018 bears little resemblance to its beginnings. I'll discuss the current state of Electron in terms of how we've evolved, our community, and how we plan to drive advancement of desktop runtimes in the years to come. You'll come away with a solid understanding of the role Electron has played and will continue to play in the larger JS ecosystem.\n\nEVENT:\n\nNode Summit 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nShelley Vohr, Software Engineer, GitHub\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nNode Summit Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to publish this video."
