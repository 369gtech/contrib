title: 'CON6086   The Java EE 8 Opportunity'
language: English
recordingDate: 1450064397
description: "The first era of Java EE was XML-driven. The second era of Java EE, brought about by Java 5, is annotation-driven and very declarative by nature. With the advent of Java 8 features such as lambdas and method references, logic is mobile and Java EE has the opportunity to reinvent itself, this time from the declarative to the programmatic. This session explores the possibilities by taking APIs for security, asynchronous methods, scheduling work, Bean Validation, and interceptors and seeing how they might be fundamentally changed with the new tools we have and how CDI extensions might play a critical role in this shift. Of course, change does not happen overnight. Itâ€™ll take all our ideas to reach the full potential of the Java EE 8 opportunity.\n\nSpeaker:\nDavid Blevins, Founder, Tomitribe\nFounder of Tomitribe, veteran of Open Source Java EE in both implementing and defining Java EE specifications for over 10 years with a strong drive to see Java EE simple, testable and as light as Java SE.
