recordingDate: 1582228811
description: "APIs are what makes the Internet go around. Every SaaS, data driven and on-demand kitten business exposes their data over an external or internal API. Which means you need one too, right? Of course you do.\n\nCreating a secure API that be set up almost instantly for a whole development team to use, can scale up and out, can be extended easily, and can be easily maintained is the Nirvana of API architecture. This is exactly the promise of building an API with Azure Function Proxies.\n\nIn this session, you will learn to quickly create a complete API using Azure Function proxies, forward requests, adhere to best practices, easily extend and more. At the end of the talk we will have built an API that is ready straight away for development against. We then compare this process to other API frameworks to get the real world picture.\n\nLars is an author, trainer, Microsoft MVP, community leader, aspiring Microsoft Azure expert and part time classic car collector.
