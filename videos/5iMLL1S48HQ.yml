recordingDate: 1510222837
description: "Michiel Rook is a Java/PHP/Scala consultant from the Netherlands. He loves coaching teams to develop better software and implement continuous deployment. He is a co-founder of Make.io and a member of the Dutch Web Alliance. When he’s not thinking about continuous deployment, DevOps or event sourcing he enjoys music, cars, sports and movies. Michiel is experienced developer, trainer, coach and conference/event speaker.\n\nConsider a legacy application, no tests, manual releases and low velocity.\nLearn how to replace a legacy application with a modern service-oriented architecture and build a continuous deployment pipeline. I’ll discuss the process, automated testing, monitoring and trunk based development.\n\nIt's a situation many of us are familiar with: a large legacy, monolithic application, limited or no tests, slow & manual release process, low velocity, no confidence...  A lot of refactoring is required, but management keeps pushing for new features.\n\nHow to proceed? Using examples and lessons learned from a real-world case, Michiel will show you how to replace a legacy application with a modern service-oriented architecture and build a continuous integration and deployment pipeline to deliver value from the first sprint. On the way, we’ll take a look at the process, automated testing, monitoring, master/trunk based development and various tips and best practices."
