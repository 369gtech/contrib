description: "by Charles Nutter and Thomas Enebo\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/H.1302/ruby.webm\n\nRubyists work from a command line, which makes JRuby startup time a critical concern. Traditionally, the JVM has not been optimized for startup, but that's changing. This talk will explore all available options for making a heavy runtime like JRuby start up quickly, from using class data caching services like Hotspot's CDS and OpenJ9's Quickstart to ahead-of-time compilation of JRuby using GraalVM's Native Image. We'll compare approaches and trade-offs.\n\nRoom: H.1302 (Depage)\nScheduled start: 2020-02-01 17:20:00"
