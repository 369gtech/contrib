description: "Wait for it: another keynote presentation touting the benefits of Spring, PCF, and CI/CD. We continuously enslave ourselves to subjective analysis and romantic visions of increased productivity and quality using platforms such as PCF and Spring as the underlying infrastructure for cloud native applications. The same argumentative paradigm also carries over into CI/CD discussions using pipelined tools such as Concourse. But like contemplating the dream of dwelling in a beach front paradise, it can be hard to objectively quantify the realization of living in a wonderland vs. only articulating high level benefits of a new blissful world. Now, put yourself in the board room sitting in front of your CIO, CFO, CEO and the rest of the 3-letter execution squad; judgement day is here, and it's time to testify. After your hard work, what tangible benefits do you bring to the table? Your top brass isn't as interested in the experience, but instead want to see hard line numbers of productivity and improvement. If you know where to look and what to look for, the metrics are there lying in plain sight. This presentation will take a pragmatic and quantitative look at the benefits obtained through the use of Spring, PCF, and Concourse. It will cover: a high level overview of the Cerner business case for PCF and the projected benefits, tools and methods to gather before and after metrics, and quantitative analysis of real world scenarios from actual experiences in the field.\nSpeakers: Bryan Kelly, Sr Software Architect, Cerner Corp\nGreg Meyer Director, Principal Architect, Distinguished Engineer, Cerner Corp\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
