description: "In this talk from the 2013 Northeast Scala Symposium, Bill Venners will focus on how to achieve simplicity in Scala library, DSL, and application design. Bill will highlight general principles that can be applied to any programming language, and show specific techniques that can be used in Scala to implement the general principles and help you manage complexity in your Scala projects.\n\n\"The focus is really not simplifying your library design, but simplifying your users' life when they use your library.\"\n\n** For more great Scala content, educational resources, and training, head to http://bit.ly/nescala13"
