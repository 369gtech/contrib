description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nOpen Source Adulthood: What We Learned About Growing Up - Jean-Philippe Evrard, SUSE & Kendall Nelson, OpenStack Foundation \n\nWith dozens of companies and countries, with thousands of people contributing to a single open source project, the community is bound to face some growing pains. On the rise there are more and more people every day hoping to contribute their new feature whether it actually fits in the project or not. For a while there are more resources than community knows what to do with, but eventually, a new project will come along and hopefully they can learn from the challenges that the projects before them faced. In this talk, attendees will learn about one open source community's rise in popularity and the transition to stable, mature project. Attendees will learn from the struggles of the OpenStack community and will be able to take the lessons we learned back to the Kubernetes and other CNCF communities.\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zen0"
