description: "This video was recorded at Code Mesh LDN 18 http://bit.ly/2P7SPII\n\nGet involved in Code Sync's next conference http://bit.ly/2Mcm4aS\n\n---\n\nBREAKING CHANGES\nby James Coglan\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nOpen source\nLanguage\nCommunication\n\nABSTRACT\nSemantic Versioning has become a de-facto standard in the last few years, with several language ecosystems now relying on it to manage software upgrades. However, it is frequently misunderstood as a technical tool for making cold hard guarantees about code, rather than as a human tool for signalling intent and setting expectations.\n\nNever is this more apparent than when we consider what a \"breaking change\" means. It's highly contextual: it depends on which language you're using, what your public interface is, what guarantees you've explicitly or implicitly made to users, how much software sits downstream of you, and so on. In this talk James will explore several ways you can accidentally break other people's JavaScript apps, how to avoid them, and what to do when you can't.\n\nRead the full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/james-coglan/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - JAMES COGLAN\nOpen source developer and independent author\n\n\nJames has been working in software for twelve years, primarily as a back-end web developer, most recently in the live music and online education sectors. He\ncreated the open-source web messaging system Faye, whose internals now form the\nbasis of much WebSocket tooling in the Ruby and JavaScript ecosystems. James also enjoys hacking on language tools, creating the cross-language parser generator Canopy, and a toy logic programming language called Infer.\n\nJames is the author of the book JavaScript Testing Recipes, and am working on a second called Building Git, available in 2019.\n\nMore on James Coglan: https://codesync.global/speaker/james-coglan/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE MESH LDN 18\nCode Mesh LDN is powered by Code Sync.
