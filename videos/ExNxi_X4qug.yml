description: 'As the cost of DNA sequencing has dropped, the volume of data produced has risen into the petabytes. Google is working with the genomics community to define a standard API for working with big genomic data sets in the cloud. Building on Google Cloud Platform, we show how to store, process, explore and share genomic data using technologies like BigQuery, AppEngine MapReduce, R and more.'
