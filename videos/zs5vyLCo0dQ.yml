description: "Deep Dive: Kubernetes (PM) SIG - Ihor Dvoretskyi, CNCF & Stephen Augustus, VMware \n\nKubernetes is one of the most high-velocity open source projects in the world, and one of the most unique features of this community project - that it has its own PM team and PM process. SIG-PM, originally established as a Product Management Group, today covers multiple aspects of Product, Program and Project Management of Kubernetes. In this session, the SIG-PM co-chairs will run a deep dive session on the SIG-PM community-wide responsibilities, day-to-day responsibilities, together with working on the real-world cases. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPjc"
