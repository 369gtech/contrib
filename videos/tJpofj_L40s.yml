title: 'YOW! Connected 2016 Mike Gouline - Kotlin: The Pragmatic Language for Android'
recordingDate: 1485156353
description: "Kotlin, a relatively new programming language running on the JVM, has been making headlines as the more elegant alternative to Java in any of its applications. One of them is Android development and this talk will explore the benefits that the language offers for everyday coding.\n\nThe presentation will start by explaining what Kotlin is, who developed it and what their motivation was. Continuing on from there, there will be a demonstration of notable features of the language that set it apart from Java. Once the audience is more comfortable with the syntax, Android development will be introduced as a use case for the language, explaining what the benefits are and what it takes to start using Kotlin in existing apps. Finally, the conclusion will have some information about future developments and more learning resources for those interested.\n\nMike is a mobile developer who focuses primarily on Android but still maintains interest in iOS and back-end development. His passion is creating software that doesn’t just do the job, but does it elegantly, efficiently and in a way that feels native to the platform.\n\nMike’s career has so far revolved around creating mobile apps, designing architecture and leading teams for various companies, from early-stage startups to well-established corporations.\n\nHe’s a regular blogger and contributor to the local meetup scene.\n\nFor more on YOW!
