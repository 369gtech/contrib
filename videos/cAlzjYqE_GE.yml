description: "Speaker: James Yong\n\nOver the past 6 years I've been helping friends prepare for technical interviews with purely technical exercises. Just a year ago I had to go through job-hunting myself and decided to thoroughly analyze various non-technical aspects throughout my journey.\n\nThis (intense) session with both mini-exercises and stories would serve as both a motivational driver and informative session for attendees. This is also the first time I would share this.\n\nRough outline:\n==============\n- Impostor Syndrome\n- Depression\n- Finding Purpose\n- Psych\n- Personal Goals\n- Company Culture\n- Negotiation\n- Acceptance\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/yongkimleng/\n\nSlides: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pvpstHjMomekJTIxyUTngU1TERctjZ6w/view?usp=sharing\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/Junior-Developers-Singapore/events/267505139/ \r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\r\nRecorded by: Michael Cheng"
