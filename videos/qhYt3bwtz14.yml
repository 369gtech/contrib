title: 'Deep Dive: Integrating 3D Models and IoT data with iTwin and Azure Digital Twins'
language: English
recordingDate: 1596470410
description: "In this session we will demonstrate an application that combines 3D models, 2D maps, and reality mesh into a single environment for visualization. (More info on the application from Deep Dive can be found here: https://medium.com/imodeljs/road-to-iot-15a6ce1c43e1 )  Within that environment we will demonstrate a live, real time, seamless visualization of IoT data streams.  Next we will walk through the architecture that enables the application.  We will show how we have mapped the IoT data to the assets within the digital twin.  And we will show how to keep the digital twin in step with engineering changes.  This is done by automating the generation of the Digital Twin Description Language (DTDL) .JSON.\n\nBentley's iTwin platform and iModel.js open-source programming library provide powerful capabilities for aggregating 3D, 2D, reality data and other sources to link with IoT data for a \"single pane of glass\" visualization, analytics, and simulation so users can make more effective decisions in a timely manner. By integrating the iTwin platform with Azure Digital Twins and other Azure IoT services, Bentley and Microsoft are making it easier for developers, integrators, and customers to build digital twins of their infrastructure assets.\n\nGuest Speakers: \nJosh Schifter – Sr. Software Development Manager, Bentley Systems\nRoop Saini – Software Developer, Bentley Systems\nDeep Dive Host:\nPamela Cortez - Azure IoT Senior PM\n\nResources:\n- Get started with iModel.js: https://www.imodeljs.org/\n- Learn more about iTwin: https://www.bentley.com/en/products/product-line/digital-twins/itwin\n- Blog: https://medium.com/imodeljs/road-to-iot-15a6ce1c43e1\n- Source Code: https://github.com/iModeljs-meets-AzureDT/civil-iot\n- Learn more about the new capabilities for Azure Digital Twins: Technical Deep Dive: https://aka.ms/deepdive/digital-twins-live\n- List of supported formats for iTwin: https://communities.bentley.com/products/digital-twin-cloud-services/itwin-services/w/imodel-bridges-wiki/47595/supported-file-formats"
