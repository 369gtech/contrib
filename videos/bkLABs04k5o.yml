description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM SF 2020 - http://bit.ly/2wpn0SM\n\nGet involved in Code Sync's next conference - https://codesync.global\n\n---\n\nKEYNOTE\nBEAM ON THE EDGE - INNOVATION THROUGH PROBLEM SOLVING\nby Robert Virding & Frank Hunleth\n\n\nABSTRACT\n\"BEAM on the Edge” explores designing innovative solutions under ambiguous circumstances. Robert Virding discusses how the core Erlang team took a different path from the rest of the software world in the design and reason of the BEAM itself. Frank Hunleth describes the burgeoning world of IoT, problems that the BEAM is well suited to solve, and now Nerves makes those solutions a reality. Frank Savage takes us to the world of functional GUI, why http isn’t appropriate to solve all problems and how Scenic uses the BEAM to explore solutions in this space.\n\nSlides & full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/frank-hunleth/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - ROBERT VIRDING\nCo-creator of Erlang\n\nRobert Virding is Principal Language Expert at Erlang Solutions Ltd. While at Ericsson AB, Robert was one of the original members of the Ericsson Computer Science Lab, and co-inventor of the Erlang language. He took part in the original system design and contributed much of the original libraries, as well as to the current compiler. While at the lab he also did a lot of work on the implementation of logic and functional languages and on garbage collection. He has also worked as an entrepreneur and was one of the co-founders of one of the first Erlang startups (Bluetail). Robert also worked a number of years at the Swedish Defence Materiel Administration (FMV) Modelling and Simulations Group. He co-authored the first book (Prentice-Hall) on Erlang, and is regularly invited to teach and present throughout the world.\n\nMore on Robert Virding: https://codesync.global/speaker/robert-virding/\n\n\nTHE SPEAKER - FRANK HUNLETH\nNerves co-author\n\nFrank has built embedded Linux-based software for products in many industries including medical, consumer, telecommunications and defense. He is a coauthor of the Nerves project and maintains several projects used in embedded Elixir-based devices such as the Elixir Circuits set of libraries, toolshed, fwup, and erlinit.\n\nMore on Frank Hunleth: https://codesync.global/speaker/frank-hunleth/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM SF 2020\nCode BEAM SF is powered by Code Sync.
