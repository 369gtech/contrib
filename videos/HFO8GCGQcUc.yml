title: '#HITBLockdown D1 - 60 CVEs In 60 Days - Eran Shimony'
language: English
recordingDate: 1590013036
description: "In recent years, the most effective way to discover new vulnerabilities is considered to be fuzzing. I will present a complementary approach to fuzzing called MTE. By using MTE, I managed to get over 60 CVEs, all are logical vulnerabilities, in 60 days across many major software vendors like Microsoft, Facebook, Intel, and more. Some things never die – In this session, we’ll show that a huge amount of software is still vulnerable to DLL Hijacking and Symlinks abuse and may allow attackers to escalate their privileges or DoS a machine. We will show how we generalized these two techniques within an automated testing system called Ichanea, with the aim – finding new vulnerabilities.\n\n=== \n\nEran Shimony is a security researcher at CyberArk. Eran has an extensive background in security research that includes years of experience in malware analysis and vulnerability research on multiple platforms. With a growing interest in logical vulnerabilities, he has several dozens of acknowledged vulnerabilities across major vendors, like Microsoft, Intel, Samsung, and many others. Besides finding security bugs, he enjoys making cocktails and listening to heavy metal and classical music."
