description: "Code is Here: http://goo.gl/dzqhV\n\nWelcome to my Proxy Design Pattern Tutorial! The Proxy design pattern limits access to just the methods you want made accessible in another class.\n\nIt can be used for security reasons, because an Object is intensive to create, or is accessed from a remote location. You can think of it as a gate keeper that blocks access to another Object.\_I demonstrate how the proxy pattern works using some code used in my state design pattern tutorial. You may want to check that tutorial out before proceeding.\n\nState Design Pattern Tutorial: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGEx35FjBuo"
