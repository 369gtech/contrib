description: "Presented by Carter Rabasa at JSLA (js.la) on Thursday June 27th 2014 - WebRTC is revolutionizing the way we handle voice, video and data communication by providing native peer-to-peer communication inside the browser. However unless you're familiar with terms like STUN and TURN, actually deploying an end-to-end WebRTC solution is difficult.\n\nAt Twilio we use WebRTC to power Twilio Client which enables web developers to embed VOIP in their applications. In this talk I'll provide an overview of how Twilio works and do some live coding with Twilio Client and Node to turn my browser into a phone.\n\ntwitter.com/carterrabasa\ngithub.com/crabasa"
