description: "Sung to the tune of “My Favorite Things” from the Sound of Music:\n\n“Stakeholders pausing and missing their deadlines,\nEngineers working to tag all the headlines,\nScheduling has me all tied up with strings,\nThese are a few project management things!”\n______\n\nStanding ovations at MidCamp!\nPeriscoped at Twin Cities DrupalCamp!\nTook Memphis by storm at HighEdWeb!\n\nNow the hottest new musical comes to DrupalCon . . . no, not Hamilton. It’s \"Project Management: The Musical!\"\n\nAll great musicals tell stories of some sort of journey. It’s usually a tale of overcoming some type of adversity, with plot twists, occasional heartbreak, and humor. And isn’t that what a Drupal project is? Musicals simply include songs to help move the plot along.\n\nUsing a case study format, we’re going to give an overview — with a soundtrack! — of how to best manage a Drupal website design and development project from contracting to post-launch. We’ll share tools and spreadsheets, outline steps to get organized for both kickoff meetings and sprint planning, discuss the Agile process, give techniques on how to manage team members and clients, and learn about how project managers can overcome the odds to navigate to a fantastic product at the end.\n\nDon’t be fooled by the music: It’s going to be informative, as well as very, very musical.\n\nYou will learn items such as:\n\nhow to get your project organized for success right from the start\ngetting to know your contract\nhow to organize kickoff meetings with the client to ensure success for the project\nwhat analytics and KPIs to review\nwhat to do when stakeholders disapprove\nhow to handle scope creep\nhow to do proper sprint planning\nhow to survive a project with humor through use of the occasional show tune\nThis session is not technical, and is great for both beginning and advanced project managers alike. A general knowledge of popular Broadway musicals is helpful, though not required."
