title: 'Serverless Machine Learning: predicting the future with the bleeding edge - Asavari Tayal'
recordingDate: 1554231835
description: "I’ll introduce the high level concepts of machine learning and demonstrate how serverless can make it easier. With event-driven auto scale and a completely managed hosting platform, data scientists and application developers no longer need to worry about setting up the infrastructure components or learning about DevOps and Containers. Combine this with the convenience of the FaaS programming model and you’ve got an application that can trigger and fetch input data from almost any event in the cloud, so you can infer and make predictions in real time!\n\nWebsite: https://boston.serverlessdays.io"
