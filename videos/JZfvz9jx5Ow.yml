In this very hands on session I will give you a kick start into mobile development. I will introduce you to the available mobile runtimes, editors, build services, debugging tools, testing environments, reporting tools and finally relevant app stores. After this talk you should have a good overview of what is relevant today, what tools will do the best job for you and how you can keep building future proof mobile cross-platform applications.\n\nAbout Nikolai: https://twitter.com/nonken\nAbout Mobilism: https://mobilism.nl"
