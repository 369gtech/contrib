description: "I am consultant/trainer and conference speaker with focus on combining traditional IT Management (am ITIL Expert), Project Management (am IPMA assessor) and new approaches such as Agile, Lean, Kanban etc. Board member at IPMA Latvia, teaching Programme and Project Portfolio Management for masters in Project Management. Have a degree in Computer Sciences and Executive MBA from Stockholm School of Economics. Worked for large telecoms (C&W, TeliaSonera, Kinnevik/Tele2) and as CIO for a global retail chain Hutchison/ASWatsons.\n\nCreating children book in 45 minutes thanks to Scrum\n\nCreating a book is not a simple project however applying Agile principles to the process might make it much more easier to manage and give you better results. During the workshop we will create a children's book by using Scrum techniques. You will stay awake as workshop requires your active participation, gives ability to have fun and engage your creativity. I have done interactive workshops on IPMA congreses, Agile events, at company offices and business schools and these are always perceived very well, as there are always some people who prefer \"learning by doing\"."
