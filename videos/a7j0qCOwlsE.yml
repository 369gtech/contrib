Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nLightning Talk: Connecting the (Proxy) Dots: A Beginners Guide to Reading Envoy Debug Logs - Casey Kurosawa, Ambassador Labs\n\nIn the world of support engineering, one of the most valuable questions you can answer is \"where is this problem coming from?\" When it comes to debugging Envoy Proxy-based applications -- where the traffic can be coming in and out, backwards and sideways -- it can be particularly difficult to answer this question when you’re trying to figure out why a request is failing. This talk will provide a brief overview of how Envoy is structured, and then conduct a live walk through of the debug logs of a request. Attendees will learn how the information in these logs relate to Envoy's internal mechanics."
