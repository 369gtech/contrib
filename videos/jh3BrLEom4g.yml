description: "Those who have read SRE book, noticed those abbreviations, but mostly nobody actually started using on a daily basis. At AnchorFree, we have several thousands of nodes, and hundreds of services, we have 3 SRE teams dealing with all of this with reasonable success.\n\nIn this talk Iâ€™m going to describe how Core SRE team implemented SLO and error budgets on practice, what where our pitfalls, and how you might try to do it yourself. Should you even bother?"
