description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2018\n—\nThe Concepts TS -- the ISO-published Technical Specification for \nconstrained templates -- was merged into the C++20 Working Paper in \n2016. This is a big deal for C++. We've been missing this kind of \nlanguage feature for nearly 30 years. Well... now that we have it, \nit's probably a good idea to know what it's for and how to use it. \n\nThis talk covers basic topics of generic programming using concepts. \nI will talk about using concepts to write constrained templates, \noverloading constrained functions (why, when, and how), and how to \ndefine good concepts (which is a bit trickier than you might imagine). \n\nI will also discuss some of the changes to the syntax and semantics \nof language features in the Concepts TS when it was merged into \nthe Working Paper for C++20.\n— \nAndrew Sutton, University of Akron\n\nAndrew Sutton is an Assistant Professor at the University of Akron where\nhe teaches, hacks on compilers and other interesting problems, and writes the\noccasional research papers. Dr. Sutton is a member of the C++ Standards Committee,\nthe editor of the Concepts Technical Specification, and implemented concepts in\nGCC. He has spent the past year working on language support for software-defined\nnetworking and on C++ support for compile-time programming, reflection, and\nmetaclasses as an extension of the Clang C++ Compiler.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
