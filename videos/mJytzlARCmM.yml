description: "Talk in three words: types, static-code-analysis, Gradualizer\n\nAbstract\nType systems and gradual typing is beautiful and a type checker for Elixir that finds all type errors at compile time would be very useful. Putting the theory aside, Peter will explore the everyday difficulties of implementing such a type checker and testing it properly.\n\nObjectives\nAfter this talk attendees will value the many years of development and discipline that was put into Dialyzer and also see what added-value Gradualizer can bring.\n\nAudience\nDevelopers interested in type-checking.\n\nThe speaker \nPeter spent quite a few years at Ericsson where he became an Erlang native. Later he utilised his experience in various other industries from sports-betting to online ad servers at Erlang Solutions. Recently, he has joined Appliscale to fight cloud-scale systems.\nGithub: gomoripeti\n\nElixirConf EU\nWebsite: www.elixirconf.eu\nTwitter: www.twitter.com/elixirconfeu\nMail: info at elixirconfeu"
