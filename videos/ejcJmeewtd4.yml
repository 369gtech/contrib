description: "The story behind Google Docs Offline and some of the fantastic hacks put in place to make it work. We changed people's mindsets to \"think offline\" while re-architecting the apps to not rely on the network. Moving an internet company offline involves some hard work and has some serious challenges (performance, cross-browser compatibility, platform bugs, etc).\n\nFor reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
