description: "Josh Simmons\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/34/\n\nWe all rely on open source software and, as our reliance grows, so do our policies for managing compliance and programs for cultivating mutually supportive relationships with the communities behind the software. \r\n\r\nIn this session, attendees will be given a thorough accounting of: \r\n* what companies are doing to support open source communities, \r\n* what kind of support open source communities are actually asking for, \r\n* how to build a culture of open source citizenship in your company,\r\n* and how to make it easy for companies to support your community.\r\n\r\nBased on discussions with industry and community leadership, we'll establish a current and sweeping perspective on corporate open source engagement. \r\n\r\nBy understanding the state of the art, and knowing what needs remain unmet, we can help our companies be even more effective in supporting healthy communities. And not just because it's the right thing to do... \r\n\r\nAfter all, healthy communities translate into greater productivity, innovation, and stability, and better security!\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
