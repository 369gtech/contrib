description: "Backbone of the Swiss Financial Center Goes DevOps\n\nRobert Scherrer, Head Application Engineering, SIX\n\nAs the infrastructure backbone of the Swiss financial center, SIX provides a comprehensive set of critical services with utmost reliability, among them the Swiss Exchange and the Swiss Franc system and is highly regulated.\n\nAs the company definitely had not waited for a major cultural transformation, choosing an ideal business line to start, involving doers with leadership skills and managing the stakeholders was as critical as implementing technology and processes. The transformation journey at SIX shows the cultural challenges, where true leadership and trust replaces command and control behaviour and teams take over responsibility while clear roles of the individual disappear. But exactly within these changes lies the key to tackle ever moving constraints and waiting times to deliver faster and more effectively aligned to business needs.\n\nDOES17 London\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/eur/"
