title: 'Kostya Gorskiy: Designing a better bot'
recordingDate: 1542047168
description: "Artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities have made leaps and bounds in the past few years, but the products and interfaces we’ve built with that technology haven’t caught up. Design plays a huge part in how users interact with bots, but there are very few examples of good bot interfaces out there right now. How do you build a great product that’s also smart and solve for problems that haven’t come up yet? Kostya will share the lessons learned building Intercom’s new bot interface, the principles that make a powerful bot, and real-world examples of how it’s being used. He’ll also address the future of bot conversations, what we can expect from digital assistants and how our conversations will adapt to the new technology. - Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/amuse\n\nSave the date!
