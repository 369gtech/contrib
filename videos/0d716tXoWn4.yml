title: 'YOW! Conference 2018 - Randy Shoup - Attitude Determines Altitude - Engineering Yourself'
recordingDate: 1550440800
description: "Attitude Determines Altitude - Engineering Yourself\n\nSuccess is not determined by our aptitude -- our skill at a particular task. Instead, it is determined by our attitude -- how we go about it. It is far less the contributions of genetics, or education, or circumstance than it is how we approach challenges, limitations, and opportunities in our lives. Through real science and some very personal stories, we will discuss how you can use your attitude to improve yourself.\nWe begin by discussing Growth Mindset - Carol Dweck's idea that we can improve ourselves through sustained effort. Focus and attention will help us put in the 10,000 hours of deliberate practice that allow us to achieve mastery.\nWe then discuss Trust - by trusting others to do their part and to do it well we can achieve both greater personal happiness and better business results. Generative organizations and psychological safety in teams are key themes.\nWe finally discuss Confidence - from the underconfidence of the Impostor Phenomenon to the overconfidence of the Dunning-Kruger effect. Most importantly, we conclude with practical ways you can build and sustain your own confidence in yourself.\n\nRandy is VP Engineering at WeWork. Previously, he has been VP Engineering at Stitch Fix, Engineering Director at Google, and Chief Engineer at eBay. Randy is a frequent keynote speaker and consultant in areas from scalability and cloud computing, to analytics and data science, to engineering culture and DevOps. He is particularly interested in the nexus of people, culture, and technology.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
