title: 'Writing Unadulterated Services with Kotlin and Coroutines'
language: English
recordingDate: 1632327470
description: "\"In this session, Zohaib Sibte Hassan will talk about the fragmented landscape of async IO in the JVM world. \n \n We'll then go over how Kotlin, and coroutines can be used to write nice sequential code combining various approaches to async IO. \n \n We'll also take a look at Spring applications using classic reactor patterns, and then using the first-class Spring Kotlin coroutine support to convert that code into sequential looking beautiful code, without any callback hell despite differences in libraries. This makes code easy to read, and reason for.\"\n\nZohaib Sibte Hassan, Tech Lead Manager at DoorDash\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/writing-unadulterated-services-with-kotlin-and-coroutines-250102991"
