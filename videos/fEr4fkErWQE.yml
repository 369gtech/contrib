description: "Google Tech Talk\r\nMarch 9, 2009\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nSpeaker: Matt Cottam\r\n\r\nWhat is a switch? Is there a place for the Army at an art school? How do physical and ubiquitous computing fit in the industrial design curriculum? Is interaction design just 21st Century industrial design? Can designers and engineers play nicely? And what do high altitude and disaster medicine have to do with any of this? In a fast-paced and highly visual presentation, Matt Cottam will discuss these ideas and others, sharing work from his professional practice as a designer and medic, and drawing from experiences as student and teacher."
