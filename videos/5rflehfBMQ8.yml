title: 'Berlin Buzzwords 2011: Mathias Stearn - Scaling with MongoDB'
recordingDate: 1545060761
description: "For applications that outgrow the resources of a single database server, MongoDB can convert to a sharded cluster, automatically managing failover and balancing of nodes, with few or no changes to the original application code. This talk starts by discussing when to shard and continues on to describe MongoDB's sharding architecture. We'll describe how to configure a shard cluster and provide several example topologies. We'll also give some advice on schema design for sharding and how to pick the best shard key.\n\nhttp://2011.berlinbuzzwords.de/content/scaling-mongodb\n\nDescription of Mathias Stearn: http://2011.berlinbuzzwords.de/content/mathias-stearn"
