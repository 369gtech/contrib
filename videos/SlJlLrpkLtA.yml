description: "Postmortem. Admitting and learning from our mistakes is, imho, incredibly important if we are to become better programmers. In this postmortem video I share and dissect my most recent massive failure.\n\nKnowing about Agile, Lean, MVPs, Incremental Development, and so on, is one thing. Actually successfully executing upon it is a whole different beast.\n\nI try to take full responsibility for my actions, include my mistakes, which is why I'm making this video. What's the reason for failing if not to learn.\n\nWhat do you think? Was I simply stupid? Do you have any similar experiences? Share your thoughts.\n\nMORE VIDEOS\n\n► AGILE MANIFESTO (playlist)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrhzvIcii6GM4saJUqkuc_7IAEU1BBTLZ\n\n► Minimum Viable Products (MVP) (video)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s87Hj5PAj-4\n\n► Patreon\nhttp://patreon.christopherokhravi.com"
