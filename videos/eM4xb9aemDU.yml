title: 'Containers in Production: It’s Like Orchestrating Cats - David Ostrovsky'
recordingDate: 1534245642
description: "You’ve finally installed Docker and typed ‘docker run hello-world’ into the terminal - congratulations! You have taken the first out of about a thousand steps to having your containerized application run in production. Let’s talk about the other nine hundred and ninety nine.\nWe need to look at container orchestration: who creates the containers, how many and when, who makes sure they stay up or get upgraded? We need to look at monitoring, which needs to go from looking at easily identifiable machines, to amorphous cloud applications that span multiple machines and keep moving around. We have to have get logging and debug information from our containers. We must consider security and service discovery. The list of buzzwords is long, but we’ll do our best to cover it in this talk. We will look at Docker Swarm, Kubernetes and Amazon Container Service for orchestration and discuss how to monitor, debug and secure containerized applications both on-prem and in the cloud."
