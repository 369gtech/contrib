description: "Jonathan Oxer\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/101/\n\nLearn how Open Source hardware and software can be used in a wide variety of assistive technologies, including wheelchair control, environmental systems, robotics, communication, prosthetics, games, and telepresence.\r\n\r\nTechnology can be used to dramatically improve the lives of people with physical disabilities. Often this takes the form of medical technology, which is a highly regulated field involving very high development costs and long product lifecycles.\r\n\r\nMedical technology is a critical element in supporting people with physical disabilities, and generally focuses on solving problems that are life-threatening or can otherwise be classified as having a medical imperative. Outside of medical technology that directly interacts with the human body, there is an enormous field of assistive technology that can be used to improve the lives of people both physically and mentally but does not have the same level of regulatory overhead.\r\n\r\nTechnologies that are frequently dismissed as gimmicks or toys, such as home automation systems and IoT devices, can be life-changing for people with disabilities. Not just toys for rich lazy people, home automation can make the difference between an individual being able to live independently or requiring residential care. Even more importantly, it can place the power back in the hands of the individual and give them the ability to control the world around them instead of relying on the help of others.\r\n\r\nBecause the needs of individuals can vary dramatically, the Open Source ethos of modularity, improvement, adaptation, and sharing is ideally suited to assistive technologies. Existing projects can be rapidly remixed and modified to suit specific requirements by combining open source software, hardware, and fabrication including 3D printing and CNC machining. Open Source technologies can give people with disabilities new powers far beyond what an average human can achieve, turning them into DIY superhumans.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
