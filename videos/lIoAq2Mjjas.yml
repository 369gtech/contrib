This talk will focus on the automation infrastructure and test tools that have been built to help make that vision a reality. Various teams within Nest have been working on both cross-platform and device/feature specific systems for automated regression test and analysis. Using specific examples from real world product testing, we will cover cross-product hardware in the loop testing infrastructure and power regression analysis tools, along with camera and motion detection specific tool sets."
