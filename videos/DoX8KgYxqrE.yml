recordingDate: 1340713479
description: "Erlang User Conference 2012 \n\"Erlang allows for technically excellent solutions, but reaching such a solution is, by itself, no guarantee of success. How to achieve real innovation and market success is often non-intuitve, especially for the typical technically-focused and logically-minded developer driven to make programs run faster, make code more beautiful, add cool features, or use the latest hot technology. Writing great code isn't nearly enough; if developers want their systems to succeed, then regardless of whether they work on proprietary systems or open source, they need to fully understand how innovation and markets actually work. In this talk, Steve will explain critical aspects and details of innovation, based in part on example projects and products from his 28 year career. \"\nwww.erlang-solutions.com\nwww.erlang-factory.com\n\nFollow us on Twitter @Erlangfactory  https://twitter.com/#!/erlangfactory \nJoin our group on Linkedin Erlang Factory  http://www.linkedin.com/groups/Erlang-Factory-2003110?trk=myg_ugrp_ovr"
