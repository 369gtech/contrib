description: "Creating the future of Java is a community effort. This session reviews the global participation in OpenJDK. Starting with OpenJDK bugathons and extending to AdoptJSR and AdoptOpenJDK efforts, it showcases the community of developers and projects that support and make up the larger OpenJDK ecosystem.\n\n\nAuthors:\nDalibor Topic\nDalibor Topic works as a Java F/OSS Ambassador for Sun Microsystems in Hamburg, Germany. His open source and free software credentials go back to co-maintaining the Kaffe VM, and hacking on GNU Classpath to provide a fully open source runtime for applications written in the Java programming language.\n\nWith the advent of OpenJDK, his focus shifted to growing the OpenJDK Community, getting open source Java into the core of GNU/Linux distributions, bringing new ports into the OpenJDK Project, and core Java modularity.\nView more trainings by Dalibor Topic at https://www.parleys.com/author/dalibor-topic\n\nDonald Smith\nDonald Smith, MBA, MS, is senior director of product management for Oracle.
