Funqual is a static analysis tool that reads C++17 code ”in the wild” and checks that the function call graph follows a set of  rules which can be defined by the user. This sort of analysis can help the programmer to avoid errors such as accidentally calling blocking functions in time-sensitive contexts or accidentally allocating memory in heap-sensitive environments. To accomplish this, we create a type system whereby functions can be given user-defined type qualifiers and where users can define their own restrictions on the call tree based on these type qualifiers. We demonstrate that this tool, when used with hand-crafted rules, can catch certain types of errors which commonly occur in the wild. We claim that this tool can be used in a production setting to catch certain kinds of errors in code before that code is even run.\n— \nAndrew Nelson, Arista Networks\nSoftware Engineer\n\nAndrew is passionate about creating tools and methodologies that enable everyone to write high quality software. He recently completed a masters degree at Cal Poly SLO where his area of research involved static analysis. Today he works at Arista Networks on tools that make developers more productive. Andrew spends a lot of his free time teaching Computer Science to high school students (he mentors a highschool robotics team and tutors students in AP Computer Science) and has seen a lot of interesting bugs while doing so!\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
