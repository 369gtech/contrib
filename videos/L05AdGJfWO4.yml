description: "What if you could predict user behavior with smart UIs? In this talk, we will explore how we can make adaptive and intelligent user interfaces that learn from how individual users use your apps, and personalize the interface and features just for them, in real-time. With probability-driven statecharts, decision trees, reinforcement learning and more, UIs can be developed in such a way that it automatically adapts to the userâ€™s behavior\n\nEVENT:\n\nReactiveConf 2019\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nDavid Khourshid\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\n\nConference Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish ReactiveConf videos."
