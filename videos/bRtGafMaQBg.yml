description: "Administering Cloud Foundry in the Enterprise: Roles, Needs and Goals - Lucinio Santos & Carl Swanson, IBM\n\nThis agile design-thinking workshop aims at understanding the roles, goals and needs of Cloud Foundry administrators in the enterprise. Participants jointly will model the Cloud Foundry administrative roles, along with the tasks, motivations, and obstacles currently experienced by those roles. The focus is on the enterprise and the dimensions around access control, isolation, scaling, updating, monitoring, and capacity management. This is a participatory exercise where attendants get to express, discuss, prioritize and synthesize through design-thinking methods. The discussion and outcomes will give the Cloud Foundry community a better understanding of the administration needs of enterprises, and of design thinking concepts.\n\nhttps://cfseu18.sched.com/event/FRyW/administering-cloud-foundry-in-the-enterprise-roles-needs-and-goals-lucinio-santos-carl-swanson-ibm"
