description: "Last episode, we treated our Decision Tree as a blackbox. In this episode, we'll build one on a real dataset, add code to visualize it, and practice reading it - so you can see how it works under the hood. And hey -- I may have gone a little fast through some parts. Just let me know, I'll slow down. Also: we'll do a Q&A episode down the road, so if anything is unclear, just ask!\n\nFollow https://twitter.com/random_forests for updates on new episodes!\n\nSubscribe to the Google Developers: http://goo.gl/mQyv5L - \nSubscribe to the brand new Firebase Channel: https://goo.gl/9giPHG\nAnd here's our playlist: https://goo.gl/KewA03"
