title: 'Applying Reinforcement Learning in Industry'
language: English
recordingDate: 1624177075
description: "PyData Cyprus June 2021 meetup\n\nAbstract\n-----------------------\nMost people are familiar with or have heard that Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been employed successfully on games. The biggest example is AlphaGo, developed by DeepMind, the first computer program to defeat the strongest Go player in history. The process of learning continuously from the feedback of the environment sounds very appealing for solving e-commerce use cases. Why we don't see many applied RL use cases? In this talk, Pavlos will explain how Contextual Multi-Armed-Bandits, which is a family of RL algorithms, can be exploited for applied use cases. Contextual MABs are able to optimize directly business KPIs (Conversion, CTR, etc), no training data is required and are use case agnostic.\n\nAbout the speaker\n-----------------------\nPavlos Mitsoulis is a Staff Data Scientist leading the Reinforcement Learning team at Expedia Group and the co-creator of Sagify, an open source MLOps CLI tool to easily train, tune and deploy ML models on Sagemaker by implementing just a train and a predict function. His interests are around MLOps and Contextual Multi-Armed-Bandits these days.\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
