description: "From OSCON 2015 in Portland: The Federal Government’s approach to technology is outdated and maddening. But this dysfunction didn’t come out of thin air—it’s rooted in deep, structural realities. Less than a year old, the U.S. Digital Service is hacking bureaucracy and improving services millions rely on every day. Mikey will talk about how that work is going and how the group is spurring change in the open.\n\nAbout Mikey Dickerson:\nIn 2013, Mikey Dickerson joined what became known as the “ad hoc” team, tasked with rescuing HealthCare.gov after its disastrous launch on October 1. In August 2014, President Obama established the United States Digital Service and tapped Mikey to serve as the Administrator to see if the strategy that succeeded at pulling Healthcare.gov out of the fire could be applied to other government problems.\n\nPrior to his service in government, Mikey worked in Site Reliability Engineering at Google from 2006 to 2014. He took a brief hiatus in 2008 and 2012 to work on the presidential campaigns, and in 2012 helped write software and oversee computer systems for several programs, including the critical “get out the vote” campaign.\n\nWatch more from OSCON 2015: https://goo.gl/vD6vda\nFind out more about OSCON: http://oscon.com/open-source-2015\nDon't miss an upload!
