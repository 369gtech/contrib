Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nService Mesh Architectures Explained - Sidecar and Beyond - Manuel Zapf, Containous \n\nService Meshes are one of the most hyped topics in the containerized world nowadays, as they allow for visibility and management of the traffic that flows inside a Kubernetes cluster, and is just as important, if not more, than ingress traffic which is usually monitored.  Choosing between service meshes is often difficult, as they usually have similar claims. However, the technology and approach used to realize such a service mesh is starting to differ across the different solutions.  The most well known solutions utilize the so-called sidecar pattern to ensure communication across the mesh. However, as of the end of 2019, there are more less invasive approaches.  This talk will provide an overview about the different patterns utilized by different solutions, will highlight its benefits and risks as well as the limits provided by each approach. \n\nhttps://sched.co/abaH"
