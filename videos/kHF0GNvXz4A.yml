description: "Richard Fichtner\nSenior Software Architect\nXDEV Software Corp.\n\nIn agile software development, the focus is on adapting to changing conditions or requirements and optimizing the process continuously. Adaptations and optimizations are driven by the development team itself. To be able to judge the course of an iteration reasonably, metrics are generally used. The main objective of this talk it to propose metrics and appropriate visualizations to answer questions of agile development teams. The metrics provide team members with better access to the metadata of their own work. This is intended to enable the team to better understand their own work and to adapt their processes meaningfully based on the information obtained."
