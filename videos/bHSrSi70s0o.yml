recordingDate: 1387002587
description: "\"Over the last thirty years, computing has had more or less one trajectory: smaller and more powerful. But things are changing - the next tier of devices we need to reach out to are everyday objects in our lives that don't have touch screens, keyboards, or voice input - or sometimes any input at all. In my talk, I'll talk about nitrogen.js, a framework I've been working on to make it easier to build connected devices.\"\n\nTim is an Engineer in Residence with the Microsoft Accelerators in Seattle, Tel Aviv, and Bangalore, where he helps startups use open platforms on the Windows Azure cloud platform. Previously, he was part of Nest Labs, an \"internet of things\" startup focused on building an energy efficient home.  Before coding, he aspires to brew a perfectly brewed cup of coffee. \n\nJSConf.Asia is the JavaScript, web and mobile developer conference for Asia. Hotel H2O and Manila Ocean Park, Philippines - 28 + 29 November 2013.\n\nSource: http://2013.jsconf.asia/blog/2013/10/16/jsconfasia-2013-tim-park-the-rise-of-things\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/TimPark4/the-rise-of-things\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
