description: "Building a Multi-Node SIP Platform Using OpenSIPS Cluster multiple OpenSIPS nodes to create a highly available, multi-node SIP platform\nby Razvan Crainea and Liviu Chircu\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/H.1309/opensips.webm\n\n\nThis talk will present the challenges encountered when building highly available, multi-node SIP platforms and how they are solved using a modern OpenSIPS release. For those aiming to build a high capacity SIP service involving clusterized nodes running in a unified manner, this is a must-attend talk!  During the presentation, we will enumerate the major types of issues that might pop up when architecting multiple SIP proxy instance setups and how OpenSIPS completely shatters them, making the management of such platforms a piece of cake! \n\nRoom: H.1309 (Van Rijn)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 12:45:00+01"
