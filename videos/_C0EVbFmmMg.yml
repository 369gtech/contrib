description: "Join James Penney, CTO, Device Authority, (https://aka.ms/iotshow/deviceauthority) to learn how Device Authorityâ€™s\r KeyScaler platform can be used to securely onboard IoT devices to the IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service in seconds without human intervention. The KeyScaler platform solves one of the biggest challenges of IoT: onboarding of devices at scale and managing the owner-controlled identities and credentials across the different services. Device Authority's KeyScaler platform provides policy-driven automated PKI management for any IoT device to connect it to any Certificate Authority."
