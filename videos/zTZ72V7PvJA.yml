description: "Speaker: Nicky Lim\n\nIn early 2019, I took a class at Cornell University on contributing to Open Source and worked with a team of 6 under the guidance of a WordPress mentor. I will share my experience as a first-time contributor to WordPress: how I familiarized myself with the codebase, got in touch with the WordPress Core (Privacy) and Gutenberg community, and pushed my first few patches out. I hope to entice you into joining this challenging and exhilarating group of WordPress contributors that will allow you to build impactful software and keep your developer’s edge razor sharp.\n\nAbout the speaker\n\nI believe some of the best code ever written is in the Open Source community and it has become a key source of software that runs our digital world today. As such, it is valuable to understand the ecosystem to benefit our own projects and to enable us to contribute back. My Open Source journey started at a college hackathon and I have contributed since then to projects such as WordPress and Hyperledger – a cross-industry blockchain technology hosted by the Linux Foundation. I currently hold a BSc in Computer Engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana—Champaign (UIUC) and MEng in Computer Science from Cornell University.\n\nEvent Page: https://2019.singapore.wordcamp.org/sessions/#wcorg-session-1210\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/qmSn/"
