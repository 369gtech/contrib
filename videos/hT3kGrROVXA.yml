description: "This presentation was recorded at Voxxed Days Belgrade 2016 - https://belgrade.voxxeddays.com/\n\nFirst we started with memcache, the veteran of in-memory NoSQL. Our goal was always auto scaling on AWS and that's when we started using Redis, around 2 years ago, and it has our session, cached items and static data."
