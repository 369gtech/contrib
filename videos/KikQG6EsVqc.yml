description: "Chastity Blackwell, Yelp\n\nDocumentation can often be forgotten when it comes to the pillars of SRE practice; developing tools and new infrastructure has supremacy, and a constant sense of urgency leads to documentation being a \"we'll get around to it later\" task. Even in places where documentation is actually written, it's often done quickly or poorly in the first place, not maintained, or not organized in a way that makes it easy to use. This can impair onboarding, obfuscate problems, and impair incident response.
