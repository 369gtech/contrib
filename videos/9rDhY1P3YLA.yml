description: "I've created a 3 month curriculum to help you go from absolute beginner to proficient in the art of data science! This open source curriculum consists of purely free resources that I’ve compiled from across the Web and has no prerequisites, you don’t even have to have coded before. I’ve designed it for anyone who wants to improve their skills and find paid work ASAP, ether through a full-time position or contract work. You’ll be learning a host of tools like SQL, Python, Hadoop, and even data storytelling, all of which make up the complete data science pipeline.  \n\nCurriculum for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/Learn_Data_Science_in_3_Months\n\nPlease Subscribe!
