description: "PyData London Meetup #54\nTuesday, March 5, 2019\n\nBayesian deep learning has the advantage of incorporating a measure for uncertainty naturally. This is especially in the field of medical image analysis indispensable where human health decisions with potential vast consequences are made on a daily base. Given the ageing population and the scarcity of health service resources, doctors often need to make these decisions without consulting a second opinion. Bayesian deep learning can be this precious second opinion in such decision-making processes by favouring a decision, but also stating how certain the network is about this decision. We discuss three different methods (Bayes by Backprop, Dropout, Flipout) how Bayesian deep learning can be implemented, validate their performances on different medical image data sets, and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each.\n\nSponsored & Hosted by Man AHL\n\n****\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
