description: "Online chat, realtime dashboards, social media sites and even games are just a few examples of where real-time technology can make a huge impact on user experience. ASP.NET Core SignalR is an open-source library that simplifies adding real-time functionality to your applications.\n\nIn this episode, Anthony Chu (@nthonyChu) comes on to talk about how we can get started with ASP.NET Core SignalR. He also shows us how the Azure SignalR Service allows us to easily scale our real-time connections.\n\n01:26 -  What is SignalR?\n02:10 - Why would we want to use SignalR instead of polling?\n03:03 - (Demo) How do we setup SignalR?\n08:48 - What are the scaling options for SignalR?\n12:00 - How does the SignalR service help with scaling?\n13:40- (Demo) How do we add the SignalR Service to an application?\n18:07 - How can other languages or services integrate with Azure Functions?\n19:23 - (Demo) How can we wire up the Azure Functions SignalR Binding?\n25:17 - Where we can learn more and check out the demos?\n\nUseful Links\nIntroduction to ASP.NET Core SignalR: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/signalr/introduction?view=aspnetcore-2.1&WT.mc_id=ondotnet-channel9-cephilli\nWhat is Azure SignalR Service: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-signalr/signalr-overview\nServerless Trivia: https://github.com/anthonychu/serverless-trivia\nCosmosDB Real-time Update demo: https://github.com/anthonychu/cosmosdb-signalr-realtime-updates\nAzure Functions Binding for Azure SignalR Service: https://github.com/anthonychu/AzureAdvocates.WebJobs.Extensions.SignalRService\nCreate a Free Account (Azure): https://aka.ms/azft-net"
