title: 'GopherCon 2021: Mathilde Raynal - Taking the (Quantum) Leap with Go'
language: English
recordingDate: 1639855249
description: "The arrival of quantum computers threatens the security of our online world as we know it, as they enable powerful attacks that break the cryptographic protocols that we use. Fortunately, some alternatives exist that offer resistance against both classical and quantum attacks. We selected Kyber and Dilithium to build a fast and secure library offering implementations in Go of those two post-quantum algorithms. \n\nIn this talk, Mathilde will go through the API; talk about some cool features of our library, for instance, how she enhanced its practical security by deviating from the reference implementations; and finally, discuss its performance and unbox the real costs of deploying post-quantum cryptography."
