recordingDate: 1384533508
description: "http://velocityconf.com\nWebPagetest is an awesome tool, but out of the box there isn't an easy way to run large numbers of tests and get performance trends over time. This demo will show off wpt-script, a tool that Etsy wrote and open sourced to make this process much easier!\n\nJonathan Klein\nEtsy\nJonathan is a software engineer at Etsy that focuses on solving web performance and scalability challenges.
