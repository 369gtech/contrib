description: "Microservices above the Cloud—Designing the International Space Station for Reliability\n\nRobert Barron, IBM\n\nThe International Space Station has been orbiting the Earth for over 20 years. It was not launched fully formed, as a monolith in space. It is built out of dozens of individual modules, each with a dedicated role—life support, engineering, science, commercial applications, and more. Each module (or container) functions as a microservice, adding additional capabilities to the whole. While the modules independently deliver both functional and non-functional capabilities, they were designed, developed, and built by different countries on Earth at different times and once launched into space (deployed in multiple different ways) somehow manage to work together—perfectly.\n\nDespite the many minor reliability issues which have occurred over the decades, the ISS remains a highly reliable platform for cutting-edge scientific and engineering research.\n\nIn this talk, I will describe the way the space station was developed and the lessons SREs can learn from it.\n\nView the full SREcon21 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon21/program"
