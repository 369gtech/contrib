recordingDate: 1574361421
description: 'Location-Based Services (LBS) is one of the cornerstones of a successful mobile application. In recent years, developers have been placing their energies on getting their LBS apps to work indoor. One of the innovative solutions is to use beacons as a way to inform the app whenever it is near to a particular location. In this talk, Wei-Meng will discuss the various beacon technologies available today - Apple’s iBeacon and Google’s Eddystone, and how you can use it in your own applications.'
