description: "Наша группа в ФБ: https://www.facebook.com/dotnetfest/\nНаш сайт: www.dotnetfest.com\n\nДоклад на конференции .NET Fest 2017 в Киеве.\nPremature optimization is the root of all evil, they say. So we end up not doing it at all. In this session, you will learn how to detect early smells for slowness, troubleshoot performance issues in production and under heavy load, on premise and in the cloud. If you wonder whether to use sampling or instrumenting profiler, perf counters or ETW, and to generally approach any performance problem then this session is for you."
