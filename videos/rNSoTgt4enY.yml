title: 'Cloud Native CI/CD with Knative and Tekton Pipelines (A. Frittoli)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1557218499
description: 'Cloud-native developers can enjoy a rich ecosystem, with plenty of functionality already available from existing microservices, a service mesh or the cloud fabric. These benefits come at the cost of added complexity in the development workflow: a could native application is made of a potentially large number of components, and verifying and troubleshooting a small change in one of them might prove challenging. Automation, in the local development environment as well as in the form of continuous integration and delivery pipelines, is fundamental to reduce complexity. In this talk I will introduce Tekton pipelines and Knative; I will present my experience combining the two projects to build cloud-native continuous delivery pipelines. I will discuss the challenges and benefits of using the building blocks of the CD pipeline to implement CI and enhance the development workflow as well.'
