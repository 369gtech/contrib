description: 'Tim Bray is the Developer Advocate, and Breno de Madeiros is the tech lead, in the group at Google that does authentication and authorization APIs; specifically, those involving OAuth and OpenID.  Breno also has his name on the front of a few of the OAuth RFCs.  We''re going to talk for a VERY few (less than 10) minutes on why OAuth is a good idea, and a couple of things we''re working on right now to help do away with passwords. After that, ask us anything.'
