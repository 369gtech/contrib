description: "Slides: http://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/persistence-arrives-on-cloud-foundry\n\nAccess to persistent storage is probably the most requested feature on Cloud Foundry. With persistence storage capabilities new workloads are now possible ranging from efficiently accessing filesystem based services, to scalable deployments of LAMP Stack applications such as Wordpress and Drupal. \n\nAt this session we'll explain how we extended the runtime to include persistence storage, demo pushing and scaling a representative application that accesses data on an NFS volume, such as EMC Isilon and talk about what the future holds for persistence on CF.\n\nSpeaker: Paul Warren, EMC"
