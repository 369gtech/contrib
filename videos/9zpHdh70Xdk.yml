title: 'The Most Average Function There Is - Andrei Alexandrescu'
recordingDate: 1568638659
description: "What makes a programming language desirable for you? There is no right or wrong answer; ten people may have eleven different reasons. And that's brilliant.\nThis talk discusses a few possible takes on the question - things like affiliation to mathematics, intuitive looks, good introspection, and proportional response. Along the way we try to implement literally the most average function there is, and take an irreverent look at how a variety of languages would implement it idiomatically. Don't attend if you're easy to offend. Above all, don't forget: your notion of what makes a language good may be different. And that's brilliant.\n\n\n\nSave the date for NDC TechTown 2020  (31st of August - 3rd of September)\n\nCheck out more of our talks at: \nhttps://ndctechtown.com/\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/"
