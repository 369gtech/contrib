description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nOriginal presentation video in English: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvqZhEd6Txo\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2017\n—\nThe C++ videos can be viewed in multiple languages by an audience a few dozen times broader than today.\nIf you are a speaker and want your videos to be viewed by the whole world but not just by English-speakers then you can facilitate translation by providing original captions and translating to other language you speak.\nIf you regularly analyse C++ videos in details, translate the fragments of it for yourself and would like to benefit the other people's translation then why not sharing the translation with the community? If you want your name to be recognizable you can write your name in the translation you submit.\nIf you are interested in C++ videos with captions/translations then there is a resource that gathers in one place the links to C++ videos in the language of your interest - http://cppvap.wikidot.com/wiki:captions-catalog.\nThis talk tells how you can participate in this initiative and what you can get rfom it.\n— \nRobin Kuzmin: Sr. Software Engineer\nGreater Seattle Area\n\nCrazy about C++, especially behind the compiler curtains, implicit code, standardization. Previously mostly in Hardware Simulation, Firmware Dev in C. Currently in medical devices, embedded Linux, C++. Russian speaker. Co-Founder and Master Admin of cppvap.wikidot.com (C++ Videos Captioning and Translation).\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
