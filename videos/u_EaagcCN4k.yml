description: "Viktor Gamov, Solutions Architect, Confluent\n\nData flows everywhere around us: phones, credit cards, sensor-equipped buildings, trains, buses, planes, and so on. Data collection is not enough anymore. Existing batch systems do data processing via nightly ETL operations, which in enterprise environments require decision-makers to wait an entire day or night for reports to become available. Nobody wants big data anymoreâ€”they want fast data. What distinguishes streaming systems from batch systems is that the events stream is infinite from a system perspective. Decision-makers need to analyze these streaming events as a whole to make business decisions as new information arrives. In this session see conventional data processing architectures and learn how to use open-source tools for stream processing."
