Each of the different TOC members has a unique perspective about Cloud Foundry and we believe that it will be both informative and inspiring for the audience.\r\n\r\nExpect the discussions to revolve around the core ideas that make up the Cloud Foundry technical tooling, specific issues pertaining to setting up, scaling, and securing Cloud Foundry platforms, a focus on how small teams and startups can benefit, and a healthy dose of business benefits organizations could extract when using Cloud Foundry.\r\n\r\nThis is a great opportunity to interact with them and have any queries answered. Post your questions to us via open social media channels (Twitter, LinkedIn, mailing list) and get responses live."
