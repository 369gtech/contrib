description: "Focus is one of the main pillars of accessibility, but it's also an area that many developers are a little fuzzy on.\n\nHere's a good quote from Web AIM to help explain it: \"\"When an item has keyboard 'focus', it can be activated or manipulated with the keyboard.\"\" In other words, if an element is currently focused, and you press a key on your keyboard, that keyboard event will be directed at that element. http://webaim.org/techniques/keyboard/#intro\n\nUsers can change the currently focused element by pressing either the Tab or Shift-Tab keys. The order that elements receive focus is known as the \"\"Tab Order\"\". Making sure you have a consistent, logical tab order is extremely important, especially for users who rely on the keyboard as their primary means of navigating a page.\n\nIn this episode we'll show off what it means for elements to be implicitly focusable, and correct some common mistakes relating to mixed up tab orders.\n\nWatch all A11ycasts episodes: https://goo.gl/06qEUW\n\nSubscribe to the Chrome Developers YouTube channel for updates on new episodes of A11ycasts: http://goo.gl/LLLNvf"
