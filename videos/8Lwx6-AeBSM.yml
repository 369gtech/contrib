title: 'YOW! West 2014 - Seeing Stars: Bespoke AR for Mobiles - David Colls, Nathan Jones, and Brad Ward'
recordingDate: 1422351013
description: "We'll explore the development of the Fireballs in the Sky app, designed for citizen scientists to record sightings of meteorites (\"fireballs\") in the night sky. We'll introduce the maths for AR on a mobile device, using the various sensors, and we'll throw in some celestial mechanics for good measure.\n\nWe'll discuss the prototyping approach in Processing. We'll describe the iOS implementation, including: libraries, performance tuning, and testing. We'll then do the same for the Android implementation. Or maybe the other way around...\n\nReferences: Fireballs in the Sky app (iOS: http://bit.ly/1eZ68BA, Android: http://bit.ly/1eK6X1S).
