title: '#HITB2021AMS D2T2 - Attacking Cloud Native Kubernetes With CDK - Zebin Zhou and Yue Xu'
language: English
recordingDate: 1623368737
description: "Containers offer speed, performance, and portability, but do they actually contain? While they try their best, with the rapid growth of cloud-native containers, several Cloud Service Providers are deploying Kubernetes in production to support customer multitenancy in their Serverless and CaaS offerings. Are they actually contain? Where is the weakness and how to exploit it?\n\nThis talk describes the best practices of our Kubernetes Redteam – the technical details of how to takeover cloud-native k8s cluster step-by-step. We will walk through real cases to show the state-of-the-art k8s attack techniques.\n\nDuring this session we will publish a main release of our open-sourced container penetration tool: CDK. It comes with many powerful PoCs/EXPs and system tools, helps you to escape container and takeover K8s cluster easily. We will demonstrate a full-chain attack with CDK.\n\n=== \n\nZebin Zhou is currently a Tencent Redteam researcher, security engineer of Tencent Security Platform Dpt., member of OpenSEC team, discovered security vulnerabilities in Python-Flask, Chrome and so on. He participated in the research and development of multiple security projects on Github Trending. He focuses on container security and exploitation for years and is one of the most experienced attackers for cloud infrastructure. He published several security research topics in CIS2020、JingQi Con 2019 about container, Kubernetes and servicesmesh.\n\n--- \n\nYue Xu is currently the director of StarCross Technology Portal Lab. His research mainly focuses on container security, incident response, and reverse engineering.\n\nHe has already published several research topics in Black Hat, BlueHat, OWASP, XCon, and PHDays. As a Capture The Flag(CTF) player, he has attended the Defcon Finals three times with the well-known clan ——- r3kapig. Besides, he is also a co-organizer of XCTF."
