This has a few key benefits. First, there are now two repositories on GitHub with adapter source that publishers can use as an additional resource. Second, it allows AdMob to take those adapters up to bintray, where they can be targeted with jCenter packages and CocoaPods. That means that instead of hunting down individual JAR files, publishers can simply add a line to their podfile or build.gradle, and get the adapter they need!\n\nIncluded in this video is a breakdown of the new resources, as well as screencasts of Android Studio and Xcode that show how to import adapters for several networks.\n\nWatch more episodes of Mobile Ads Garage here: https://goo.gl/BDQvw6\n\nSubscribe to the Google Developers channel at http://goo.gl/mQyv5L"
