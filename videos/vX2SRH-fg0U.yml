description: "An average abandonment rate in eCommerce is around 65–68%. Often it’s caused by ambiguous buttons, labels or copywriting as well as severe problems related to finding or understanding products as well as slow and painful checkout experience. We can’t bring the abandonment rate to 0, but we can shave off at least 10% with some minor and straightforward optimizations.\n\nIn this talk, we’ll look into the psychology of eCommerce and common ways to improve conversion, authentication, product listing and filtering, checkout optimizations, payment flows, optimizations for mobile and new opportunities. Let’s get to the bottom of a perfect eCommerce UX: that means removing distractions, minimizing friction and avoiding disruptions and dead ends caused by the interface.\n\nAbout Vitaly: https://twitter.com/smashingmag\n\nMore about CSS Day: https://cssday.nl or https://twitter.com/cssdayconf\nReceive conference announcements in your inbox: https://cssday.nl/subscribe"
