description: "PyData Berlin 2018\n\nDimensionality Reduction methods like PCA - Principal Component Analysis - are widely used in Machine Learning for a variety of tasks. But besides the well-known standard methods there are a lot more tools available, especially in the context of Manifold Learning. We will interactively explore these tools and present applications for Data Visualization and Feature Engineering using scikit-learn.\n\nSlides: \nhttps://de.slideshare.net/StefanKhn4/talk-at-pydata-berlin-about-manifold-learning-and-applications\n\nJupyter-Notebooks:\nhttps://github.com/cc-skuehn/Manifold_Learning\n---\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
