UPnProxyPot was developed to MITM these operators to see what they're doing with their IoT proxy networks and campaigns. We'll cover SSDP, UPnP, UPnProxy research/campaigns as well as cover a new Golang based honeypot, so we can all snoop on them together!\n\nREFERENCES:\nhttp://www.upnp-hacks.org (OG disclosure)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FU6qX0-GHRU (DEF CON 19 talk I attended)\nhttps://www.akamai.com/us/en/multimedia/documents/white-paper/upnproxy-blackhat-proxies-via-nat-injections-white-paper.pdf (my initial UPnProxy research)\nhttps://blogs.akamai.com/sitr/2018/11/upnproxy-eternalsilence.html (additional UPnProxy campaign researcher, also mine)"
