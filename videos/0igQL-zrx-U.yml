description: "Beauty in Code 2020 was a single-track full day IT-conference organized by Living IT, featuring five amazing speakers from three continents. It was hosted at the Malmö Live conference center on March 7, 2020.\n\nhttps://beautyincode.se\nhttps://livingit.se\n\nSession 4 of 6 by Kevlin Henney (https://twitter.com/KevlinHenney)\n\"Lambda? You Keep Using That Letter\"\nLambdas. All the cool kid languages have them. But does ‘lambda’ mean what C#, Java, Python, C++, etc. mean by ‘lambda’? Where did lambdas come from? What were they originally for? What is their relationship to data abstraction?\n\nIn this session we will look into the history, the syntax and the uses of lambdas and the way in which lambda constructs in various languages do (or do not) match the original construct introduced in lambda calculus."
