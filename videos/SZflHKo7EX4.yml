description: "Line-of-Business Apps require relevant organization data and signals from various services. Additionally, users expect user friendly and intelligent solutions, with built-in knowledge about data and processes and allow simple workflows. In this session, we demonstrate how to consume and use business data and how workflows can be delivered with adaptive cards to deliver a smooth user experience with serverless computing. In the second part, we will show practical demos for image recognition and OCR.
