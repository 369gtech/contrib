End users are looking for others in similar situations to share experiences and learn from each other. CNCF helps and supports local organizers through the meetup and ambassador program. In this session, the panelists will share their experiences in building and scaling local communities around the Cloud Native ecosystem. How can you get started? Where do you find speakers and venues? How to keep the momentum? These are just a few of the questions the panelists will try to answer.\n\nhttps://sched.co/aDjR"
