description: "In this live coding session, we'll show Reactor in Action with practical small use cases and recipes (like multibatching, debugging, using reactor-netty as a client, etc.). We'll also show some naive solutions and how to improve on them by using more adapted operators that might have escaped your scrutiny.\n\nSimon Baslé, Staff Software Engineer, Pivotal\nVictor Grazi, VP Core Technologies, Nomura Securities\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2017"
