description: "This course is for absolute beginners and will give you a great kickstart to learning PHP. \nWe'll first talk about what PHP is and why we should learn it, then we will setup a working environment and start coding\n\nThis video covers all the basics:\n\n - How to declare Variables\n - How to work with strings, Arrays\n - How to work with file System\n - How to use cURL to fetch resources\n - Object Oriented PHP\n - Namespaces\n - Composer \n - Autoloading\nand much more...\n\nAt the end of this course we will create a CRUD (CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE) application 3 times. First, we will create it as beginner and see what PHP code looks like without best practices, then we will refactor our application and make it more optimal. We will learn how to use composer, autoloading and we'll create a mini MVC framework with custom routing and then build the final version of our CRUD application using the framework\n\nCode:\nInitial Source files: https://bit.ly/3jmfETf\nFinal Source files: https://bit.ly/3dS9BEx\n\nThe Codeholic YouTube Channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_UMEcP_kF0z4E6KbxCpV1w\n\nOfficial Docs:\nNumbers - https://bit.ly/2IMwiih\nStrings - https://bit.ly/2T3Prht\nArrays - https://bit.ly/2H5NU8i\nFile System - https://bit.ly/3jcjHkE\n\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 - Introduction\n00:02:45 - Course Overview\n00:06:19 - What is PHP and why you should learn it?\n00:09:02 - Setup working environment\n00:22:45 - PHP Syntax\n00:25:50 - Comments\n00:26:58 - Variables\n00:35:45 - Numbers\n00:47:53 - Strings\n01:01:07 - Arrays\n01:14:09 - Associative Arrays\n01:21:44 - Conditionals (If-else, switch)\n01:30:59 - Loops\n01:38:22 - Functions\n01:45:43 - Dates\n01:50:36 - Including files\n01:58:43 - Working with File System\n02:08:01 - OOP\n02:25:46 - cURL\n02:33:53 - Start working on Products CRUD (bad version)\n02:42:05 - Setup connection to database\n02:45:36 - Select & display products from MySql\n02:52:28 - Products CRUD: Creating Product functionality\n02:56:50 - $_GET & $_POST\n03:04:04 - Save data in MySql\n03:13:45 - Form Validation\n03:21:10 - Uploading Image\n03:39:37 - Delete Product\n03:46:01 - Update Product\n03:58:22 - Product Search\n04:02:24 - Improve Products CRUD: Code refactoring\n04:38:30 - Namespaces & Autoloading with composer\n04:49:10 - Install packages using composer\n04:53:10 - MVC Framework with Custom Routing\n04:56:15 - MVC Controllers\n05:13:10 - MVC Views\n05:31:25 - MVC Models\n06:02:13 - Setup Apache Virtual Hosts\n06:11:07 - Sessions\n06:20:55 - Cookies"
