recordingDate: 1433784668
description: "The small-embedded and M2M space is exploding and provides huge opportunities for growth. Currently, the embedded development community is highly fragmented. By using the Java ME 8 platform, the community can rely on Javaâ€™s core values of productivity, consistency, security, portability, a rich feature set, preintegration, and standardization to enable a whole new generation of embedded development. This session reviews the features of the Java ME 8 platform and how it can be used for embedded software development for a wide range of increasingly ubiquitous small embedded devices.\n\n\nAuthors:\nShivakumar Govindarajapuram\ntbd\nView more trainings by Shivakumar Govindarajapuram at https://www.parleys.com/author/shivakumar-govindarajapuram\n\nRobert Clark\nRobert is Sr Director of Software Development for Oracle, where he is responsible for the development of Oracle's Java Platform, Micro Edition (Java ME)--a platform that provides a robust, flexible environment for applications running on mobile and embedded devices.
