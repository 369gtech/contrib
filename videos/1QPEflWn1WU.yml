description: "There’s nothing more frustrating than not being able to deliver new features because of unnecessarily complicated code. You may decide it’s time to throw it all away and start over… and what starts off full of optimism, drags on for months and months, adding even more complexity and various levels of legacy.\n\nIt doesn’t have to be this way! In this presentation, you’ll hear a first-hand experience of how to approach technical debt at its worst, and how a rewrite project was successful in more ways than expected.\n\nThis talk will teach you lessons on how to start, and most importantly, finish a big rewrite project. You will learn how to approach the conversation with the “business”, avoid the most common pitfalls when changing the architecture of a complex codebase, and ensure the rewrite brings value from the start till the very happy end.\n\nAbout Sabrina Leandro\n\nSabrina moved to London from Brazil, and since 2008 has been helping build Songkick, a live music platform for fans and artists.\n\nShe enjoys working in cross-functional teams developing useful and delightful products, while focusing on code quality and good software design practices.\n\nShe’s interested in building quality software and maintaining long-lived and healthy products. Sabrina helped shape the product development process at Songkick and is always looking for new and better ways to work together."
