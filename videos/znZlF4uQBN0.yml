description: "This presentation was recorded at a GOTO Night 2021. #GOTOcon #GOTONight\nhttps://gotopia.tech/meetups\n\nVenkat Subramaniam - Author of \"Programming Kotlin\"\n\nABSTRACT\nAs programmers we crank out code day in and day out. In the pressure to deliver faster and to keep up with change, it's easy to forget about code quality. Over time, we may not even realize how much the code has deteriorated except that we feel the pain moving forward, as with each line of code we touch gets harder and slower to change.\nWe will discuss the reasons to maintain good quality code and ways in which we, each one of us, can be part of creating quality code. [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n02:45 Why should we care about the code quality?\n04:47 First law of programming\n05:07 Economic impact\n05:24 What's quality code?\n06:44 Ways to improve\n06:51 Honor SLAP\n12:05 Favor high cohesion & loose coupling\n14:18 Reveal intention\n17:28 Avoid primitive obsession\n21:12 Avoid clever code\n23:16 Comment \"Why\", not \"What\"\n24:27 Give good meaningful names\n28:44 Do tactical code reviews\n29:47 Outro\n\nRead the full abstract here:\nhttps://www.meetup.com/en-AU/goto-meetups-amsterdam/events/274900040\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nVenkat Subramaniam • Programming Kotlin • https://amzn.to/2MIC8D1\nVenkat Subramaniam• Functional Programming in Java • https://amzn.to/3bzFNNQ\nVenkat Subramaniam • Pragmatic Scala • https://amzn.to/3oIEq35\nVenkat Subramaniam • Test-Driving JavaScript Applications • https://amzn.to/3i9CbmW\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#Programming #CodeQuality #QualityAssurance #Quality #QA\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
