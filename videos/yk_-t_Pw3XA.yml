description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM STO 19 http://bit.ly/2W2vgDC\n\nGet involved in Code Sync's next conference http://bit.ly/2Mcm4aS\n\n---\n\nJUST DELETE IT\nby Johnny Winn\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nIsolation \nDesign \nPatterns\n\nTALK LEVEL: Intermediate \n\nABSTRACT\nAre we creating big balls of mud within our applications? Is an abstraction necessary or is it going to couple the code to the implementation? Can I achieve code isolation without overcomplicating? The challenge is to reach the nirvana of simple code isolation verse complex code abstraction. But is it realistically obtainable? The challenge is set: implement patterns that will allow us to just delete & rewrite code in days instead of weeks, weeks instead of months, and months instead of ... version 2.\n\nRead the full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/johnny-winn/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - JOHNNY WINN\nHost of the Elixir Fountain\n\nThe renaissance man from Jacksonville, Johnny embarked on his computing curiosity during the eighties on a Commodore 64. However the road leading toward software craftsmanship has diverged down many paths. From musician to electrical engineer, chef to software developer, rugby player to local politician, the twist and turns have provided a wide range of experiences that have helped to shape him.\n\nMore on Johnny Winn: https://codesync.global/speaker/johnny-winn/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM STO 19\nCode BEAM STO is powered by Code Sync.
