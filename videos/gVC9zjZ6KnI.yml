title: 'DEF CON 29 Voting Village - Barb Byrum - Hack the Conspiracies'
language: English
recordingDate: 1632350796
description: "The conspiracy theories surrounding the November 2020 General Election have had a profound and significant impact on the American people but the devastating damage done to the integrity of our elections will take years to repair. This has resulted in death threats, attacks, and shows of force against our election workers, armed protests that turned violent and legislation that would take states backward to a time when America more blatantly disenfranchised certain groups and demographics of voters. The result is that many qualified election administrators are leaving the profession for positions where their lives are not in danger.\n\nWe must fight back against disinformation and the misinformation relating to our elections and those that would seek to speak fear and lies. We must pledge to push back on those lies and that disinformation in the media and online at every opportunity. We must work together on our elections to make sure that they are safe and secure as they can possibly be. Together, we can hack the conspiracies and take back our democracy."
