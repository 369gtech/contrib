description: "Building for mobile web requires a different mindset than desktop web development, and a different set of tools.  The tools we're used to using often aren't available or would take up too much screen real estate.  And going back to the dark ages of tweak/save/deploy/test/repeat isn't exactly optimal, so what can we do?  Thankfully there are a number of great options - from remote debugging to emulation, mobile browsers are offering more and more tools to make our lives easier.\n\nWe'll take a look at a couple of tools that you can use today to make cross platform mobile web development easier and then peer into the crystal ball to see what tools may bring in the future.\n\nJoin us for Part 1 - as we take a look at a few boiler plates, frameworks and helpful libraries for building the mobile web."
