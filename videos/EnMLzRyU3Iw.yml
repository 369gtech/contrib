description: "Recorded at SpringOne Platform 2016.\nSpeaker: Tomas Lin, Netflix\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/putting-a-spel-on-spinnaker-evolving-an-expression-language-for-continuous-delivery-at-netflix\n\nSpinnaker is an open source, multi-cloud continuous delivery platform. It is used by over 90% of cloud deployments at Netflix. The Spring Expression Language (SpEL) is heavily leveraged to fully articulate and extend Spinnaker’s automated deployment pipelines. SpEL is used heavily to interact with pipeline stages and triggers for variable substitution, information retrieval and conditional evaluation. This session will walk through the evolution of Spinnaker’s use of SpEL over two years of active development. We will share the code, features and wisdom gained from helping the Netflix and open source community adopt SpEL. You should attend if you are interested in the Spinnaker platform and the continuous delivery pipelines feature, or wish to learn how to fully harness SpEL for your own tools."
