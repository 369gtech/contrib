description: "Master all the freshest Angular skills with on-demand workshops with industry leading pros: https://ngconf-school.teachable.com/\n\nIn this workshop Tara Z. Manicsic will walk you through multiple ways of rendering content, focusing on two approaches: Server Side Rendering (SSR) and the Jamstack architecture approach. You’ll look into the Angular approach to SSR using Angular Universal. Then you’ll compare that process to the Jamstack approach of utilizing serverless functions.\n\nWe’ll also be shining light on the other surrounding concerns like set up, costs, developer experience, and more. The point of this workshop is not to tell you which approach is the best, but to give you the information to make that decision on your own.\n\nng-conf is the premier global conference for the Angular JavaScript framework, offering both in-person and online events throughout the year. Focused on delivering the highest quality training, ng-conf is where careers are made.\n\nng-conf: Hardwired is brought to you by:\n- https://thinkster.io/ The best Angular and JavaScript tutorials on the web\n- https://herodevs.com/ Engineering and consulting by web development experts\n- https://xlts.dev/  Extended support for AngularJS\n\nFollow us on twitter https://twitter.com/ngconf\nOfficial Website: https://www.ng-conf.org/"
