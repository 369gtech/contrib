description: "Power-line communication (PLC) carries data on a electric line is used for AC electric power transmission or electric power distribution to consumers. PLC systems are based on the idea of ​​networking without the need for new cables. PLC in smart grids is used extensively in smart meters. Thus, plugs could become an input point due to the data transmission on the power line and from an attacker’s perspective, the PLC could become an new attack surface in smart grids.\n\nIn this talk I will explain a red team approach of smart meters in smart grids. These smart meters work on PLC. I will explain a case for how to capture data on 220v power line and how to retransmission of data on power line. Also I will discuss various attack vectors on smart grids such as blackout of transformer, manipulating usage data and analyze how to mitigate them. I will use some old school mathematical calculation for demodulation signals and data extraction on power line theoretically.\n\n=== \n\nFatih is a cyber security professional who works as penetration tester and IoT(Internet of things) cyber security services team leader at Biznet Bilisim. Currently he focus on embedded devices security, network security and application security to build a resilient world against cyber threats. He performed various IoT pentest project such as smart meters&grids, customer devices, RFID & NFC card systems. He is, as one of the volunteer and coordinator, organizing Turkey’s first ICS & IoT security student bootcamp for 2 years. This year Fatih carried out bootcamp at 19-22 June at Turkey."
