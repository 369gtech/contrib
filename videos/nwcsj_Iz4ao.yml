description: "Google Tech Talks\nJune,  4 2008\n\nABSTRACT\n\nStory Driven Modeling (SDM) is a systematic software development approach based on scencario analysis on model level. Usual text book approaches start with the derivation of a domain level class diagram from textual requirements specifications. This does not work. Class diagrams structure programs not your domain. Thus SDM proposes to analyse requirements with the help of usage scenarios. These scenarios are elaborated into a flip book of object diagrams that models how the runtime data of the desired application shall be organized. The Fujaba UML tool supports the modeling with such story boards and as a result it generates automatic JUnit tests that setup the modeled scenario, invoke the described functionality and compare the resulting object structure with the object diagram modeled in the initial scenario. The talk will present this approach with a live demo of the approach on a simple example.\n\n\nSpeaker: Albert Zundorf"
