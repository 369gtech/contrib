Oslo is a thousand years old, yet thoroughly modern with world class municipal services. Over time, clutter had built up in the city’s identity, and about 250 logos were in use. As a result, Oslo’s residents didn’t recognize much of the good work that their government actually did.\n\nSo, we worked with the city to clarify its identity. We made a new logo, by simplifying the city’s seal; and a flexible system inspired by shapes from Oslo’s streetscapes and architectural details. Infinitely reconfigurable, the shapes can also spell “Oslo” as a word picture. Our new custom typeface, Oslo Sans, inspired by generations of city street signs, supports universal design requirements.\n\n - Captured Live on Ustream at https://www.ustream.tv/amuse"
