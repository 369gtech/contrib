title: 'Cats, The Musical! Algorithmic Song Meow-ification - Beth Haubert'
language: English
recordingDate: 1538644371
description: "How are we supposed to sing along with our favorite TV theme song every week if it doesn’t have lyrics?\n\nAt Beth's house, they “meow” along (loudly). They also code, so she built ‘Meowifier’ to convert any song into cat meows. Meowifier is a technical feat. It’s hilarious. It’s beautiful. It’s a new way to waste time on the internet.\n\nJoin her in this exploration of technical problem solving & gratuitous cat gifs. This talk is the story of how a silly idea morphed into one technical challenge after another, focusing on three aspects of the build that we might be surprised to learn were unique challenges."
