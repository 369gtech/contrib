title: '#SON12: Celine Schmahl et. al. - Collaborative consumption'
recordingDate: 1582443901
description: "Collaborative consumption is a fairly new term coined by author Rachel Botsman. It describes a shift away from ownership towards emphasizing access. It includes new business models such as car-sharing, sharing of apartments, experiences and skills, just to name some examples. Essentially, collaborative consumption is about sharing and being open; the user opens up a part of his life, resources and belongings to others in a way that benefits both parties and society as a whole.\n\nSummit of Newthinking, 15. bis 16.
