title: 'GeeCON 2018: Julian Warszawski - Models vs Reality: Quest for the Roots of Complexity'
recordingDate: 1532331015
description: 'In this talk we will get familiar with the concept of Model Dependent Realism, coined by Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow. We will then apply it to reason about Software Development as operating hierarchy of languages and abstractions. Equipped with the new mental model, we will try to disect and understand the phenomenon of complexity - concept so ill-defined and misused that it has grown an aura of mysticism around. Lots of engineering energy is wasted to dealing with consequences of complexity rather than addressing the fundamental cause. This is going to change NOW.'
