description: "Google Tech Talks\nNovember 8, 2006\n\nABSTRACT\nThe World Energy Council has estimated the 'useful' global ocean wave energy resource as 2TW (17,500TWh/year). From this it has been estimated (Thorpe 1999) that the practical economic contribution from wave energy converters could be 2,000TWh/year (similar to current installed nuclear or hydroelectric generation capacity). Such generating capacity could result in up to 2 billion tonnes of CO2 emissions being displaced from fossil fuel generation per year - similar to current emissions from electricity generation in the US.\n\nFormed in 1998, based in Edinburgh, Scotland, Ocean Power Delivery Ltd has developed the 'Pelamis' wave energy converter..."
