description: "RubyConf 2018 - Empowering Early-Career Developers by Mercedes Bernard\n\nHow can teams invest in and grow their less experienced developers into team-leading senior devs? I believe the first step is empowering them. On my team, we’ve created a process for each team member to lead and own one of our core features. Our early-career developers are learning client management and team leadership skills that they wouldn’t usually get to practice until they stepped into a senior role. In this talk, I’ll share our process and what we’ve learned so you can give your early-career developers valuable experience they need to become successful, senior team members."
