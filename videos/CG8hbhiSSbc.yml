description: "Browsers have had an input element since the dawn of time, and yet any time you talk to web developers about it, everyone complains about it. It's unpredictable. It's grumpy. It's got reaaaaally strong opinions about style, and it doesn't want to listen to yours. I'm going to tell you a story about how input grew up to be the moody adult it is, and why it's maybe time we stood up to it.\n\nSlides: https://speakerdeck.com/notwaldorf/input-i-you-but-youre-bringing-me-down\nAbout Monica: http://meowni.ca\n\nMore about CSS Day: http://cssday.nl or https://twitter.com/cssdayconf\nReceive conference announcements in your inbox: http://cssday.nl/subscribe"
