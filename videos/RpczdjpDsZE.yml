title: '"Easy Geo-Redundant Handover + Failover with MARS + systemd" - Thomas Schoebel-Theuer (LCA 2020)'
recordingDate: 1578986956
description: "Thomas Schoebel-Theuer\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/114/\n\nThe talk describes a simple setup of long-distance replication with minimum effort. The new systemd interface of MARS will drastically reduce your effort to make your existing complex solution geo-redundant.\r\n\r\nGeo-redundancy / mass data replication over long distances is now much easier to manage for sysadmins. Although systemd has some shortcomings and earns some criticism, it can ease your automation of handover / failover when combined with the new unit-file template generator from the long-distance data replication component MARS. It is very flexible, supporting arbitrary application stacks, e.g. virtual machines, containers, and much more.\r\nMARS is used by 1&1 IONOS for geo-redundancy of thousands of LXC containers, and on several petabytes of data, with very low cost.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
