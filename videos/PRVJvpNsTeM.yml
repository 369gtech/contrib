description: "In this webinar, Polyverse CEO Alex Gounares will explain how Moving Target Defense can be applied to make container environments impenetrable. \n\nStatic environments are easy to attack as hackers have time to study a system and identify its vulnerabilities. The challenge is homogeneity: applications use exactly the same software available to attackers, be it Linux, Windows, or the numerous application stacks like Java. Attackers can analyse and craft attacks at leisure, knowing that successful exploits can often be used against millions of computers— “break once, run anywhere”.\n\nCurrently, security teams try to defend static infrastructure by trying to predict, detect, analyse, investigate and remedy attacks. This is expensive, time consuming, unwieldy and, moreover, ineffective.\n\nMoving target defense continuously changes the attack surface so hackers do not get a chance to decipher the environment and therefore cannot launch an attack. Alex will explain how applying dynamic diversity through code scrambling and container cycling provides intrinsic protection for container environments. \n\nWhat will you learn?\n-   How hackers craft attacks by using your own code to attack your systems \n- Get an overview of the philosophy of Moving Target Defense \n- How to build Defense in Depth for container environments\n\nWEBINAR LIVE DATE: Thursday 29 June 2017 | 16:30 BST / 11:30 EDT / 08:30 PDT\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nSPEAKER CONTACT DETAILS\n\nALEX GOUNARES  - Founder and CEO of Polyverse Corporation, a cyber security company focused on protecting data center applications from large scale data breaches and disruption.
