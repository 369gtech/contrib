description: "Panel Discussion: Cloud Foundry Test Kitchen - Bernd Krannich, SAP SE; Cornelia Davis, Pivotal; Simon Moser, IBM; Jeff Hobbs, SUSE and Moderated by Swarna Podila, Cloud Foundry Foundation \n\nThe integration of Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes was a major, recurring topic at each of the last few CF summits. Earlier panel discussions created quite some interest: “Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes - Will it blend?” (http://sched.co/DdZr, https://youtu.be/4ow7IumxkOM), \"Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes - Did it blend?\" (https://sched.co/FRyD, https://youtu.be/QkQe3354Y6Q) and \"Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes - The blending continues\" (https://sched.co/KJCZ, https://youtu.be/WWidgdvzjOI)  It turned out that new technology components for Cloud Foundry not only come from the Kubernetes ecosystem. In a sequel to the panel discussions, representatives of major companies in the CF ecosystem will reconvene to assess the status of the evolution of Cloud Foundry, the progress that has been made since the last summit, and provide updates to the visions the companies have for the future of Cloud Foundry. \n\nFor more info: https://www.cloudfoundry.org/"
