title: 'Reactive web services by Kamil Szymanski'
recordingDate: 1519313108
description: "Ahh, reactive, probably the buzzword of 2017, newer and shinier than good ol' microservices, all asynchronous, non-blocking and I've even heard some event-driven buzz around it. During this live-coding session we won't focus on the shiny nor on saving the world with dataflows using composable operators. Instead we'll focus on how the execution of this reactive approach differs from 'classic imperative approaches' and check how it impacts resource consumption. We'll also see backpressure in action, cover the topic of data marshalling and talk about event loops.\n\nKamil Szymanski, Pragmatic Coders\nSoftware developer, JVM & open-source enthusiast, develops D2C investment platform @ Pragmatic Coders, helps organizations improve software delivery processes @ OSEC\n\nRecorded at Jfokus 2018\nhttps://www.jfokus.se/jfokus18/schedule.jsp"
