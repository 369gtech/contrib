description: "Ближайшая конференция — Mobius 2020 Piter\n22-25 июня, Online\nПодробности и билеты: https://bit.ly/mobius2020piter\n\n. Android Team did a lot of work in improving the compile, build and runtime: from Dalvik to ART, from Java & Dex Compiler to D8, from Proguard to R8, from JIT compiler to AOT compiler. With all those changes it could be confusing and hard to follow on what is actually happens and what and how works under the hood.\n\nAt this talk, we will go over all compilation and building process: D8 & R8, we will learn what is Virtual Machine and how ART is different from Dalvik, what is JIT and how AOT replace it and how the modern project put all this together."
