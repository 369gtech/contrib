description: "On this episode, Join Dr G and Pablo Veramendi, Director of Microsoft's global Student Developer programs, as they explore the benefits and challenges of participating in hackathons, especially when you’re early in your coding journey. Then, jump into a hands on walk through of Azure Custom Vision, one of the many Learn modules to inspire participation in the global Imagine Cup 2021 competition. Learn more about the Imagine Cup competition at https://aka.ms/LearnWithDrG/ImagineCup And check out the module we explore at https://aka.ms/LearnWithDrG/IntelligentBots\n\nLearning to code is full of AHA moments, failing forward, clarity, confusion, and everything in between. And learning how data plays a role is the code we write adds another layer of excitement. Sarah (Dr. G) has dedicated her professional career to not only learning new things, but also learning how people learn new things. While earning her PhD in computer science, she focused on building curriculum and tools to help novices of all ages take their first steps on their personal coding journey. Along the way, she’s taught thousands of children, career changers, teachers, and university professors how to code, and more importantly, about the two most important pieces to success: perseverance and community. Join Dr. G on our collaborative journey through code, data science, and machine learning and become a part of that community! With the power of Visual Studio Code, Azure, and some creative fun you can test your own persistence, learn something new, and likely teach something too!"
