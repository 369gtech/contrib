recordingDate: 1416382309
description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2014\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nMartin Fowler - Author, speaker, consultant and general loud-mouth on software development\nKatherine Kirk - Independent Consultant & Researcher\nJez Humble - Author of \"Continuous Delivery\", Principal Consultant, ThoughtWorks\nPragmatic Dave Thomas - Pragmatic Programmer turned Publisher\nTatiana Badiceanu - IT Consultant at the LEGO Group\n\nABSTRACT\nThe Agile Manifesto was the spark that brought about a shift in how software was being developed and as a result a wave of new Agile Methodologies such as SCRUM, XP, and Continuous Delivery have been introduced as  “better ways of developing software”.  Many development organizations have adopted these agile methodologies to improve their communication, increase customer involvement, and create happier and more efficient software teams.  \n\nFast forward to today, 13 years later, a discussion has emerged on what has happened since the Agile Manifesto was first published.  Prag Dave Thomas, one of the original 17 authors,  has written a blog post which has been heavily discussed online and on twitter titled \"Agile is Dead (Long Live Agility) where he points out that the term \"Agile\" has become a marketing buzzword for companies and consultants to use as a way to commercialize the ideas behind Agile Software Development.  He also goes on to suggest that developers should program with “agility” rather then hoping solutions that are simply \"coined\" as  \"Agile\" will be able to solve some of the difficult problems that they encounter when developing software.\n\nAt GOTO, we think it is time to take a closer look at what has happened in the last 13 years since the Agile Manifesto was published and evaluate where the development community is going in the future.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
