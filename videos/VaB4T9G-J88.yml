description: "Java 8 provides us with new APIs to support a functional programming style. While the standard provides us with a good basis, we sometimes wish for even shorter or powerful ways to write clean code for complex tasks.\n\nIn this talk I will show you some additional libraries for Java 8 (and beyond) which give you this little extras here and there. I will cover a wide variety of use cases like filter/map/reduce, stream API add-ons, lambdas with unit testing, SQL query support.\n\nThis will cover among others: Vavr (Javaslang), JUnit 5, jOOL, RxJava, Vert.x, Jinq\n\nKey takeaways\nYou will see libraries which extend streams with more methods\nWhat can you do with a pure functional library like Vavr/Javaslang\nHow to write unit tests with lambas in JUnit 5\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
