recordingDate: 1487929928
description: "We ask our users to give us a lot of personal data in order to provide rich experiences. People are complex and it is very easy to make assumptions about the most basic questions.\nThis talk will look at how to ask people about data in a way that is inclusive, helpful while still providing value. Using gender as an example, we will learn what the stress cases are and what other things we need to consider when we ask our users to trust us with their identity."
