Have you ever seen an application be throttled even though itâ€™s no where near its CPU limit?    Up till now, the answer has always been simply turn off hard-limits, but that has potentially nasty performance implications in shared environments. Now there's another option! This session will explain the real root cause of what has been happening. We'll introduce the kernel mechanisms that Kubernetes and other Container Orchestrators rely on to enforce CPU limits. We'll then show how they were broken, how we fixed them, and what those changes mean for you and your clouds.    By the end of this session you'll understand exactly what you are getting when you set the CPU limits on your pods. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Uae1"
