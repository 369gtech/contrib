title: 'microXchg 2017 - Uwe Friedrichsen: Resilient functional service design'
language: English
recordingDate: 1487259459
description: "With the rise of cloud, microservices and alike, we talk a lot about resilience as we need it to create robust distributed systems.\n\nUnfortunately, we usually only talk about the technical aspects - patterns, technologies, libraries and more. While these are important ingredients in resilient software design, they are worthless without a corresponding functional service design.\n\nA very simple example: If service A always needs input from service B to do something useful, service A can never become robust with respect to failures of service B, no matter how much effort you put in technical robustness measures.\n\nIn this session we will explore, how much functional design affects the overall robustness of a solution (spoiler: a lot!) and learn how to deliver a better \"resilient functional service designâ€œ."
