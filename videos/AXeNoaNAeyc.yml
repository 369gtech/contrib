description: "A lot has been said about malware and security in industrial automation systems after Stuxnet. This session focuses on security scenarios in automation and process control, discusses current challenges, and provides specifics of a Java-based solution for mitigating industrial data security issues. It describes attributes of small-form-factor devices, with a focus on security, tampering possibilities, and risk mitigation methods. It explores security aimed at protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of networked systems from being compromised through deliberate or accidental attacks. It also evaluates an edge-to-enterprise-type Java security architecture for transforming shop floor data into actionable intelligence and analytics.\n\n\nAuthors:\nRanbir Mazumdar\nI am a Principal Sales Consultant working for Oracle based in Chicago, IL.
