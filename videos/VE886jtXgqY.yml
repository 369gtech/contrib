description: "With Test::Class::Moose you write test code in the form of object-oriented classes, where each method is essentially a subtest. This makes organizing tests across a large code base easier, and in particular makes sharing various bits of test code simpler. Test::Class::Moose also provides features for parallel testing, grouping tests with tags, reporting, and more.\n\nThis talk will cover the basic features of Test::Class::Moose, including example code and tips for organizing your test code.\n\nSlides are at https://www.houseabsolute.com/presentations/github/test-class-moose/#/"
