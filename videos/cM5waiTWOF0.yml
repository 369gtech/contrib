title: 'How to Conduct a Technical Interview'
recordingDate: 1495136163
description: "Given all the discussion on this topic both locally and nationally, perhaps it's a good time to talk about Technical Interviews from the side of the Interviewer.  Discussions of both good and bad practices, how you can really find the right person without resorting to anti-pattern behavior (like inverting a binary tree on a whiteboard), and what you are really looking to find out will all be addressed.\n\nCome and learn, or come and share what you know.  Or maybe, do a little of both. \n\nPresented by Richard Ashkettle\n\nSlide Link\n\nhttp://bit.ly/2rgBlgx"
