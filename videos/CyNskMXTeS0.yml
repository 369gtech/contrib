description: "Visit the largest developers congress in Europe: WeAreDevelopers World Congress, 16 - 18 May 2018 in Vienna, Austria.\n\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/congress/\n\nVirtual Reality is the next big thing in building realistic applications, games, communication tools, and entertainment experiences. A-Frame is a web-based VR framework used to create wonderful VR Scenes and VR applications. With a-frame, you can run your VR applications using your browser on any VR devices, including Oculus rift, Cardboard, Procus pro, etc. This talk will enable the participants to get started with Virtual Reality and a-frame, developing VR applications and ultimately create their own Pokemon World in Virtual Reality. Any person with knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript can easily start creating their own VR applications. We will also go through a few web-based VR projects like a-frame painter, 360-degree photo albums, and 3D gallery. By the end of this session, the participant will have a complete understanding of what webVR is, practical knowledge on how to build VR applications, popular webVR projects, and finally be able to build their own Pokemon world in VR.\n\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/wearedevelopers.org/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/wearedevs/\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/wearedevelopers.org/"
