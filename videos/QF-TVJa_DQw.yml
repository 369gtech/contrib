description: "Building enterprise applications with the Spring Framework has been more or less the industry standard for several years. The introduction of Java EE 6 made it easier to develop enterprise applications based on standards without the need to rely on proprietary frameworks. With Java EE 7, this becomes even more evident. This session highlights the advantages of using a standards-based approach and demonstrates, step by step, the migration of an existing application based on the Spring Framework to a full-fledged Java EE 7 application.\n\n\nAuthor:\nIvar Grimstad\nIvar Grimstad is an experienced software architect with a strong focus on Enterprise Java. \n\nHe has been working with Java since the beginning and has over the years tried out everything from lightweight mobile applications to large scale enterprise applications. His experience covers all aspects of designing architectures based on a variety of technologies including standard Java EE as well as more lightweight frameworks such as Spring and a variety of open source products.\n\nGrimstad is always focusing on quality and on using the right tools and technologies for the right task to optimize the software development process.\n\nIn addition to being active in the local Java Community, Grimstad has been speaking at several conferences and gatherings in the Nordics.\nView more trainings by Ivar Grimstad at https://www.parleys.com/author/ivar-grimstad\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
