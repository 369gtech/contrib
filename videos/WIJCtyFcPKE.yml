description: "You have a really cool and impactful project, but as soon as your codebase gets bigger, and more and more contributors come into play, things can become challenging in regards to aspects like: code consistency, technical debt, refactoring, application architecture and team organization. Letâ€™s jump onboard on this journey and walk through different techniques that can help us keep our code sane and healthy for better scalability. Disclaimer: This talk is going to be focused from a mobile standpoint but most of the practices included can also be applied to any software project under development.\n\nMore information about awesome conference: https://devfest.gdg.lv"
