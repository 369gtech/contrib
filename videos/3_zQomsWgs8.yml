recordingDate: 1449753647
description: "Thomas Grip, the creative director at Frictional Games, will talk about some of his recent thinkings in game design. He will first present a framework that splits up a game's design into a system, story and mental model part and explain how it all fits together. This framework will then be used to dive deeper into design issues such as \"how to create better storytelling\" and \"why planning is probably the most important aspect of gameplay\". Thomas might also rant a lot about Super Mario.\n\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry in the Malmö/Lund region. Foo Café is aimed at those interested in sharing, learning and creating. \nJoin the fun at foocafe.org"
