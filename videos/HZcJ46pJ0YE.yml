title: 'Moving Fastify to Azure Pipelines - BDL2059'
recordingDate: 1557360084
description: "Fastify is a popular Node.js framework for building web applications, designed to be fast. It's open source and released on GitHub. Fastify has adopted Azure Pipelines for their Continuous Integration, which makes it easier for the project to run tests on each Pull Request, and simplifies the life of the (busy!) maintainers.\_\r\n\r\nIn this brief live session, Damian will interview Matteo Collina, maintainer of Fastify and core developer of Node.js, about his experience on using Azure Pipelines for an open source project on GitHub."
