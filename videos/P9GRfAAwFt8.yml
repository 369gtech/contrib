recordingDate: 1615559565
description: "The React Native team announced a lot of changes to the core of React Native that address a lot of challenges that developers were facing when building apps. The changes include:\n\n- Turbo Modules - the new implementation of native modules created for better performance and synchronous access,\n- CodeGen - to ease the creation of native modules by synchronizing the typed definitions,\n- JSI - JavaScript Interface,\n- Fabric - UI re-architecture.\n\nIn this part of The React Native Show podcast, our host, Mike Grabowski, and his guests:\n\nMonica Restrepo – Software Engineer at Major League Soccer\nKudo Chien – Software Engineer at CloudMosa\nEloy Duran – Principal Software Engineer at Microsoft\nRam N – an Engineering Manager at Oculus\n\ndiscuss the details of the upcoming re-architecture of React Native.\n\nIn this video you’ll hear about:\n- What is the status of the re-architecture? What changes are already shipped and when do we expect to have an update on the rest of them?\n- Where can we track the updates on the re-architecture?\n- Can we expect a smooth transition path between the current and, let’s say, the “new” React Native?\n- One of the latest and greatest features that are currently running on Android in production is Hermes – a JS engine. What are the biggest differences from the V8 JavaScript engine and why was there a decision to essentially write something from the ground up?\n\nThis video is a part of The React Native Show Podcast Ep 2: \"React Native EU 2020 Conference Q&A Panel\" \nWatch the full episode here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHSe66Dhs7M"
