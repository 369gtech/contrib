Weâ€™ll start by learning the basics and perfect your knowledge of Machine Learning and TensorFlow.js by building a digit classifier. Then, weâ€™ll develop our expertise in core TensorFlow.js concepts and Reinforcement Learning(RL) and develop a self-driving car that learns how to drive itself. Weâ€™ll finish off by adding a touch of the magic of neural networks to our Angular application by building an image classifier. (all demos made with ðŸ’– using Angular 9+)\n\nWatch all the ng-conf: Hardwired presentations/videos at https://videos.ng-conf.org\n\nng-conf is a three-day Angular conference focused on delivering the highest quality training in the Angular JavaScript framework. 1500+ developers from across the globe converge on Salt Lake City, UT every year to attend talks and workshops by the Angular team and community experts.\n\nng-conf: Hardwired is brought to you by:\n- https://thinkster.io/ The best Angular and JavaScript tutorials on the web\n- https://herodevs.com/ Engineering and consulting by web development experts\n- https://xlts.dev/  Extended support for AngularJS\n\nFollow us on twitter https://twitter.com/ngconf\nOfficial Website: https://www.ng-conf.org/"
