description: "Was 2020 not the best year for you? Has 2021 not been a huge improvement? Are you sick of being dependent on infrastructure which fails? Do you wish there was something to look forward to? The Four Thieves Vinegar Collective has been quiet, because we've been busy this last year. We have a lot of things to share.\n\nBut that's not what this talk is about. Instead of the new tools to eradicate diseases, tools to make medicines, ways to administer them, and DIY medical machinery, we're talking about just making it through the day. \n\nThere are tools which are not well known, but are easily accessible and can help you sleep better, not be hungover, clear brain fog, and take the edge off depression. These tools are not as well known as they should be, so we're talking about them. \n\n Because as fun as the big things are, daily life is about the little things."
