description: "Making the Middle Great Again\n\nPauly Comtois, VP DevOps, Hearst\n\nAfter gaining support from leadership and the engineers in the trenches, my initial success began to falter. After meeting with each business unit it became clear that middle management was not incentivized or driven to adopt a DevOps culture. My new focus became understanding the incentives, drivers and fears at the middle management level and addressing the factors that were blockers to DevOps success.\n\nDOES16 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
