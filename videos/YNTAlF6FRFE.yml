description: "In 2015 Java celebrates 20 years as a generally available programming language and platform. This session will cover some of the highlights, challenges, and insights gleaned of Java’s rise from newcomer to solid performer. We’ll take a look at where the technology is today, and peek into the crystal ball to explore some interesting directions that the technology may take us over the next 20 years.\n\nGeorges Saab is responsible for Java Standard Edition (SE) including the Java language, core libraries, and the Java Virtual Machine. A veteran of programming language and platform development for more than 25 years, his work with the Java platform began as a developer of Java SE at JavaSoft and Sun Microsystems, where he was a founder of the Swing group and Java Webstart. He also ran development of the JRockit JVM for many years at BEA Systems. Georges is also the Chairperson of the OpenJDK governing board.\n\nFor more on YOW!
