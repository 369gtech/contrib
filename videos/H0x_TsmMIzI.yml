title: 'Tanzu TV - Between Chair and Keyboard - The one with Aino Corry'
language: English
recordingDate: 1617661486
description: 'Please join Nate Schutta and Aino Corry. After gaining her Ph.D. in Computer Science in 2001 Aino Vonge Corry spent the next 10 years failing to choose between being a researcher/teacher in academia, and being a teacher/facilitator in industry. She eventually squared the circle by starting her own company, Metadeveloper, which develops developers by teaching CS, teaching how to teach CS, inviting speakers to IT conferences, and facilitating software development in various ways. She has facilitated retrospectives and other meetings for the past 15 years during which time she has made all the mistakes possible in that field.'
