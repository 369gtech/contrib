title: 'The Ultimate e-Meetup | J.B Rainsberger - Breaking Through Your Refactoring Rut'
language: English
recordingDate: 1592917655
description: "In 2020 we have been participating in a global, uncontrolled experiment in working without our employers consistently monitoring our actions. Some people have been suddenly given the opportunity to take more risks and change how they do their work. I strongly recommend that you take this opportunity to engage in more deliberate practice! I notice one area where many programmers do not progress because they feel constant pressure not to slow down: the refactoring part of evolutionary design.\n\nI'd like to emphasize the value and importance of practicing refactoring deliberately, describing in some detail why it matters, how you could benefit, and why it might be easier now for you to get started. Ultimately, I'd like to help you feel more confident that it would indeed be a wise investment of your time, energy, and money."
