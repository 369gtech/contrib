description: "Chris Scott proposes that it makes you a better programmer to learn new programming languages -- even if you never use those new languages in production. This will be a general talk on programming languages, including Java, C#,  Perl, C, Scala, Node.js and more. Target audience is programmers who are already proficient in one language, no matter what that language would be.\n\nPresented live on Nov 15, 2016 at Code & Supply in Pittsburgh, PA.
