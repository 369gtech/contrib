language: English
recordingDate: 1563562530
description: "Helen Zhang, Google\n\nWe built a unified reporting system to bring together data from different sources that lived in unconnected silos (such as SLO reporting metrics, postmortems, incident response tools, customer support tickets, etc.). The system ingests and correlates data from these different sources and stores the processed data in a new database. People from a variety of teams would use the data to create customized dashboards that suit their particular reporting needs.\n\nView the full SREcon19 Asia/Pacific program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon19asia/program\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
