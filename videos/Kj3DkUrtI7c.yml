title: 'JeremyBytes - C# Generics - Part 4: Nested Generics'
recordingDate: 1405289878
description: 'Let the compiler work for you. Generics give us flexibility and reuse in our classes, methods, and interfaces. This time, we''ll explore Generics by combining the Generic Interface (from Part 2) with the Generic Method (from Part 3). We end up with a Nested Generic. For code samples and a PDF Walkthrough, visit http://www.jeremybytes.com/Demos.aspx#GEN. Future videos will explore other aspects of Generics (including constraints and the "default" keyword).'
