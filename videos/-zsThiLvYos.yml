description: "Istio Multi-Cluster Service Mesh Patterns Explained - Daniel Berg & Ram Vennam, IBM \n\nThis session will review the various multi-cluster service mesh deployment patterns that are available with Istio. We will explain the pros and cons of each approach to ensure that you have the information necessary to properly apply one or more of these patterns for your own needs. We will provide a demonstration to show how one would setup a multi-cluster Istio mesh using Kubernetes clusters. This session is a must see if you currently are, or considering, implementing a hybrid cloud solution. Even if you are not yet using a service mesh, this session will provide valuable information to help you on your own hybrid journey. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPf1"
