description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nDeveloping Operators with the Kubernetes Operator Pythonic Framework (kopf) - Sergey Vasilyev, Zalando SE \n\nThe Kubernetes operator pattern has revolutionized the way applications are deployed and managed in Kubernetes, but much of the tooling around building operators has focused on easing development in Golang. The Kubernetes Operator Pythonic Framework (kopf) levels the playing field, bringing much of the tooling to the Python ecosystem, and expanding it in several areas. Kopf provides powerful, high-level abstractions that make it simple to write Kubernetes operators in Python, allowing you to focus on your application logic without needing to dive headfirst into Kubernetes internals. In this talk, you will learn how to make your own Kubernetes operators in a few lines of Python code, and how to bring your own domain entities directly to Kubernetes. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UaXj"
