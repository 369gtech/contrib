description: "PyData is excited to announce PyData Global, November 11th - 15th! Tickets are now available: https://global.pydata.org/pages/tickets.html#pricing-and-ticket-purchases\nPart of an underrepresented group in tech? PyData Global is offering Diversity Scholarships. Applications close September 30th: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfcFaTqVFjMa6kWlLPeEynEcbp1WrCxyxMGyyh4BP33eAviaA/viewform\n\n\n\nJim Dowling - Hopsworks.AI - A feature Store for Machine Learning | PyData Fest Amsterdam 2020 \n\nA Feature Store enables machine learning (ML) features to be registered, discovered, and used as part of ML pipelines, thus making it easier to transform and validate the training data that is fed into machine learning systems.\n\nFeature stores can also enable consistent engineering of features between training and inference, but to do so, they need a common data processing platform. The first Feature Stores, developed at hyperscale AI companies such as Uber, Airbnb, and Facebook, enabled feature engineering using domain specific languages, providing abstractions tailored to the companies’ feature engineering domains. However, a general purpose Feature Store needs a general purpose feature engineering, feature selection, and feature transformation platform.\n\nIn this talk, we describe how we built a general purpose, open-source Feature Store for ML on the open-source Hopsworks platform with Apache Spark. We will show how the Feature Store enables end-to-end ML pipelines to be factored into feature engineering and data science stages that each can run at different cadences. And we will show how we built the world’s first managed feature store for the cloud, hopsworks.ai.\n\n===\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
