description: "This session discusses the promise of interoperability in the Java EE 7 platform and what has been done—even now, at its time of release—to maintain this. The session shows how a Java EE 7 application can be easily built using NetBeans and JBoss development tools. This application can then be deployed on JBoss, GlassFish, and Oracle WebLogic, showing the promise of interoperability. The state of Java EE 7 compliance for different application servers is discussed and demonstrated using live demos.\n\n\nAuthors:\nMax Andersen\nundefined\nView more trainings by Max Andersen at https://www.parleys.com/author/max-andersen\n\nPetr Jiřička\nDevelopment manager on the NetBeans team at Oracle.
