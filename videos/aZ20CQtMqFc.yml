Thomas has a Masters degree in Computer Science from the Royal Institute of Technology, KTH, in Stockholm. He has taught programming at The Royal Institute of Technology, KTH, one the leading technical universities in Sweden.\n\nThomas has developed an obsession for technical excellence that translates to software craftsmanship, clean code, test automation and continuous deployment.\n\nDefinition of done according to Thomas is working software, in production.\n\nHe runs a blog where he writes about programming, software craftsmanship, tdd, bdd and whatever problem he wants to share a solution about. It can be found at http://thomassundberg.wordpress.com/\n\nTalk summary \n\nBehaviour Driven Development, BDD, is a great way to drive the development of a system based sole on the desired behaviour of a system. Using Cucumber for Java will allow us to express the desired behaviour with examples so a non developer can understand what will work and what is expected of the system.\n\n\nBehaviour-Driven development, BDD, is a three-step procedure that lead us to implement the right software. I will show you the three parts\n\nDiscovery – find out what we should create\nFormalization – capture unambiguous examples that describe what we should build\nAutomation – run those examples as automated acceptance tests\nOur goal is to understand what our users want, formalize examples describing our current understanding, and finally automate the testing of the implementation. Each step is easy if done properly. The result? Software that support our business while making the life of both users and developers better."
