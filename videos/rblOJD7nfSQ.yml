description: "Modularity brings flexibility, agility, and maintainability. The Java community has tremendous experience with developing modular systems on top of the JVM, but the past years have given rise to Java-based systems with large JavaScript front ends. JavaScript has very different characteristics than Java and the JVM. How can we build modular JavaScript applications, and what benefits does this bring? This presentation provides an overview of the current state of the art for JavaScript modularity. It starts with design patterns within JavaScript code to create composable modules and includes a discussion of creating modular architectures spanning JavaScript and Java back ends. Furthermore, it touches on dependency management and module versioning.\n\n\nAuthors:\nPaul Bakker\nPaul is a software architect for Luminis Technologies. His current focus is on building modular enterprise applications and the cloud. He believes that modularity and the cloud are the two main challenges we have to deal with to bring technology to the next level, and is working on making this possible for mainstream software development. Today he is working on educational software focussed on personalised learning for high school students in the Netherlands. He is also responsible for pushing technology forward. Luminis strongly believes in open source and all the technology development they are doing happens in the open source community. Paul is an active contributor on projects such as Amdatu, Apache ACE, JBoss Forge and BndTools. \n\nHe has a background as trainer on Java related technology and is a regular speaker on conferences such as JavaOne, Devoxx and JFokus.\nView more trainings by Paul Bakker at https://www.parleys.com/author/paul-bakker-4\n\nSander Mak\nAfter getting his master's degree in Software Technology, Sander became a software developer/architect specializing in Java and application integration. Recently, data analysis and machine learning were added to his list of interests. Sander loves sharing knowledge, for example through his blog (at http://branchandbound.net) and by writing for the Dutch Java Magazine. He speaks regularly at various international developer conferences, sharing his passion for Java, alternative JVM languages and related technologies.\nView more trainings by Sander Mak at https://www.parleys.com/author/sander-mak\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
