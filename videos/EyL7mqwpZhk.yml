description: "We all make mistakes, as much as we try to write flawless code, every now and then an error slips through. In order to reduce this number we do code reviews to ensure the code meets certain standards and to see if the feature was properly implemented. But how do you do a good code review? How do you handle technical discussions? How do you keep your reviews focused and your discussions relevant? In this talk I would like to show you how you can do proper code reviews, what to look out for when doing them, how to give feedback to the developer and a bunch of other tips to improve this process.\n\nEVENT:\n\nDutch PHP Conference in 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nRick Kuipers\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pL_fJ2fQSZw"
