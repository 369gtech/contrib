recordingDate: 1520250076
description: 'Circle K, a typical fuel retail chain, arguably made famous by Keanu Reeve’s ultra smash hit movie of 1989 called “Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure.” Like the movie’s time travelling theme, it is foretold that by 2020 more than three-quarters of the S&P 500 companies will be comprised of businesses that are yet known to us. The term “software is eating the world” is not uncommon in the DevOps circle of today. This is an excellent enterprise transformation adventure, sprinkled liberally with devops principles, illustrating one important cog in the wheel for improving an antiquated and inefficient old school practices. At the core lies the a modern tale about ChatOps, build pipelines and continuous integration and deployment. Under the hood, the approach is grounded with Jenkins, Docker, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Kubernetes, and Jenkins Job Builder. Enterprises are forced to operate as a software shop and this presentation aims to share our findings with the macabre yet very excellent journey that is enterprise transformation at the Circle K.'
