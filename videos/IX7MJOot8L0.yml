title: 'Redux when you can - Leeor Aharon'
recordingDate: 1520847445
description: "Redux can help you manage your application state centrally and predictably. But a naive implementation will later hinder your applicationâ€™s scalability, reduce your ability to reuse code and components, and increase complexity. In this presentation, Leeor from Wix Engineering, provides an overview of what Redux is, why you should want to use it in your own applications, and how to plan its implementation so that your application remains scalable and manageable in the long run. Leeor also talks about side effects in Redux-based applications, the problems they introduce, and how you should (and can) pick the right way to deal with them in your applications.\n\nLeeor Aharon has been engineering software since 1998 and has worked in different fields, such as networking, security, cloud, and instant messaging. Recently, he has crossed the lines from backend to frontend, bringing his backend experience to bear on the Wix Code frontend."
