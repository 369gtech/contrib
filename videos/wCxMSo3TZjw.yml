title: 'ElixirConf 2021 - Jason Axelson - My Scenic Companion'
language: English

description: "I have always liked developing tools that assist me in my life and in my programming workflow. So when I attended the ElixirConf 2018 Nerves advanced training and came home with a nice 7” Raspberry Pi touchscreen I knew that I didn’t want it to just sit there and collect dust. So I put it to work and integrated it into my daily workflow.\n\nIn this talk I will describe the programs that I run on a Raspberry Pi that sits on my desk and have become a valued part of my daily workflow. The programs are built with Scenic, Phoenix and BlueHeron."
