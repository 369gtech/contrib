title: 'Strata 2013: James Hendler, "Broad Data: What Happens When the Web of Data Becomes Real?"'
recordingDate: 1362081889
description: "http://strataconf.com/\nRecently we have begun to see the emergence of a new online data challengeâ€”that of the \"Broad data\" that emerges from millions and millions of raw datasets available on the World Wide Web. For broad data the new challenges that emerge include Web-scale data search and discovery, rapid and potentially ad hoc integration of datasets, visualization and analysis of only-partially modeled datasets, and issues relating to the policies for data use, reuse and combination. In this talk, we present the broad data challenge and discuss potential starting points for solutions. We illustrate these approaches using data from a \"meta-catalog\" of over 1,000,000 open datasets that have been collected from about two hundred governments from around the world.\n\nhttp://strataconf.com/strata2013/public/schedule/detail/27609"
