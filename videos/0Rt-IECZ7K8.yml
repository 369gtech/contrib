description: "Anarchy Over Agility: The Rehabilitation of Leadership\n\nMany of us associate the word “Anarchy” with conditions like lawlessness and disorder. If you were to look in the dictionary you’d see a definition that might surprise you…“a society of individuals who enjoy complete freedom without government.” Once a beacon for autonomy and creativity within the software development community, the Agile movement has fallen prey to standardization, monetization and bureaucracy. Many in the community believe that this distortion of Agile has resulted from one specific variable; the negative influence of management. In response, developers around the world are looking to reclaim their Agile with the introduction of the Developer Anarchy movement; enabling complete freedom by eliminating the role of management entirely.\r\n\nDuring this interactive session we will explore the emergence of the Developer Anarchy movement and why removing the influence of management can unlock true agility in software development. We will explore the connection between Developer Anarchy and Self-Management, including concepts such as Holacracy and Sociocracy, showing how these ideas are fueling a new way people are organizing around work. Examining several real-world examples from companies like eBay, Zappos, and Valve Software, we will experiment with some tactical changes that can be implemented right away to drive more autonomy within your organization, such as Collaboration Contracts and Self-Selection. So if your Agile transformation doesn’t feel like it’s changing the way you work, maybe it’s time to insight a little anarchy!"
