description: "There’s never been a better time to adopt Go. The language is attracting more newcomers every day and by all accounts, its community has a lot to do with it. If, however, we want to retain what makes Go special beyond the language itself, we, as a community, must recognize and amplify what makes us great and address what threatens our unity.\n\nAs an early adopter and proponent of Go, Johnny has seen the community mature over the years, but from a perspective you might not expect. He will share both lived experiences and witnessed transformations that characterize what it means to be part of this amazing community and why it’s so important that we protect it now more than ever."
