description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\ncontainerd: Rootless Containers 2020 - Akihiro Suda, NTT \n\nRootless Containers means running the container runtimes (e.g. runc, containerd, and kubelet) as well as the containers without the host root privileges.  The most significant advantage of Rootless Containers is that it can mitigate potential container-breakout vulnerability of the runtimes, but it is also useful for isolating multi-user environments on HPC hosts.    This talk will contain the introduction to rootless containers and deep-dive topics about the recent updates such as Seccomp User Notification.  The main focus will be on containerd (CNCF Graduated Project) and its consumer projects including Kubernetes and Docker/Moby, but topics about other runtimes will be discussed as well. \n\nhttps://sched.co/fGWc"
