description: "Recording brought to you by American Express https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs\nLet's see how Kotlin Coroutines are used to solve real-life concurrency and coordination problems. With coroutines we don't have to worry about shared mutable state and synchronization. We can solve the problems we face using a number of communicating coroutines, where each piece of state is confined to a single coroutine.\n\nAbout the Presenter:\nRoman Elizarov is a professional software developer with more than 17 years of experience. He had started his career at Devexperts, where he designed and developed high-performance trading software for leading brokerage firms and market data delivery services that routinely handle millions of events per second. He is an expert in Java and JVM, particularly in real-time data processing, algorithms and performance optimizations for modern architectures. Roman currently works on Kotlin language at JetBrains. Having worked on very large systems compromising many modules written in different languages, he has a dream of a single language that can be used to write all parts of a very large distributed system, to share and reuse data models and algorithms without friction. Kotlin with JVM and JS backends and upcoming native compiler is the ideal candidate to realize this dream. In 2000 Roman had graduated from St. Petersburg ITMO. He now teaches a course on concurrent and distributed programming in ITMO. During his undergraduate study he participated at ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC). Since 1997 and until now Roman serves as a Chief Judge of Northeastern European Regional Programming Contest."
