However, some find it difficult and not sure how, others may be challenged by teammates that believe we need E2E test to validate all scenarios. Since it is sometimes difficult to get the idea when you are not used to viewing your product in components, I will use an abstract example of a Soup Dumpling to demonstrate how to break down what seems to be an inseparable piece to components and apply tests to them.\n\nI will take you through a fun journey of translating E2E test into component test that will give you confidence in the final product. Hopefully this will give you a fresh perspective when you look at your own product."
