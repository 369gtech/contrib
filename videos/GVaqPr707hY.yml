description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nSponsored Session: Mining Large Data Sets of Biomedical Omics Data Made Easy with Managed Kubernetes! Doug Davis, IBM & Theodore Alexandrov, EMBL\n\nSharing of Personal Information with Sponsors In order to facilitate networking and business relationships at the event, you may choose to visit a third partyʼs virtual booth or to access sponsored content. You are never required to visit third party booths or to access sponsored content. When visiting a booth (e.g. by clicking on a third partyʼs logo in the Solutions Showcase or exhibitor directory, and any actions within the booth thereafter including viewing resources), when accessing sponsored sessions in the Sponsor Theater, or by participating in sponsored activities, the third party will receive some of your registration data. This data includes your first name, last name, title, company, address, email, standard demographics questions (i.e. job function, industry), and details about the sponsored content or resources you interacted with. If you choose to interact with a virtual booth or access sponsored content, you are explicitly consenting to receipt and use of such data by the third-party recipients, which will be subject to their own privacy policies.\n\nWouldn’t it be nice to accelerate your delivery cycle by not focusing on Kubernetes? That’s exactly what developers from the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) did. Their mission: reveal the role that metabolites play in biology and medicine by finding the molecules hidden in big spatial metabolomics data. Their challenge: the amount of data they needed to analyze (sometimes larger than 1TB) required significant resources and compute power working at scale to produce timely results with a development team that were not K8s experts.\n\nIn this session, you'll learn how EMBL researchers used IBM Cloud Code Engine to speed-up their delivery cycle by allowing them to focus on their research and analytic engine development rather than worrying about the management and technical details of the compute resources needed to perform their data analysis."
