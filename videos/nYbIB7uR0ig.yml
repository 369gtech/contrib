How do you know when your idea is actually a good one?\r\n\r\nWeâ€™ll have more time for an open floor discussions and dialogue on this topic. And to go in depth into the discussion, like a chat.js (floor based exchange). So feel free to come with more questions or share your experience!\r\n\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/os7k/"
