description: "This talk combines two of the OWASP top ten security risks to highlight some widespread \"this is fine\" issues:\n\n* Injections (A1:2017): We are using a simple application exploitable by injection and will then secure it with the Web Application Firewall (WAF) ModSecurity.\n* Insufficient Logging & Monitoring (A10:2017): We are logging and monitoring both the secured and the unsecured application with the Elastic Stack."
