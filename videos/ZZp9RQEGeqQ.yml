description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTOpia Chicago 2021. #GOTOcon #GOTOpia\nhttp://gotochgo.com\n\nStefan Tilkov - Co-founder & Principal Consultant at INNOQ\n\nABSTRACT\nYes, there is a life beyond DDD. In the best sense of pattern languages, domain-driven design gives clear names to things that many developers and designers know how to do, but cannot reliably and compatibly communicate about. But like other very popular approaches, it is sometimes treated as if it were the only viable design strategy.\nIn this talk we’ll look at DDD’s contributions as well as some of the misunderstandings and misuses that come with the hype surrounding it. We’ll try to derive some useful guidelines for treating domain-driven design in particular, and software design hypes in general [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n00:26 What is DDD?\n04:27 Key aspect 1: Ubiquitous language\n04:52 Key aspect 2: Tactical patterns\n06:13 Key aspect 3: Strategic design\n07:00 Bounded contexts\n09:29 Conceptual extensibility\n15:15 Should design be domain-driven?\n26:30 Contexts revisited\n27:38 Is DDD overrated?\n31:05 Outro\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotochgo.com/2021/sessions/1778/is-domain-driven-design-overrated\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nSimon Brown • Software Architecture for Developers Vol. 2 • https://leanpub.com/visualising-software-architecture\nMark Richards & Neal Ford • Fundamentals of Software Architecture • https://amzn.to/3qmELt7\nGregor Hohpe • The Software Architect Elevator • https://amzn.to/3tY8evH\nMichael Keeling • Design It! • https://amzn.to/37y4OGH\nGeorge Fairbanks • Just Enough Software Architecture • https://amzn.to/3bbjqg3\nNick Rozanski & Eoin Woods • Software Systems Architecture • https://amzn.to/3ajYjsv\nPeter Coad, Eric Lefebvre & Jeff de Luca • Java Modeling In Color With UML • https://amzn.to/3bVDTHd\nEric Evans • Domain-Driven Design • https://amzn.to/3tnGhwm\nGrady Booch, James Rumbaugh & Ivar Jacobson • The Unified Modeling Language Reference Manual • https://amzn.to/2OA1Qv1\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#DDD #DomainDrivenDesign #SoftwareArchitecture #UX #UI #Udriven\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
