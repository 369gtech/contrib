recordingDate: 1499435269
description: "Spring I/O 2017 - 18 -19 May, Barcelona\n\nLink: https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cloud-app-engine-springboot/#0\n\nSee how we take a standard Spring Boot application, run it on Google Cloud Platform. We will demonstrate how your app will benefit from seamless scalability, and how to use our integrated tooling for testing and diagnostics to gain insights into what's going on with your application in production. In this talk, we go through this flow by deploying the application to the cloud via our build tooling, using two approaches: Google App Engine flexible and Kubernetes."
