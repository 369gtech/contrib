description: "http://CppCon.org\nHyrum Wright “Large-Scale Changes at Google: Lessons Learned From Five Years of Mass Migrations”\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2018\n—\nGoogle has one of the largest single C++ codebases on the planet, yet is able to continually update both core libraries and the code which uses them. In this talk, I'll share many of the lessons we've learned across more than five years of doing these kinds of migrations, including:\n* Why should you migrate in the first place? \n* How hard can it really be? \n* What happens when a change can't be done atomically? \n\nI'll also talk about the myriad ways that such a process can go wrong, using various migrations we've done internal to Google to illustrate. In doing so, I'll also point out how you can structure your infrastructure and tooling to enable a successful large-scale change process within your organization.\n— \nHyrum Wright, Google\nSoftware Engineer\n\nHyrum Wright hates C++ less than the rest of the programming languages he's worked with, and works on large-scale change infrastructure at Google. He writes programs to rewrite other programs, and will eventually put himself out of a job. In a former life, he was an author of Apache Subversion, and still retains membership in the Apache Software Foundation. Hyrum enjoys cycling, but didn't bring a bike to Seattle. \n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
