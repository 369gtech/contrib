title: 'microXchg 2016 - Tammo van Lessen, Alexander Heusingfeld : Donâ€™t Fly Blind: Logging and Metrics in M'
recordingDate: 1454699763
description: "\"While many organizations are keen on breaking up their monolithic applications and establishing microservice architectures, only few of them truly appreciate the impact on runtime information like log data and metrics. But without it you are almost blind in production. And without correlating events from different sources it becomes very difficult to make sense of your metrics and to draw accurate conclusions. If you want to break monoliths into a variety of distributed services, standard approaches are no longer sufficient.\nIn this session, we will show the conceptual foundation and best-of-breed tooling for a monitoring solution of a decentralized and distributed application landscape.\""
