title: 'DEF CON Safe Mode Voting Village - Cordero Delgadillo - A Lawyer''s Reflections on Elections'
language: English
recordingDate: 1597440011
description: "Join Cordero Alexander Delgadillo (@CORDERO_ESQ), a business and technology lawyer, and more recently a former political candidate, as he demonstrates that elections, especially local elections, are akin to information systems (even reasonably locked down systems), because both are highly susceptible to the very non-tech, human vulnerabilities (nefarious and negligent). In this talk Cordero will provide insight by:\n\n- Examining the structures of American Democracy\n- Telling stories from his own election lawsuit: Delgadillo v. City of Peoria et al\n- Highlighting election process issues deemed “inconsequential” or “un-addressable”\n- Sharing information and resources"
