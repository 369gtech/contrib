description: "motivations, challenges, weapons and achievements\n\nTatiana Al-Chueyr\n\nSaturday 15th, 10:30 (Room D)\nA talk (25 minutes)\n\nOnce upon a time, there was a collection of happy, but perhaps not so efficient, HTTP micro-services that was being developed as part of a major recommendation platform.\n\nDuring a snowy spring morning, their retirement was decreed. A new generation of gRPC micro-services was to replace them.\n\nWith the support of some brave pathfinders and a few sacrifices, the gRPC micro-services finally reached their destination.\n\nAnd they lived happily ever after.\n\nThis story is based on real facts. The pathfinders were data scientists and engineers, the date is early 2018 and the location is BBC, UK.\n\n    The speaker suggested this session is suitable for new programmers.\n    The speaker suggested this session is suitable for data scientists."
