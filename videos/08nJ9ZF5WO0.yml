recordingDate: 1496965099
description: "Paul DeCarlo & David Justice, Microsoft - ChefConf 2017\n\nIn this session, we will explore the building blocks of Chef, assemble the pieces, and demonstrate how it all works on Microsoft Azure. There will be several practical demonstrations showcasing how to use Chef to configure your virtual machines (VMs) and your infrastructure in Azure, and to automate your enterprise compliance. The session will bridge infrastructure as code as well as immutable infrastructure via Chef Habitat. Habitat particularly shines in striking the right balance between manageability, portability, and consistency in managing a fleet of microservice applications. We will also explore how we make it easy to run Habitat applications in Azure Container Service â€“ Kubernetes."
