description: 'Social Applications have been growing at an exponential rate and the nature of engagement and retention required for mobile makes engineering a game for this level of scale a particularly challenging proposition. In this presentation, I will discuss the aspects of Social Gaming 2.0 that present new challenges for massive scalability at real-time speed. I will describe the core architectural components and design principles of Machine Zone''s real-time Platform which can be used to address these challenges and support hundreds of thousands of concurrent actors in a single world instance.'
