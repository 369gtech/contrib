language: English
recordingDate: 1540249665
description: "In the past, when hackers did malicious program code injection, they used to adopt RunPE, AtomBombing, cross-process creation threads, and other approaches. They could forge their own execution program as any critical system service. However with increasing process of anti-virus techniques, these sensitive approaches have been gradually proactively killed. Therefore, hackers began to aim at another place, namely memory-level weakness, due to the breakages of critical system service itself. \n\nThis agenda will simply introduce a new memory injection technique that emerged after 2013, PowerLoadEx. Based on this concept, three new injection methods will be disclosed as well. These makes good use of the memory vulnerability in Windows to inject malicious behavior into system critical services. The content will cover Windows reverse analysis, memory weakness analysis, how to use and utilize, and so on. The relevant PoC will be released at the end of the agenda."
