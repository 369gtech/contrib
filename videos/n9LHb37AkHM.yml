description: "Do I want to track my cycles? Yes Do I want the tracker to push my data to a third party? Hell NO Do I want the data lying around unencrypted in a database somewhere? Not really Do I want backup and access from multiple devices? Kinda. Learn why this important beyond my personal preferences and how encryption can solve many of the privacy challenges we are experiencing in the current app economy. All this from a crypto n00b.\n\nAbout the speaker\nBenedicte Raae is an independent contractor, working as a full-stack developer. With a developer mom, she had free access to the Internet from an early age, but it was actually her Norwegian teacher that introduced her to HTML in 1997.
