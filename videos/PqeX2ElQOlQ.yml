language: Russian

description: "Ближайшая конференция: \nHolyJS 2021 Piter — 20-23 апреля, онлайн.\nПодробности и билеты: https://bit.ly/2LbN8bH\n\n. Development is a creative act. However, we spend a lot of time cleaning up our code, refactoring and doing other repetitive tasks. What if we could automate it?\n\nThis talk will show an alternative way of using Babel: usually, everyone thinks about it as a modern-to-old ECMAScript compiler, which also supports a few additional syntaxes like JSX or types. But what if it wasn't just that? Babel is a general-purpose ECMAScript code analyzer and transformer. It could be used to create linters, minifiers, static analysis in IDEs, or... codemods!\n\nHow can we leverage the Babel APIs to efficiently refactor hundreds of files, without manually doing the same thing over and over?"
