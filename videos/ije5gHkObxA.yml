title: 'Machine Learning Exposed Deep and Reinforcement Learning by Katharine Beaumont & James Weaver'
language: English
recordingDate: 1504105587
description: "In this session, James Weaver and Katharine Beaumont will give a gentle introduction to machine learning topics, and then explore in more detail the concepts of deep learning and reinforcement learning.  In the process we’ll give you an intuition on the maths behind these concepts.\n\nThis session is designed as a follow-on to the Machine Learning Exposed: Introduction to Machine Learning session, but contains enough fundamentals to be understood without having attended the introductory session.\nThe presenters are very aware that some material on machine learning can be maths-intensive, and off-putting if you are not confident with your calculus. Conversely, some material doesn’t go into enough detail so you don’t get a feel for how things actually work. We will start right at the beginning with the basics, and build up in an approachable way to some of the most interesting techniques so you can get the most out of your machine learning adventure.\n\nKatharine Beaumont is a Java developer by trade, turned Community & Content Manager for Voxxed: working on spreading knowledge and building communities.\n\nJames Weaver is a Java developer, author, and speaker with a passion for helping Java to be increasingly leveraged in cloud-native and machine learning applications. He is a Java Champion, and a JavaOne Rockstar. James has written books including Inside Java, Beginning J2EE, the Pro JavaFX series, and Java with Raspberry Pi. As an Pivotal Developer Advocate, James speaks internationally at software technology conferences about Java and Cloud Native development. James tweets as @JavaFXpert, blogs at http://JavaFXpert.com and http://CulturedEar.com and may be reached at jweaver [at] pivotal.io"
