title: 'Ten Ways to Make Your JavaFX App Shine'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433517917
description: "It’s not an exaggeration to say that applications are judged by their cover, and never before has it been more important to make them stand out from the rest. The problem is that for many developers, it’s almost impossible to get all the design details in place if you don’t have an eye for it. This session explains several design rules and applies them to make a JavaFX application look good. Layout, matching color maps, drop shadows, and fonts are just some of the things it demonstrates that can greatly improve the way applications are perceived.\n\n\nAuthors:\nMartin Gunnarsson\nGreat programmers are usually lousy designers, and vice versa, but Martin is one of those rare crossbreeds who can handle both. Graphics programming and GUI design suits him particularly well, but being a true perfectionist, heʼs rarely satisfied with the results of his own work. Martin comes from a Java/Swing background, but has been working almost entirely with JavaScript and Objective-C the last few years.\nView more trainings by Martin Gunnarsson at https://www.parleys.com/author/martin-gunnarsson\n\nPär Sikö\nPar is a java developer with a long and happy history that includes J2ME, Swing and JavaFX.\n\nHe's been working with Java since it's inception and tried everything from architecture and large enterprise systems to mobile devices. \n\nAs a developer Par is curious and thorough and knows the importance of pixels and colors. Curious to learn new things, growing as a human being in the process, and happy to teach and inspire others about it. Thorough to ensure that the quality is on par with expectations and, perhaps most importantly, to really understand something makes it so much easier and fun to work with. Pixels and Colors have never been as important as it is today, everything is measured by it's looks, and Par's focus on making beautiful applications is a deliberate strategy that has paid off numerous times.\n\nPar has been a busy speaker for the last couple of years, presenting on the international stage as well as on Swedish conferences.\n\nHe was awarded with a 'JavaOne Rock Star' for his presentation in San Francisco 2011. For Par, the key success factor in a presentation is mixing good content with a big portion of humour and he wishes that more people would dare to step away from boring bullet lists and do something new and creative when presenting.\nView more trainings by Pär Sikö at https://www.parleys.com/author/par-siko-1\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
