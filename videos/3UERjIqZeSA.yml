description: "Modelling Complex Game Economy with Neo4j\n\nhttp://www.codemesh.io/codemesh2014/yan-cui\n\nThe challenge of modelling and balancing the economy of a large scale game is one of the biggest problems game developers face and one that many have tried to solve by simply throwing man-hours at it... But there's a better way!\n\nLearn how Gamesys did it by leveraging graph database Neo4j to model the in-game economy of our MMORPG “Here Be Monsters” and automate the balancing process. We'll discuss lessons learned, successes and challenges, and how a graph database enables our small team of game designers to stay agile and focused on delivering new content to players.\n\nTalk objectives:\n\nIllustrate, with a real-world example of a large scale MMORPG, how the power of graph databases can be harnessed to model and automate the otherwise difficult and laborious task of balancing a game.\n\nTarget audience:\n\n* Developers interested in graph database\n* Developers and game designers interested in learning about how to use the power of graph to model and automate game balancing"
