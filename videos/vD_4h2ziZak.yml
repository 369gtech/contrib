description: "7 Deadlier Sins of Leadership\nIn each part of the presentation we discuss one of the deadly sins. For each sin, I will present a behaviour that we can observe in leaders' work related with this sin and a cognitive bias that makes us, as human, to behave that way. Please find details of each part of the presentation.\n\nAt the end of the presentation, I show that these wrong behaviours can be changed to good ones (providing examples). This set of good behaviours can be a very good foundation to build an organisation culture supporting agility, autonomy and employee satisfaction. - Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/stretch"
