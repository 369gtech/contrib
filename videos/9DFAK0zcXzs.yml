description: "\"Writing-wroom and Content Delivery API, the 10 Fundamentals of Fixing Modern Content Management Problems\"\n\nCode Mesh London is the best place in Europe for non-mainstream tech and programming languages. On 4-5 December 2013 over 50 inventors and originators of the most innovative languages and technologies of the moment shared their experience with 200 attendees. Topics included Scala, Haskell, Clojure, Erlang, Elixir, Julia and much more. See you at Code Mesh 2014! codemesh.io/\n\nAbout the talk:\nContent is everywhere. When you are creating a website, a web application, a game or a native mobile app - big or small, you have to deal with content at some point. Which inevitably has you asking questions: where do I store content? How can I modify texts? Fix typos, evolve and expand my work?\nTraditionally, the industry's answer to these questions has been to adopt a Content Management System. This answer is particularly dissatisfying, not only because of the inherent limitations of available CMS's offerings, but because there is a fundamental problem with the concept of a CMS: it has the wrong focus, and it does too many things. Imposing a traditional CMS has inevitably big negative implications on developers and designers' productivity and tools.\nFor solving content management challenges, we need to approach the problem differently. Writing-wroom & Content Delivery API is a new approach to the problem. This talk will go through the different content management challenges, and will introduce the 10 fundamentals for addressing these challenges in a Writing-wroom & Content Delivery API platform:\n- Structured Content with a comfy text and media editor\n- Versioning and changes tracking\n- Release oriented and previews\n- Simplified collaboration workflow\n- Content delivery API with fulltext search capabilities\n- Developers tools: API browser and development kits\n- Scalability, Cacheability and Low Response time\n- High Availability\n- Security and authorisations"
