description: "Most engineers face problems that are new to them from time to time. Sometimes reading the docs is enough to solve it. Sometimes, there is someone who can help you out. Some other times, you have to dig in by yourself. When things get as deep as JVM, many engineers tend to back down.\n\nBut come on, HotSpot is not a mysterious machine. It is opensource, after all! All the seemingly weird JVM behavior can be reproduced, and explained if one goes just a bit deeper.\n\nThis talk will take the audience to the fun world of the JVM sources and review several case studies that are initially puzzling, but are actually quick to be dissolved."
