description: "Speaker(s):\nAndrew Jeon, Chris Mckillop, Leo Baghdassarian\n\nDescription:\nWith the new release, Android is a single platform across phones, tablets, and televisions - allowing Android developers to extend their reach across all screens to the biggest screen in the house. We've introduced several TV APIs, a TV SDK and UX framework to make this really easy for both content and game developers. This session will cover some background on the television space, a deeper demo of the platform, UX best practices in the 10-ft living room space, and ways for developers to get started.\n\n\"Now You See Me\" by Lionsgate, available on Google Play\n\nWatch all Google I/O 2014 videos at: g.co/io14videos"
