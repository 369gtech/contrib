description: "Tom McLaughlin, ServerlessOps\n\nAbstract: \nWith the rise of serverless architecture, many of the common day-to-day operations tasks will change dramatically, if not disappear completely. We as Operations professionals will be challenged to redefine our roles and responsibilities within the technology organization as serverless abstracts away the server and its respective OS to cloud service providers. No stranger to this scenario, we will not only be tasked with solving these engineering obstacles introduced by the new serverless paradigm, but we will also need to prove our value to the business in the face of a changing technology landscape… again.\n\nThis is a combination professional/cultural and technical talk. We’ll start by discussing the disruption that serverless presents to operations and why. While DevOps and public cloud are becoming commonplace, serverless is the beginning of a new disruption cycle. We need to understand why serverless is disruptive and learn from the lessons of the past.\n\nThe talk will continue on to discuss the value of operations work and understanding the relationship between work and value. Not all work has the same value and we need to understand this so we prioritize the best use of our time.\n\nFinally I will walk through the current state of serverless engineering and tools, and show how and where we fit in. For our career longevity and security we need to understand how we fit.\n\nA few areas I’ll discuss include:\n\nDevOps and public cloud… And how serverless is starting a new disruption cycle 10 years later.\nUnderstanding and determining the value of your work\nMoving up the value chain and closer to customer success metrics.\nTeam reorganization to better align with business success.\nServerless architectural decision making\nPerformance management and cost containment\nFailure monitoring and service handling\nSecurity risk and concerns\nIf you’re an Operations engineer and you had all your host and OS related work removed from you, would you know what to do to stay busy and demonstrate your value to your organization?\n\nView the full LISA18 Program at https://www.usenix.org/lisa18/conference-program"
