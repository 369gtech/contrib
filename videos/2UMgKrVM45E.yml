title: 'Let''s Build an Operating System! LIVE'
language: English
recordingDate: 1604082596
description: "Operating Systems are the foundation upon which we build software programs, but how do they work? In this episode of the \"Let's Build an X\" game show, we'll learn about how Operating Systems work as I demo a few simple examples in the Assembly Language. No previous assembly experience required! In under an hour, we'll build a tiny OS and discuss ways Machine Learning can optimize it. You'll have to answer 3 timed multiple choice questions throughout the stream and I'll declare a winner at the end. The winner receives a cash prize during the Victory Royale award ceremony at the end (also I'll freestyle + sing for them).\n\nSubscribe for more educational videos!"
