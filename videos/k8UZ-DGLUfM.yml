description: "Come with me as we walk through implementing a new feature of Riak with riak_test. We'll go through adding a feature to Riak with Test Driven Development, going into as much detail as time will allow. We won't be delving into the internals of riak_test, but rather how we use it to test Riak. \n\nTalk objectives: Attendees of this talk should leave with an understanding of how to add a feature to Riak using Test Driven Development and riak_test and how those techniques and tools might be applicable to their own projects.\n\nTarget audience: This talk would appeal to anyone who is interested in how one could apply TDD techniques to a project as large as Riak. Also those curious about riak_test."
