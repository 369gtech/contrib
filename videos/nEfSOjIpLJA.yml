description: "Unity Developers can take advantage of the Google Cast Remote Display API to extend their games onto a TV by use of the Google Cast Remote Display Plugin for Unity.\n\nThe plugin supports games built for iOS as well as Android.\n\nThis video shows a walk through of the Android based code lab available to teach how to integrate Google Cast Remote Display for Unity based games. The full code lab is available at https://www.code-labs.io/codelabs/cast-unity-plugin/ for developers to try.\n\nThe Google Cast Remote Display API allows developers to leverage the GPU power in mobile devices to render high frame-rate, responsive gaming and send it to a TV for large screen display. Using the Unity plugin simplifies the integration effort significantly and makes it easy to build a Google Cast enabled game.\n\nFor more information about the Google Cast Remote Display API, see https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/remote and take a look at the Game Manager API https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/gaming which makes it easy to build multi-player gaming experiences.\n\n#googlecast"
