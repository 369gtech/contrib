description: "Filmed at https://2020.dotswift.io on February 3, 2020 in Paris. More talks on https://dotconferences.com/talks\n\nSwift is a great language. But we’ve all met situations where a certain feature was missing, and we wished were part of it.\nSince programs are basically functions, and functions are first-class citizen in Swift, Vincent shows how we can implement “pseudo-keywords” at a short cost and to great value."
