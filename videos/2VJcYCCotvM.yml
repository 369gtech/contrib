description: "RubyHACK 2018: GraphQL on Rails - Creating Living APIs for a Data-hungry World by Jeremy Ward\n\nWe live in a dynamic, data-responsive world. We must create living APIs to feed the ever evolving needs of a wide array of applications. GraphQL, an unassuming alternative to REST, empowers our creations by serving fast, flexible responses in a type-safe and predictable fashion. Faster apps, rapid iteration, and living documentation means everyone wins. \n\nIn this talk, we’ll compare GraphQL with our existing API standard, REST. We’ll then learn some GraphQL basics and see what it looks like to serve GraphQL from a Rails application. We’ll finish by discussing how to incorporate GraphQL into your existing project."
