description: "Many organizations today strive to establish autonomous development teams who can move as independently of each other as possible.\nThe goal is to achieve speed, scalability and motivation - but what does architecture governance look like in such a decentralised setup? Iâ€™ll discuss how to keep everybody aligned on a shared understanding of the architecture and avoid prescriptive standardisation without getting chaos.\n\nAbout Birgitta Boeckeler\nBirgitta is a Principal consultant and developer with ThoughtWorks. She has been building software across all layers for more than 15 years, mainly in the space of large custom-developed websites. At ThoughtWorks, she spends most of her time as a Lead Developer, splitting her days between coding, coaching, consulting and keeping things fun."
