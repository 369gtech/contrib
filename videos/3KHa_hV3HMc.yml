language: Italian
recordingDate: 1464086607
description: 'JavaScript is an asynchronous and almost single-thread language. Learning how to manage its asynchronous nature is perhaps the most important part of becoming an effective JavaScript programmer. Reactive programming tools in JavaScript provide a powerful way of “wrapping” the asynchronous callbacks into a more readable and maintainable code base. In this talk, I''ll highlight the pros and cons of different reactive programming approaches and practices by demonstrating how to use Redux and Angular 2.x as the building blocks of a scalable architecture for your web app.'
