description: 'The best way to learn programming is to build something. I learned Clojure by building various programs around the two player Gin Rummy card game. This talks shows usages and features of Clojure as I discovered and applied them over the years. Starting from functions and data to model the game, to Java interop to create a robot and from ClojureScript for a web site version to Datomic as a back-end for playing over a network. As well as my current project of trying to build another AI to play the game.'
