description: "Ever when you started programming, did you ever wonder when will I use this in real life? I remember my first programming courses, where they gave me exercises with techniques that personally I never thought I could apply them to real life, less to the world of pentesting, and running some white box tests, I found a manual blindsqlinjection, but it was very slow, very tedious, and you can imagine, very noisy, so I decided to apply this algorithm to my script finding that all that knowledge was not in vain, but I could apply it in my day to day. This is the story. \n\nManaged by the OWASP® Foundation\nhttps://owasp.org/"
