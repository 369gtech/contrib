description: "Speaker: Austin Freel\r\n\r\nHi there, my name is Austin and I've been a SWE at Facebook for nearly 3 years now where I've worked on things like VR, Groups, and Ads. Before joining full-time, I interned at Facebook (twice), and during one of my internships I built the rainbow pride profile picture filter at a hackathon. My talk is about that hackathon, the experience of going from late-night idea to global launch in 72 hours, and the lessons I learned along the way that have made me a better engineer.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/austin-freel-324b2269/\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/Junior-Developers-Singapore/events/264959348/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/CDcvi/"
