description: "What does it mean to design a product in a world where people own multiple connected devices and are already using them interchangeably, in order to accomplish a single goal? This hands-on webcast presentation by Michal Levin author of Designing Multi-Device Experiences, explores three key patterns to addressing this new reality: consistent, complementary, and continuous. Michal will show how these patterns can be used to develop a rich, contextual experience across different devices, keeping in mind the one thing that matters most: people.\n\nAbout Michal Levin\n\nMichal Levin, Senior User Experience Designer at Google, has extensive practice in UX design for web, mobile, and TV.
