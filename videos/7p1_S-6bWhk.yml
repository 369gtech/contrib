description: "The JVM is a remarkable piece of software. As a Java developer, you see a black box and feed Java code into it, and it somehow magically runs that code—and ideally runs it incredibly fast. But what’s actually going on? This presentation takes simple Java code and traces its journey through the JVM as it is compiled, interpreted, compiled again, optimized, deoptimized, and eventually submitted to the processor as native instructions. You will learn about all those black box layers that make Java code run fast and will be a better Java developer as a result.\n\n\nAuthor:\nCharles Nutter\nCharles has been programming most of his life, as a Java developer for the past decade and as a JRuby developer for over six years. He co-leads the JRuby project, an effort to bring the beauty of Ruby and the power of the JVM together. Charles believes in open source and open standards and hopes his efforts on JRuby and other languages will ensure the JVM remains the preferred open-source managed runtime for many years to come.\nView more trainings by Charles Nutter at https://www.parleys.com/author/charles-nutter-4\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
