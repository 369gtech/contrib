language: English
recordingDate: 1585253940
description: "Node.js 10.5.0 introduced 'worker_threads', enabling the creation of simple multi-threaded applications in JavaScript. This may sound daunting if you've never dealt with threads before in another language. But JavaScript threads are pretty simple and, very importantly, fun. This talk will be a quick introduction to the fun of worker_threads.\n\nI promise not to make any \"you got your multi-threaded chocolate in my single-threaded JavaScript peanut butter\" jokes.\n\nThumbnail photo by Etienne Girardet on Unsplash\n\nSlides: https://www.palacefamilysteakhouse.com/multimedia/jsconfhi2020.pdf\n\nStory of University of Hawaii and Ethernet: https://mailchi.mp/d93c463d5650/the-secret-nerd-history-of-hawaii\n\nJSConf Hawaii will return soon\nhttps://www.jsconfhi.com/"
