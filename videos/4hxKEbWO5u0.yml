title: 'GopherCon 2020: Jonathan Bodner - Go is Boring... And That''s Fantastic!'
language: English
recordingDate: 1608667811
description: "Many developers who are introduced to Go are surprised by all of the features it doesn’t have. Where is the inheritance, the functional programming, the exceptions? What are the innovative new features? Why has the language changed so little over the past 10 years? Why are there so few abstractions? It seems too simple, a throwback. In short, they find Go boring.\n\nBut being boring is actually Go’s superpower. Go has a back to basics approach because it makes it easier to build modern software. The most important feature in a language is how easy it is to write maintainable software that can adapt over time to changing requirements. When you focus on this, Go starts looking a lot better and all those new features and rapid iterations in other languages start looking like liabilities. Go is not exciting. It doesn't have cool new features. But it helps you get the job done. Because Go is boring, it allows you to write exciting software that meets your users’ needs. And that’s pretty fantastic."
