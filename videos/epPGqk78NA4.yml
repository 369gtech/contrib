description: "Google Tech Talk\nNovember 7, 2007\n(click \"show more\" for more info)\nPresented by Hank Mishkoff.\n\nABSTRACT\nIn a world of increasing specialization, Hank Mishkoff likes to think of himself as a generalist. (Some people have suggested that this means that he can do a lot of different things, but is not especially good at any of them.) At various times in his life, he's been a professional musician, a published author, a database programmer, and a Web developer. In his spare time, he won a precedent-setting lawsuit (TaubmanSucks.com) that secured the right to use trademarks in \"gripe\" site domain names. He claims to have saved the world from nuclear destruction (WebFeats.com/EOD), but this has not been independently verified. Having run out of other interesting things to do, he invented the xBook."
