description: 'The Google Games Chat is back! Now with a little bit of structure! Come check out the hot new property that Web Pro News raved "a show", and what we here at Google call "45 minutes away from doing real work." We''ll be chatting about games, industry trends, and making bold new predictions that will probably look ridiculously wrong in three years. As always, please ask questions in the Google Moderator section below, and we might even get around to answering one or two.'
