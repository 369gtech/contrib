description: "The IoT is dramatically changing our working and living landscape, with billions of things talking to each other, it is opening new business opportunities and the promise of a better-connected world. From building surveillance, connected cars or smart cities to monitoring workers in risky environments, the IoT has a lot to offer. Gaining and retaining consumer trust in data exchange and privacy is essential for the IoT to reach its potential. IoT Security is a crucial challenge and IoT players need to ensure an end-to-end secure IoT ecosystem that everyone can trust in. Security solutions have to protect each and every asset, transaction, data access and API to guarantee data integrity and trust. Security-by-design should be a given as building security into products from the ground up, ensuring devices are shielded from attacks as much as possible, from the core to the edge of IoT applications.\n\nThe speech was given on 2017-05-18 at infoShare 2017 (Startup Stage) in Gdańsk.\nhttp://infoshare.pl\n\nFollow infoShare:\nhttps://facebook.com/infosharepl\nhttps://twitter.com/infosharepl\nhttps://instagram.com/infoshare/\nhttps://linkedin.com/company-beta/1272775/\nhttps://plus.google.com/+infoshare/"
