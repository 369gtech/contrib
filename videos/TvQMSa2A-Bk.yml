description: "Why is it that there are so many different options in the JVM space for building web applications but so few when it comes to desktop applications? This presentation addresses this question by showcasing a set of tools that can help you build JavaFX-powered applications without having to battle the build itself. It begins by looking at Gradle for defining the basic structure, then it covers Griffon as the means of putting all the pieces in their right place and TestFX as the testing library of choice, and finally it closes by circling back to Gradle and its deployment options.\n\n\nAuthors:\nAndres Almiray\nAndres is a Java/Groovy developer and a Java Champion with more than 12 years of experience in software design and development.
