description: "Workplace Zen: Cultivating Effective Habits for Handling Conflict at Work\n\nAs UXers, we face conflict often. What we do is not always understood across organisations, and our roles involve plenty of collaboration across business units. What is best for the user doesn’t always match what is most appealing to Finance or what is easiest to implement for Tech. But conflict can be both good and bad – how you respond to it is what counts. Sometimes, it’s our instinctive, unconscious reactions to conflict that turn it into something negative. In this talk, I’m going to explain simple, concrete habits you can start to cultivate today that will help ensure more positive outcomes when conflict strikes.\n\nAbout the speaker: \nByron Fernandes https://twitter.com/byron_ux – Experience Design Lead at MOO. He's made his mark on Addison Lee’s latest mobile app, Costa Express’ interface for self-serve coffee bars, the Telegraph’s internal Authoring tool to name a few.\n\nAbout the conference:\nAt The UX Conference on February 20th 2018 in London we were exploring how to improve collaboration between designers and business stakeholders. The event was organised by The School of UX http://schoolofux.com and kindly supported by Balsamiq, TestingTime, Axure, Loop11, UsabilityHub, Optimal Workshop and Proto.io.
