title: 'Launching the Micro Future: Grails and Micronaut'
recordingDate: 1586857504
description: "Micronaut is a new JVM-based, full-stack framework for building modular, easily testable microservice applications. Reflection-based IoC frameworks load and cache reflection data for every single field, method, and constructor in your code; with Micronaut, your application startup time and memory consumption are not bound to the size of your codebase. The Micronaut framework shares many core values with Grails, including the enablement of code simplicity and developer productivity. Micronaut offers many additional features for a new class of applications (e.g., microservices, serverless deployments, etc.) that may not be well-suited for Grails.\n\n  Compelling aspects of the Micronaut framework include:\n  Sub-second startup time\n  Tiny processes that may run in as little as 8mb of heap\n  No runtime reflection\n  Dependency injection\n  Load balancing\n  And more!\nIn this talk, he will demonstrate how the future of Grails, GORM, and Micronaut are linked,"
