description: "PyData Tel Aviv Meetup #22\n3 April 2019\nSponsored and Hosted by SimilarWeb\nhttps://www.meetup.com/PyData-Tel-Aviv/\n\nNamed Entity Recognition is one of the key tasks in commercial Natural Language Processing applications. Its objective is to identify named entity mentions, such as people, organizations, and locations, in running text. State-of-the-art approaches are purely data-driven, leveraging deep neural networks. In this talk, I will present a few of those works, followed by a description of our own deep NER implementation, based on TensorFlow. We'll look at accuracy, speed, and memory footprint, while comparing some of the best known deep architectures with a basic statistical approach.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nFind a PyData chapter near you: meetup.com/pro/pydata"
