description: 'Microservices as an architectural style have found broad acceptance in the community, but the industry still lags behind. Scalability and resilience are two of the most interrelated properties, but many companies do not deem them necessary (ain''t Netflix!) or overly complex (works better without!). From an organisational point of view, what are the benefits of microservices? And what properties does an organisation need in order to be ready for microservices? Inverse-conway, distributed decision-making skills, trusting management, true orientation towards business objectives and solving the lumberjack''s problem can help your company being microservices-ready.'
