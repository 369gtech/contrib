title: 'JavaScript for emails, are you sure? - Phil Nash - NDC Sydney 2020'
language: English
recordingDate: 1630507219
description: "HTML emails are a time capsule for the web. Tables for layout and inline styles abound. You can't even use JavaScript.\n\nOr can you?\n\nAMP for email is a project by the AMP Project to bring interactivity to emails. We'll take a look at what this means for email development, the abilities it affords us in progressively enhancing our communications and demonstrate how to build an interactive email live.\n\nIs this the future of email or a really bad idea? Together we'll work it out."
