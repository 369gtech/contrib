title: 'Illustrated Tales of Go Runtime Scheduler. Ankur Anand'
recordingDate: 1597612549
description: "Concurrency in Go in form of Goroutine and channels is a very convenient means for writing modern concurrent software and often seems like magic, but how does our Go Program run these goroutines efficiently? From where does this magic comes to Go?\nIn this talk Ankur will look under the hood, to help understand how Go runtime scheduler implements this magic and how to use it to interpret the scheduler trace information of Go Program during the performance debugging."
