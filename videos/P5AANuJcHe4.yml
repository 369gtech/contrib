title: 'Prevent, Rather than Fix: Scaling to Enable Customers - Jason Ding Keynote'
recordingDate: 1433117466
description: "From Velocity Santa Clara 2015: At any company, scale needs to be a priority in order to serve customers of any size. You will have two choices to support the customer’s go-live: (1) Stage the go-live process and fix scale issues while the customer is going through the production phases; or (2) Identify and address scale issues prior to production by simulating peak traffic patterns. It is important to test customer solutions using high fidelity simulations prior to production deployment. The keys to a good simulation are:\n1. Representative data and configuration\n2. Use cases / business operations\n3. Simulation run rules – cache conditions, background noise, simulation time, etc.,\n4. Factor for growth based on business projections\n5. Iterative enhancement learned from production traffic\n\nThis keynote is sponsored by Salesforce.\n\nAbout Jason Ding (Salesforce.com):\nJason Ding is senior director of Performance Engineering @ Salesforce.
