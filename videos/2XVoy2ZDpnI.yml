description: "Monitoring is difficult. First, there is a vast choice of tooling and setup. Then, figuring out what information should be displayed, where and why can be confusing. Finally what should be alerted upon and how to avoid fatigue.\nTogether we will journey through a practical tour of dashboarding. Focusing on metrics, we will cover how to get information out of your applications using telemetry. I will show you how you might set up your monitoring infrastructure with a demo and talk through some hardened baselines. Finally, Iâ€™ll talk through a productionised setup including some gotchas to look out for.\n\nThis will be a whirlwind tour from start to finish of a practical guide to development dashboarding.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
