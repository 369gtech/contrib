description: "by Nicolas Frankel\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/UA2.118/kotlin_designing_a_dsl.webm\n\nKotlin is one of those “new” JVM languages that are currently rocking the boat. Although it’s made a great impact on Android, it’s equally good on the server side. As Domain-Specific Languages are constrained by the language they run on, Kotlin frees developers from Java fluent builders to propose something better.\n\n\nUsing the Vaadin web framework as an example, I’ll demo how one could design its own DSL with Kotlin.\n\nRoom: UA2.118 (Henriot)\nScheduled start: 2020-02-02 15:20:00"
