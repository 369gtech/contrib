description: "Persistent Data Structures for Special Occasions\n\nClojure(Script) programmers know the power of sophisticated data structures; after all, the built-in suite of persistent data structures is a major factor contributing to the elegance with which complex ideas can be expressed in Clojure. This presentation aims to familiarize the broader Clojure community with several additions to the built-in suite of PDSs available off-the-shelf in the form of Contrib libraries.\n\nLongtime contributor to all parts of ClojureScript, including the compiler and the core library; most notably, author of the ClojureScript ports of the persistent map and set types and PDS-related functionality such as transients. Author and maintainer of core.rrb-vector and data.avl."
