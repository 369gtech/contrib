title: '#bbuzz 2015: Konark Modi -  Designing NRT(NearRealTime) stream processing systems: Using Storm'
recordingDate: 1433323884
description: "Find more information here: http://berlinbuzzwords.de/session/designing-nrtnearrealtime-stream-processing-systems-using-storm\n\nThe essence of near-real-time stream processing is to compute huge volumes of data as it is received. This talk will focus on creating a pipeline for collecting huge volumes of data anfd processing near-real time using Storm. \n\nStorm is a high-volume, continuous, reliable stream processing system developed at BackType and open-sourced by Twitter. Storm is being widely used in lot of organizations and has variety of uses-cases like:    \n\n* Realtime analytics     \n\n* Distributed RPC     \n\n* ETL etc.   \n\n \n\n  During the course of 40 minutes using an example of Real-time Wikipedia edit we will try and understand:   \n\n * Basic concepts of stream-processing.  \n\n   * High level understanding of components involved in Storm.     \n\n* Writing producer in Python which will will push in Queue the real-time edit feed from Wikipedia.     \n\n * Write storm topologies in python to consume feed and process real-time metrics like:           \n\n      * Number of articles edited.       \n\n      * Category wise count of articles being edited.      \n\n      * Distinct people editing the articles       \n\n      * GeoLocation counters etc.   \n\n * Technological challenges revolving around near-real time stream processing systems:    \n\n * Achieve low latency for processing as compared to batch processing.      \n\n * State-management in workers to maintain aggregated counts like counting edits for same category of articles.         \n\n * Handling failures and crashes\n\n * Deployment Startergies."
