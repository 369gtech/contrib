description: "React Native introduces a new way to write native mobile apps. You can take everything that you know and love about React and apply it to native apps. Unlike hybrid apps, it gives you access to both native APIs and UI components. The application logic uses JavaScript whereas, the UI is fully native! It also brings the best of the web to native, things like â€“ flexbox layout model, XMLHttpRequest, requestAnimationFrame, etc.\n\nEvent sponsored by Rangle http://rangle.io/ and Microsoft Canada \n\nVarun Vachhar\nhttps://twitter.com/winkerVSbecks\nhttps://github.com/winkerVSbecks\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
