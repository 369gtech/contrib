description: 'Splitting your application into a bunch of microservices is a non trivial task with a lot of challenges, that might end up in with a complete different system in terms of architecture, components and more importantly the API surface you’re exposing; and that’s breaking the clients. Can we prevent that somehow? In this presentation we will start with a sample monolithic application and start to refactor it into a set of microservices using a naive approach, taming all the problems that will rise one by one, discovering how a REST architectural style for the WebAPI as well as an API Gateway are invaluable tools for journey. At the end of the presentation, we’ll see how we can switch from the monolithic version to the microservices version without breaking the clients at all.'
