title: 'YOW! Connected 2016 Patrick Catanzariti - Bringing Virtual Reality to the Web in 2016'
recordingDate: 1485234264
description: "Despite a lot of hype this year, virtual reality is still unexplored and uncharted territory for many developers. The mobile web brings an easy way to create VR experiences for the masses without requiring them to download yet another app. WebVR has made leaps and bounds throughout 2015, with a range of new frameworks out there that make building WebVR experiences incredibly straightforward and cross-platform. In this talk, Patrick, the founder of DevDiner.com, will discuss the history of WebVR and then look at frameworks such as A-Frame, Primrose and Google’s VR View, and the strengths of each option compared to building experiences using Three.js or WebGL alone. He’ll also cover what WebVR is capable of and its current limitations on the different platforms to date — including Google Cardboard, Samsung Gear VR, Oculus Rift, HTC Vive and PlayStation VR.\n\n“Patrick ””PatCat”” Catanzariti is the founder of Dev Diner, a site helping developers navigate the world of emerging tech with a weekly newsletter, interviews with industry pioneers, opinion pieces and guides for various technologies. He is a SitePoint editor for the HTML/CSS Channel and for emerging tech coverage on the site such as the Internet of Things, virtual/augmented/mixed reality, artificial intelligence and more. He is also an instructor at SitePoint Premium and O’Reilly, a Meta Pioneer and a freelance web developer who clearly loves every opportunity to tinker with something new in a tech demo.\n\nPatCat is always happy to help newcomers get started in the industry and believes that the key to entering this new era of emerging technologies successfully is to have as many developers entering the field and sharing their knowledge and experience together. If you have any questions around emerging tech, PatCat is your guy.”\n\nFor more on YOW! Connected, visit http://connected.yowconference.com.au"
