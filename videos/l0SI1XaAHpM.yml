description: ".NET Summit 2020 Online Edition https://dotnetsummit.by - the 4th community driven .NET conference dedicated to practical experience of solving business challenges with .NET and technical challenges in .NET application.\n\nOleg Karasik, Bugs?! Where do they come from? [RU]\n\nThis session is about bugs and where do they come from, about what we, as developers, can (and should) do. In this session we will take a look at a few simple, but yet representative, examples of application bugs. We will see how these bugs were made and what developers usually do to prevent them. Besides examples, in this session we will see usage of different concepts which help to prevent both simple and tricky bugs. \nDespite, all examples are done in C# on .NET, demonstrated concepts and approaches can be extrapolated to any strongly-typed, object-oriented language. \n\nGeneral Partner - ISsoft - https://issoft.by"
