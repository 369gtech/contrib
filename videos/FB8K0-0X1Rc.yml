description: "Brendan will prove that any object, anything that is designed or made, can and should be imbued with the capacity to be loved. To him, that means creating objects with almost human-like flaws; idiosyncrasies that people can latch on to and learn to fall in love with. In this talk, Brendan takes you through the objects he makes, from iPhone apps to physically-connected objects and how he attempts to keep them both beautifully simple, yet alive with the poetry that he believes should be at the heart of all human-computer interactive design.\n\nBrendan Dawes\nDesigner and Artist, Singleman\nhttp://uk.linkedin.com/in/brendandawes\nhttp://twitter.com/brendandawes\nhttp://instagram.com/brendandawes\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
