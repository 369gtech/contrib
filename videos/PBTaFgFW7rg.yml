description: "Tom Gilb is an American systems engineer, consultant, and author, known for the development of software metric, software inspection, and evolutionary processes. He coaches managers and product owners, writes papers, develops the courses, and is writing his own book, Evo – “Evolutionary Project Management & Product Development”.\n\nCurrent software architecture needs to be improved by moving in the direction of Engineering methods – including a lot more quantification of requirements, qualities and costs. As well as a lot more articulation of information about priority factors, risk elements and stakeholder ownership. We propose 10 basic principles of Software & Systems Architecture Engineering to define a necessary change of direction.\n\nCheck out more about I T.A.K.E.
