This leaves Enterprise Architect role in the dust, seemingly killing it off. In addition to this being disquieting to EAs out there who have steep mortgage payments and other expensive hobbies, it seems to drop out the original benefits of enterprise architecture, namely oversight of all IT-related activities to make sure things both don’t go wrong (e.g., with spending, poor tech choices, problematic integration, etc.) and that things, rather, go right.\n\nI’ve spoken with several EA teams over the past few years about the changing nature of how EAs can help in a DevOps- and cloud-native-driven culture. I’ll share their experiences including what type of EA help is actually needed and helps organizations thrive.\n\nMichael Cote \nFrom Pivotal\nMichael Coté works at Pivotal on the advocate team. He’s been an industry analyst at RedMonk and 451 Research, worked in corporate strategy and M&A at Dell in software and cloud, and was a programmer for a decade before all that.
