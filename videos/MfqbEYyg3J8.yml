description: "Get all the code: http://goo.gl/J3MtJ\n\nAs we continue to make an asteroid Java game, I show you how to make your space ship shoot.\n\nIt sounds like a simple concept until you realize the ship is shooting while it is rotating through space at an angle that may not be equal to the direction it is moving. Don't worry, we'll figure it out together in this and the next tutorial."
