description: "Take a FREE introductory instructor-led Live class at : http://www.edureka.co/android-development-certification-course\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nCustomization of ListView and GridView is explained in this tutorial.\n\nAndroid only shows a TextView item for each row in listview and connects an adapter to display data through these rows. You can change it very only by putting your own widget items inside the getView() method. This getView() method gets called for each row and returns the item to the listView.\n\nYou need to define the number of getView() method calls inside the getCount() method. Make sure you bind the data correctly otherwise you will receive a runtime exception.\n\nWatch complete video to see how it works.\n\n\nWatch all videos of this series - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9ooVrP1hQOGxsVIvgqd_TkPgDKQzhhO4\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nPlease write back to us at support@edureka.in or call us at +91-8880862004 for more information. \n\nhttp://www.edureka.co\n\nVisit - http://www.edureka.co/android-development-certification-course"
