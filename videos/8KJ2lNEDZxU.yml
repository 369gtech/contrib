title: 'Toward Low-Latency Java Applications'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433261240
description: "Increasingly Java is being used to build applications that come with low-latency requirements. To meet these tight latency requirements, developers have to understand any potential source of jitter so that their code does not rub them the wrong way. One traditional source of jitter is the stop-the-world pause that comes when a garbage collection brings all your application threads to a safe point. However, there are several things developers do to control GC frequency and duration. This session demonstrates the memory cost of using XML parsers such as SAX and compares that with low-latency alternatives.\n\n\nAuthors:\nJohn Davies\nJohn Davies is a veteran speaker on global-scale enterprise architectures and high performance computing.
