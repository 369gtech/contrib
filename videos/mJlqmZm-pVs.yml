description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io\_The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nDeep Dive: Kubernetes SIG Storage - Xing Yang, VMware & Michelle Au, Google \n\nKubernetes SIG Storage is responsible for ensuring that different types of file and block storage are available wherever a container is scheduled, storage capacity management (container ephemeral storage usage, volume resizing, etc.), influencing scheduling of containers based on storage (data gravity, availability, etc.), and generic operations on storage (snapshotting, etc.). In this session, we will deep dive into some projects that SIG Storage is currently working on, provide an update on the current status, and discuss what might be coming in the future. \n\nhttps://sched.co/cpBN"
