description: "A common perception of behavior-driven development (BDD) focuses on test automation with Cucumber-style  Given..When..Then  scenarios. But this is just the tip of the iceberg: in fact BDD ranges from requirements discovery and description through to driving technical design and implementation; helping testers focus their testing efforts more effectively; and even providing reliable, useful, and accurate technical documentation. This session discusses what BDD is about, its benefits, and how it affects development teams and processes. You will see how JVM teams can effectively implement BDD with tools such as JBehave, Cucumber, Thucydides, and Spock. Come learn how much more there is to BDD than just  Given..When..Then. \n\n\nAuthor:\nJohn Ferguson Smart\nJohn is a well-regarded consultant, coach, and trainer in technical agile practices.
