description: "Today, most artificial intelligence services have to send your data to the Cloud in order to perform the analysis. \nWith specific chipset capabilities, calculations can be done directly on the phone, with less risk of data getting leaked or hacked. \n\nFurthermore, AI apps tend to be real-time and mission-critical, any AI-use cases that enhance an experience canâ€™t afford latency. With on-device computation you can improve the performance of your app and resolve privacy and cost related issues. \n\nIn this session, I will show you how to use HiAI: a mobile computing platforms that make the developers able to run artificial intelligence algorithms on device."
