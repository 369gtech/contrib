description: "In late October, Strata+Hadoop World returns to the Big Apple. This year, we have a wide range of topics, from real-world case studies to hard-core data science to the ethics and challenges of a connected society.\n\nEach year, in the weeks leading up to Strata, we assemble a set of our hottest topics and most anticipated speakers, and ask them to join us for a free preview event. It'll give you a taste of what to expect in New York, and introduce you to new ideas in big data, ubiquitous computing, and ground-breaking interfaces that change how we live, love, work, and play.\n\nFor attendees, it's a chance to see what we're covering and decide on the can't-miss tracks you should attend; for everyone else, it's a chance to see what Strata is about and why you should attend. \n\nSpeakers: Alistair Croll, Ted Dunning, Claudia Perlich, Juliet Hougland, Jonathan Natkins, Amanda Gerdes, Jeffrey Heer."
