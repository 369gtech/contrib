description: "Python has quickly become THE language for network automation and programmability due to it’s combined simplicity and power.  Add to that the robust assortment of tools, libraries and modules related to networking available to “import\" and I doubt another language will take over the title anytime soon.  In this session we’ll explore some of the most useful libraries for network engineers and developers looking to interact with the network from a configuration and operational perspective.  Plenty of code will be shown, and all examples will be available to take away and leverage in your own environments.  \n\nThrough the session you'll learn how to leverage the tried and true interfaces of CLI and SNMP to manage your network before we jump up to newer options like NETCONF, RESTCONF and REST APIs.  We'll even explore full configuration management solutions and discuss when and how they should fit into your overall automation strategy.  \n\nSome of the great modules that will be covered include: \n\n* netmiko\n* PySNMP\n* ncclient\n* requests \n* Ansible \n* NAPALM\n\nEVENT:\n\nPyOhio 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nHank Preston\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPx77m4aZqs"
