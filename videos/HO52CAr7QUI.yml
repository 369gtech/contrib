description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nHomebrewing a Kubernetes Bootcamp: From College to K8s Support Engineer - Alice Wasko, Ambassador Labs\n\nAlice Wasko is a Support Engineer at Ambassador Labs who started her career not knowing anything about Kubernetes or the CNCF Landscape. In this talk Alice will share how she has learned about the many different cloud native topics that seemed overwhelming at first glance to someone without experience. Alice will also explain how she has taken part in helping to improve the learning and onboarding process for new hires and community members. Her “homebrewing” of a Kubernetes bootcamp has been both a great teaching tool and also a great learning tool. She aims to share her experience as a developer who recently learned Kubernetes and other technologies in the cloud ecosystem with others who are beginning their learning journey or are interested in educating others."
