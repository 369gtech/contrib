title: 'Tanzu.TV - Between Chair and Keyboard with Raju Gandhi'
language: English
recordingDate: 1608654992
description: 'Please join Nate Schutta and Raju Gandhi, a software craftsman with almost 20 years of hands-on experience scoping, architecting, designing, implementing full stack applications. He provides a 360 view of the development cycle, is proficient in a variety of programming languages and paradigms, experienced with software development methodologies, as well an expert in infrastructure and tooling. He has long been in the pursuit of hermeticism across the development stack by championing immutability during development (with languages like Clojure), deployment (leveraging tools like Docker and Kubernetes), and provisioning and configuration via code (toolkits like Ansible, Terraform, Packer, everything-as-code). Raju is a published author, internationally known public speaker and trainer. In his spare time, you will find Raju reading, playing with technology, or spending time with his wonderful (and significantly better) other half.'
