He worked on contributing to Node.js at college in his spare time, and now writes tutorials and articles for the Community.\n\nTierny talks to me about having a mindset of helping other developers grow. This is an attitude that I really admire. In software development, there is an upper limit of how much code that one brain and two hands can write, so the most valuable developers are the ones that spend a big chunk of their time focused outwards, helping other developers be the best that they can possibly be. Me and Tierny talks about why he loves working with documentation so much, the value of batching communication, how to delegate in open source projects, and how to be the leader of change in a big community.\n\nI am your host, MPJ, you are watching Fun Fun Function, and this is an developer discussion with Tierny Cyren."
