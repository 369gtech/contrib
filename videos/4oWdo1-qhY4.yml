description: "AskTHAT Live with Matthew Eng from Tap Swipe Click http://tapswipeclick.com/ - Product Research and Design\n\nMatthew is a Team Lead at IBM. My day-to-day work is guiding / motivating a small team of designers on IBM Cloud Platform, and help them navigate through a competitive Cloud industry and a huge megacorp as it seeks to transform itself. Before IBM, I worked at two startups, two agencies, one small company and one giant company (but less giant than Big Blue). All of this experience has given me the opportunity to work with super talented people and amazing clients such as AT&T, Alcatel-Lucent, Symantec, and Royal Bank of Canada.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/engmatthew\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/mattheweng\nhttp://tapswipeclick.com/\n\nLinks Mentioned in today's show:\n\n* Peter Sandberg - https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterinaustin/\n* Matthew Cunningham - https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewcunningham/\n* Seeing the Elephant: Defragmenting User Research - https://alistapart.com/…/seeing-the-elephant-defragmenting-…\n* The Craft of Research - http://amzn.to/2t0u5ax\n* Just Enough Research - http://amzn.to/2own24E"
