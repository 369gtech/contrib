title: 'YOW! Night 2018 with AWS - Roaan Vos - Atlassianâ€™s voyage with AWS Services'
language: English
recordingDate: 1524486289
description: 'Around 4 years ago, Atlassian started its voyage into developing solutions around and on top of AWS services. Various teams had been building their own stacks and processes, making the usual mess. A few proactive people in engineering services decided to clean some of it up by standardising on the 12 factor app and building the Micros platform to support it. This talk is about some of the challenges they faced and solved in getting 500+ developers building and deploying 700+ services to AWS, from managing the cloudformation stacks to automated database backups. The resulting solution enables developers to get a new service to staging in hours and into production inside a week, including all compliance and operational requirements.'
