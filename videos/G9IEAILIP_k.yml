description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM SF 19 http://bit.ly/2T3Do0U\n\nGet involved in Code Sync's next conference http://bit.ly/2Mcm4aS\n\n---\n\nTHE EVOLUTION OF A LANGUAGE\nby Andrea Leopardi\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nProgramming language\nCommunity\nHistory\n\nTALK LEVEL: Beginner\n\nABSTRACT\nElixir is young, but it's not as young as it used to be. The language has been stable for a long time now, but that doesn't mean it hasn't evolved. In this talk, I want to tell the story of how Elixir grew up to be what it is today. We'll talk about how the language changed to work better for the community, and how the community changed to write better Elixir. We'll try to guess at where this is all going next.\n\nRead the full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/andrea-leopardi/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - ANDREA LEOPARDI\nElixir core team member, developer advocate, software architect\n\nAndrea is a human born in the ancient lands of central Italy. He loves functional programming, beautiful code, and learning stuff. He's a software architect, speaker, and member of the core team of the Elixir programming language. His weak spot is having red hair.\n\nMore on Andrea Leopardi: https://codesync.global/speaker/andrea-leopardi/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM SF 19\nCode BEAM SF is powered by Code Sync.
