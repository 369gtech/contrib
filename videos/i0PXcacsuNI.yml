recordingDate: 1493216099
description: "As of Jan 6th, the Obama Administration Released a Major Update To Section 508. The Department of Justice is now interpreting the Americans with Disabilities Act in a way which has seen a dramatic increase in lawsuits in both the public and private sector because their websites are not accessible.\n\nIt is unclear what Trump will do with the Section 508 Refresh, but the Department of Justice precedent holds organizations legally responsible to meet Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 AA for both web and mobile sites.\n\nThis session will highlight what organizations need to know, and more importantly what web development companies should be informing their clients.\n\nFortunately for the community, this can be seen as pretty good news. Drupal 8, has been built and tested to include defaults that will make it as easy as possible to a site which complies. Little elements like requiring alt tags on images by default will make it easier for content creators to avoid the most common errors.\n\nThe costs of retrofitting a website to meet WCAG 2.0 AA standards can as much as it costs to build it.\n\nBy attending this presentation get an understanding of the Section 508 Refresh and WCAG 2.0 AA standards. You will also learn how Drupalâ€™s accessibility features will help your team."
