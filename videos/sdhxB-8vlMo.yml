Do you know which attacks you should be preparing your applications for? In this talk, we will cover the top 10 attacks on Node applications and how to handle all of them. Multiple tools will be covered, all of which have been used in production across different back-end architectures.\nA few of the areas that will be covered include securing dependencies, securing data, and securing your server. By the end of this talk, attendees should have a full security toolbox and they will know how to implement it quickly. This will help with production applications because you will still get through your sprints on time and you will be able to rest knowing you have security measures in place.\n\nThis event would not take place without the support of sponsors:\n\nPlatinum Sponsors\nFocus Reactive → https://focusreactive.com/\n\nGold Sponsors\nAWS Amplify → https://docs.amplify.aws/\nRetool → https://retool.com/\nEpsagon → https://epsagon.com/\nInfluxdata → https://www.influxdata.com/\nStackHawk → https://www.stackhawk.com/\nG2i → https://www.g2i.co/ \n\nSilver Sponsors\nAppSignal → https://appsignal.com/\nSailscasts → https://sailscasts.com/\n\nDiversity Sponsor\nPrisma → https://www.prisma.io/"
