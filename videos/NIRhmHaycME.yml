title: 'Invoke VBCS Business Object Endpoints using OAuth'
language: English
recordingDate: 1623830651
description: 'One nice thing about Visual Builder is that it helps you not only with the creation of the front end, but also with the creation of the backend for your app - through the use of the business objects feature. When you develop the UI in VB it is accessing the business objects through REST endpoints, and these REST endpoints can also be exposed so other UIs or systems can access the same data. You can use both Basic Auth and Bearer Token authentication mechanisms to invoke these REST endpoints.In this video, we will look at the setup required in order to invoke VBCS Business Object Endpoints using OAuth (Bearer Token).'
