description: "At monday.com, our product is built of lists with varying degrees of complexities. While scaling our infrastructure to handle millions of users worldwide, we were forced to dive into the core of lists to find creative solutions.\n\nWe want to demonstrate how we handle complex lists of items, and what challenges weâ€™ve tackled in terms of performance and modelling. We will cover DOM comparison algorithms, and how keys in React have a significant influence on performance. We'll explore the concept of windowing as a solution when lists become too large for the DOM to handle, and other advanced use-cases and solutions. All the examples will be backed up by performance measurement tools, methods, and results.\n\nSlides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ISpPKN2Ku6S7pPcVAtEnLY4kV2iojhNMrM9xxIv-2eQ/edit?usp=sharing"
