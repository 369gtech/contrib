description: "Erlang Factory SF Bay Area 2013\nMore info and slides on the website: http://www.erlang-factory.com/conference/SFBay2013/talks\n\nThis talk will cover the use of Erlang in the development of Neural Networks, and other types of evolving learning Universal Learning Network based intelligent agents. The talk will elaborate on why Erlang is a perfect fit for the development of distributed neural networks, the importance of Erlang's features to the field and future of Computational Intelligence, its role as the quintessential neural network programming language, and provide a case study of its use in the construction of distributed topology and parameter evolving universal learning network called DXNN."
