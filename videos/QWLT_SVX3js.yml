title: 'Alastair Smith - Software Craftsmanship for Startups'
language: English
recordingDate: 1501674912
description: "Alastair is a developer at Cloud Hub 360. While he enjoys writing C# on the back end and HTML/CSS/JavaScript on the front end, he’s tried a number of languages over the last decade and found his real interests lie in good coding practices and ensuring software quality with automated tests. He is the founder of the Cambridge Software Craftsmanship Community in the UK and a co-organiser of DDD East Anglia.\n\nAlastair has spoken at a number of user groups and regional community conferences around the UK, and more recently at ITAKE 2016 and SwanseaCon 2016. In 2015 I participated in the SQL in the City keynote.\n\nTalk summary \n\n“Startups don’t have time for that TDD nonsense!” “We might not be here in 3 months’ time, let’s just hack it in.” “There’s no point putting in that extra work because we might pivot – remember the YAGNI principle”\n\nStart-ups are fast-paced, thrilling, and exciting. They can also be highly pressured, with encouragement to cut corners to complete something faster. That encouragement is common in a number of development shops, but more accepted in start-ups when the very survival of the company is on the line. The XP practices adopted by the Software Craftsmanship movement such as TDD and CI/CD, rather than being something slowing down delivery, in fact can be the lifeblood for the continued success of a start-up.\n\nSince September 2016, I’ve been working for a start-up and have found the principles and practices of Software Craftsmanship more important than ever. We’ll look at how the perfect is the enemy of the good, how the easy is the enemy of the simple, and why “good” and “simple” are things start-ups really should be aiming for."
