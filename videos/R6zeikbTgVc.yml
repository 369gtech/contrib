description: "Documentation can make a big difference. Internal documentation can speed your team up and makes it easier for new engineers to get up and running. External documentation reduces time spent on support questions, and makes your product more usable.\n\nBut we often don't get round to writing documentation, because it's kind of a pain, and we don't know where to begin. So in this talk, I'll give a primer on writing effective documentation, and on helping your team to write docs too. Covering:\nWhat makes documentation useful\nHow to make it easier to get started\nHow to make writing clear and readable\n\nAbout Beth Aitman\nBeth Aitman is a technical writer at Google, where she works to improve developer experience for Site Reliability Engineers. Sheâ€™s interested in the intersection between UX and writing, and is passionate about teaching developers to write good docs. Outside of work, she likes to run around, climb rocks, and solve cryptic crosswords."
