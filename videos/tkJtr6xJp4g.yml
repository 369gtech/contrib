description: "From Velocity Amsterdam 2015: We spend countless hours thinking about software, code, performance, operations, infrastructure, and more. In this talk I’ll ask you to consider how thinking about thinking (your own and others) can have a substantial positive impact on all those things as well.\n\nAbout Courtney W. Nash (O'Reilly):\nCourtney Nash manages all Velocity-related content for O’Reilly Media. An erstwhile academic neuroscientist, she is still fascinated by the brain and how people learn just about anything. She’s been known to teach people how to Salsa dance, conduct psychology experiments, or even get air on a mountain bike. When not working on books, Courtney can be found biking, hiking, skiing, and photographing the Cascade Mountains near her home in Bellingham, Washington.\n\nWatch more from Velocity Amsterdam 2015: https://goo.gl/RjGAuw\nVisit the Velocity website: http://velocityconf.com/\nDon't miss an upload!
