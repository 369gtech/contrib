recordingDate: 1493320075
description: "Build complex displays of contentâ€”all without programming.\n\nViews was used on more than 80% of all Drupal 7 sites; now it is part of the Drupal 8 core.\n\nJoin in a father/daughter discussion about Views.\n\nLearn how to take full advantage of Views' power to create many amazing pages and blocks.\nUse filters to display only a relevant subset of your data.\nInstead of building 10 different view displays with different filters, learn how a contextual filter would require only a single display.\nUse relationships to combine data from several entities.\nUsing contributed modules, Views can turn your data into maps, carousels, and other unique displays.\nIn this session, we'll start by clarifying termininology.\nThen we'll modify a view built into core that everyone uses, the content page to create a custom content editor dashboard.\nFrom there, we'll build our own simple what's new content list.\nNext we'll expand and extend that list to create more complex displays, including maps and carousels.\nFinally we'll look at ways to make Views display exactly what you want in the format you want it.\n\nWhat You Will Learn\n\nCreate displays of content that are automatically updated when you add new content\nShow maps and rotating image carousels on your site\nUse fields from more than one content type to create powerful views of multi-table data\nModify the field data being displayed, combining it in different ways or changing the HTML that might be normally generated\nAdd headers and footers above and below a views display\nMake the output of your view look exactly like the designer specifies\nChange the order in which a list of content is displayed, limit the content shown to only certain content types or values\nFilter content using values passed to the view in the URL, making a single view work different ways"
