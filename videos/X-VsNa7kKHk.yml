recordingDate: 1556653509
description: "If you take a closer look into the DevOps toolbox, you will find plenty of projects written in Go: Docker, Kubernetes, Prometheus, to name just a few. Then there is a quite significant community around Go for microservices. But is Go really a good or even the best choice for those areas? Let’s explore the weal and woe of Go usage and find out about the actual reasons for Go’s success. You might be a bit surprised at first, but once you have understood why Go was made the way it is, it will all make sense.\n\nEVENT:\n\ncode::dive 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nBjörn Rabenstein\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nConference Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nConference YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU0Rt8VHO5-YNQXwIjkf-1g"
