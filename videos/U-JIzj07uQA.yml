This talk will describe the changes made, the performance tradeoffs and important semantics of Erlang's message passing. I will go through how all process signals worked before OTP 21, describe their shortcomings and present how it is implemented in OTP 21 to deal with the inherent scalability problems of the old solution.\n\nRead the full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/lukas-larsson/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - LUKAS LARSSON\nErlang VM Core Committer\n\nLukas first came in contact with Erlang 2004 while studying in GÃ¶teborg.
