description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nNetwork Service Mesh to Address Cloud Native 5G Telco Networking Challenges - Roshini Ratnam & Anders Franzen, Ericsson \n\nSome of the key networking challenges of cloud native telco applications are VPN/traffic separation, no NAT protocols, path diversity, accelerated user plane traffic, legacy protocol etc. Kubernetes networking cannot address them. Currently they are addressed using approaches like Multus, Danm, CNI-Genie. All this still only works on a node level but will require a substantial amount of complex case specific, on-site DevOps to bottom-up build a functional multi-network cluster, with all challenges that come with that, like LCM. This seminar will cover how Network Service Mesh (NSM) can address networking challenges of cloud native telco applications in 5G with the details of proof of concept and how NSM decouple infrastructure from applications. The speakers will also give details of the ongoing work with CNF test bed network separation use case.\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zelt"
