description: "Marcel Pinto, Lead Android Developer, HERE Technologies\n\nABSTRACTING THE MAP\nIntermediate / Android Architecture / Talk\n\n\nA while back my PO came to me and said: “Hey! we've got a new map provider, let’s change it”. Panic mode! At the time I was dealing with a legacy app where the Map implementation was everywhere! Every developer eventually faces situations like this one, but not only that, dealing with maps sometimes can get messy and complex. After years dealing with those issues, with new architecture and pattern concepts we can properly abstract the Map, so when your PO says “Let’s change the full Map” you can just say “no problem, give me a minute!” I will try to solve questions like: “In which layer does the Map implementation goes?” “How can we abstract the map from our business logic?” “How to deal with Map Objects and camera updates?” Among other key concepts that will help you deal with Maps in your Android apps."
