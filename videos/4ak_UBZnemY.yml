description: "RubyConf 2018 - What poker can teach us about post-mortems by Cory Chamblin\n\nAre your post-mortems reactive and unsatisfying?\n\nThe common post-mortem traces bad outcomes back to critical decisions so that we make different decisions in the future. But what if those decisions were sound? It tells us to stop making them!\n\nIn poker, as in software, variance is real and you can do everything correctly and still lose the hand.\n\nIn this talk, we'll talk about real post-mortems and problems with their conclusions. We'll rebalance our thinking to see when we might be learning the wrong lessons. We will learn about poker, taking risks, and a little about life."
