description: "https://media.ccc.de/v/ASG2019-165-bmc-management-with-bmc-toolbox\n\n\n\nThis talk is about the bmc-toolbox, an open-source project that leverages the _Baseboard Management Controller_ (iLOs iDracs and similar)  to help manage a large fleet (&gt50K) of bare metal servers at Booking.com\n\n[bmc-toolbox.github.io](https://bmc-toolbox.github.io/)\n\nIts goal is to provide vendor agnostic tooling to manage the lifecycle of bare metal servers,\nthis talk describes the tools part of bmc-toolbox and various aspects of managing a large fleet of bare metal servers.\n\nThe bmc-toolbox leverages the _Baseboard Management Controller_ to help manage the lifecycle of datacenter bare metal.  It provides vendor agnostic tools and a library in Go lang to *inventorize*, *configure*, *manage**, **update* a large fleet of bare metal assets with the help of the BMC.\n\n- *bmclib* - A Go lang library that provides a consistent set of methods to interface with BMCs.                                                                                                                   \n- *dora* - tool to **inventorize** a fleet of bare metal servers and chassis assets.                                                                                                                               \n- *bmcbutler* - tool to handle **configuration management**  for a fleet of bare metal server and chassis BMCs.                                                                                                    \n- *actor* - A single **API webservice** endpoint to interact with a fleet of bare metal BMCs.                                                                                                                      \n- *bmcldap* - LDAP based **authentication/authorization** service/proxy for BMCs.                                                                                                                                  \n- *bmcfwupd* - tool to **update** the BMC firmware.\n\nThis talk covers,\n- The challenges managing the provisioning and lifecycle of a *not yet hyperscale* size set of bare metal servers.\n- The purpose of the tools included of bmc-toolbox, how they help make our lives easier\n- How the tooling interacts with the BMCs (vendor specific APIs, Redfish)\n- The current state of Redfish in the wild\n\nJoel Rebello Juliano Martinez\n\nhttps://cfp.all-systems-go.io/ASG2019/talk/7WMKLH/"
