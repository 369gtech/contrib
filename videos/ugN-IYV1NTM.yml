It then moves on to a very basic example that you can follow along with. As the video progresses, you will dive into more and more realistic examples. This guide will prepare you for the real world usage of source control, specifically git.\n\nTypically git is used to protect code but this video does not utilize code or code tools in order to keep the example as simple as possible and so that the beginner users will not get confused as to what is git and what is the code.\n\nThe basic git commands will be explained and demonstrated. While a few gui tools will be identified, the primary tool of this video is git bash because it is what git was designed for and it is what everyone has."
