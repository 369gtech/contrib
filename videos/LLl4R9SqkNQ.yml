description: "Lightning Talk: Multi-Buildpack Hacks - Topher Bullock, Pivotal\n\nAre you feeling restricted by having to choose only *ONE* buildpack to compile a droplet for your app? Looking to run more than just a boring single-language app on CF? Want to deploy a binary that uses a virtual X Window server then stream that virtual display to Twitch? \n\nTopher will be your guide into the wonderful world that multi-buildpack support unlocks, and show how you can use the CloudFoundry Incubator project to make all of your droplet dreams come true! Attendees will learn how to compose together multiple buildpacks on a single staging container, and use this new power for fun, and (maybe) profit.\n\nAbout Topher Bullock\nTopher is a senior software engineer at Pivotal and is based out of the Toronto, Canada office. On the Pivotal Cloud R&D team he has experience working on distributed systems, infrastructure automation, Concourse, Cloud Foundry, Service Broker APIs, and Mobile Apps. Topher was recently selected as one of Canada's Software Developer Top 30 Under 30."
