description: "RubyHACK 2018: Ruby Web Application Security Defense in Depth by Jeremy Evans\n\nHow bad a shape would you be in if an attacker was able to exploit a remote code execution vulnerability in your web application? When designing web applications that deal with confidential information, you should have a plan to limit your exposure when vulnerabilities are exploited. This presentation will discuss many ways to add defense in depth to your ruby web applications, including separate database users, file system access limiting, system call filtering, privilege dropping, child process re-execution, and memory protection, with lessons learned from production deployments."
