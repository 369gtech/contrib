title: 'The Netflix Domain Graph Service framework - OSS GraphQL for Spring Boot by Paul Bakker'
recordingDate: 1621186930
description: "Netflix has developed a GraphQL framework for Spring Boot over the last 1.5 years. We recently decided to open source this project, and aim to be the best way to implement GraphQL servers in Java. The framework is focussed on a great developer experience, while it’s also battle tested by Netflix.\n\nThe talk starts with an introduction to GraphQL; how to create a schema and how to run queries and mutations. We’ll also go into the benefits compared to REST.\n\nThe remainder of the talk goes into using the DGS framework to implement a GraphQL server with Spring Boot. The format of the talk is very developer focussed, showing the code to get a GraphQL service running, including tests. We’ll also talk about plugging in things like metrics, tracing and logging.\n\nDuring the talk we’ll talk about how Netflix is using GraphQL and how we’ve found it to be useful.\n\nPaul Bakker, Netflix\n\nPresented at Jfokus conference 9th February 2021.\nhttps://www.jfokus.se"
