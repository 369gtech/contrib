title: 'Berta Devant | The fake problem with hiring juniors | Codemotion Madrid 2018'
language: English
recordingDate: 1580980212
description: 'There is a common misconception that junior developers are a burden and wonâ€™t be delivering value for the first months or even years. Yet, observing my own contributions, I realised how my insights were useful for my team from day one. Working with agile methodologies, using pair programming and code review, you can contribute to your team, deliver value and learn on the job. In this talk I will try to explain why hiring Juniors makes business sense for your company and/or team and how to properly get the most out of every team member no matter their level of experience.'
