description: "With news every day about companies having sensitive data stolen, isn't it about time you make sure that you won't be next on the list?\n\nIn this session, we will use Consul and Vault to configure a .NET application in a secure, traceable, repeatable, and scalable manner. We will cover:\n\n* How to use secret storage for sensitive configuration\n* How to test, deploy, and react to configuration changes\n* How to generate temporary credentials for a database\n* When you might want to use alternatives to Vault and Consul\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks, courses, and conferences in the following links:\nhttps://ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
