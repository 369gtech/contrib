title: 'GitOps - Using Git as your source of truth for build, deploy and observability - Alexis Richardson'
recordingDate: 1518957183
description: "More and more businesses are facing challenges with current release management and traditional operations in the era of delivery velocity and quality. How can Developers adapt to the “speed of business”? In this session, Alexis will discuss these challenges, including current trends in CICD and how they’re converging with operations and monitoring. You’ll be introduced to a new principle called “GitOps” - an agile software lifecycle for modern applications.\n\nAt Weaveworks, we implement this principle in our product, Weave Cloud. This not only helps customers ship applications faster, it also helps them run their own cloud native stack. Alexis will explain what cloud native is and why you should care, share some real world examples of cloud native technologies in production, identify tried and tested best practices and tools, and leave you feeling inspired to create your own cloud-native stack!"
