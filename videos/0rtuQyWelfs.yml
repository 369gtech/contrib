recordingDate: 1541257469
description: 'The session starts with an introduction to DSL related Kotlin language features. Next, we create a simple DSL in a live coding session and then continue adding expressiveness and language features. We cover a number of examples, like JSON or XML builder’s, data binding, configuration & template engines. As a bonus, if time permits, we’ll take a look at Kotlin DSL example in TeamCity continuous integration server.'
