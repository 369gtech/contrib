description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2015.\nSpeakers: Stephane Maldini, Rossen Stoyanchev\nWeb / Javascript track\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/reactive-web-applications-53170985\nIn our previous talk \"Intro to Reactive Programming\" (located here: https://www.youtube.com/edit?o=U&video_id=fec9nEIybp0) we defined reactive programming and provided details around key initiatives such as Reactive Streams and ReactiveX. In this talk we'll focus on where we are today with building reactive web applications. We'll take a look at the choice of runtimes, how Reactive Streams may be applied to network I/O, and what the programming model may look like. While this is a forward looking talk, we'll spend plenty of time demoing code built with with back-pressure ready libraries available today."
