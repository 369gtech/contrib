description: "Speaker(s):\nGlen Keane, Johnny Lee, Paul Eremenko, Regina Dugan\n\nDescription:\nThis summer Project Tango launches. On a rocket. To space. Project Tango's Android smart-phone-like device is scheduled to fly 230 miles above the earth. It will construct a 3D-map of the International Space Station and enable autonomous navigation of a floating robotic platform. The goal: Create a robotic assistant for astronauts. And our earthling activities? Augmented reality, architecture, retail, gaming. We're harnessing 10 years of advances in computer vision and robotics to build perhaps one of the most powerful mobile devices ever made. One with human-scale understanding of space and motion. Epic.\n120 countries, 6,827 developers on line, 48,486 module developer kits downloaded. For the first developer's conference. Project Ara asks how we bring the benefits of an open hardware ecosystem to 6B people. It's physical. We want to do for hardware what open platforms have done for software... create a vibrant third-party developer ecosystem, lower the barrier to entry, increase the pace of innovation, and compress development timelines.  \nFrom imaging and authentication to a new creative canvas that powers mobile storytelling. Universities to large scale manufacturers. Your garage to zero g.  \nDiversity. Scale. Speed. Google's Advanced Technology and Projects group. ATAP. A small band of pirates who believe the future is what we choose to make. And that we choose to make what we believe in. We believe the future is awesome. We can build it faster together. ATAP + developers = some epic sh*t.\n\nWatch all Google I/O 2014 videos at: g.co/io14videos"
