description: "Speaker: Sayanee Basu, Technology Consultant, Ricoh Singapore\n\nAs the era of tiny low-powered connected sensors beckons, how can Ruby and Rails developers come to play a pivotal role? In this talk, we will explore the backend functionalities and features that a connected sensor will talk to and make sense of the data collected. Through the open source Rails-based framework ThingSpeak, we will explore the 3 key features such a platform requires and give practical hardware demos and code snippets. Audience participation is all welcome! So hey, let's explore and make sense together!\n\nSpeaker's Bio\nSayanee is an engineer with a focus on electronics and web technologies. She curates the developer and design community of Singapore through We Build SG and creates screencasts on developer tools with Build Podcast. At other times, she enjoys a good workout, reading her eBooks and slowly drinking some tea.\n\nEvent Page: http://www.reddotrubyconf.com\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/ONqN/"
