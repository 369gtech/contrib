title: 'Let''s Go Build a Bot (Bonus Part 2/4)'
recordingDate: 1612987571
description: "In January, our #WednesdayStreams returned with \"Let's Go Build a Bot\" and your host Dom Davis!\n\nWe explored the GoLang programming language, using Docker to containerise the service and then Amazon's AWS ECR, ECS & Fargate to get each Docker tag deployed.\n\nThis Bot is a nor(DEV): project, designed to replace the current \"dumb\" implementation - it will provide event marketing, interaction, and a StackOverflow-esque Q&A service on our Discord.\n\nSo, we return in February to see how far we can get. This year we're going to host a range of streams and events around this Bot! Keep those eye peeled and why not get involved? Wanna build a part of the hive mind? A discreet micro-service? The mobile app? Some ML? Give us a shout!\n\n[...]\n\n---\n\n## About your Host\n\nDom Davis is a veteran of The City and a casualty of The Financial Crisis. Not content with bringing the world to its knees he then went off to help break the internet before winding up in Norfolk where he messes about doing development and devops. Dom has been writing code since his childhood sometime in the last millennium â€“ he hopes some day to become good at it.\n\nDom is an enthusiastic and impassioned speaker [read: he gabbles] who uses a blend of irreverent sarcasm and flippant humour to bring complex subjects to a broad audience. Whether or not they understand him is up for debate, but he likes to believe they do.\n\n---\n\n## About Norfolk Developers\n\nYou might want to try something new or wish to take your software development up to the next level. We want to jump into the detail and bring you practical value.
