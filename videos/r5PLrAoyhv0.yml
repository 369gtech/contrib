description: "Filmed at https://2018.dotcss.io on November 8th in Paris. More talks on https://dotconferences.com/talks\n\nFlorian goes over a set of confusingly named properties and values from the css-text-3 specification (https://drafts.csswg.org/css-text-3/) that control what happens to white spaces when laying out text, and how line breaking works. He explains the logic of the system, different ways the properties can be used to achieve various results, and looks into some of the complication caused by incomplete implementations."
