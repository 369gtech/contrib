description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2014\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nCliff Click - CTO at 0xdata\n\nABSTRACT\nWe have built an open-source platform for dealing with in-memory distributed data. We've used it to built state-of-the-art predictive modeling and analytics (e.g. GLM & Logistic Regression, GBM, Random Forest, Neural Nets, PCA to name a few) that's 1000x faster than the disk-bound alternatives, and 100x faster than R (we love R but it's tooo slow on big data!). We can run R expressions on tera-scale datasets, or munge data from Scala & Python. We're building our newest algorithms in a few weeks, start to finish, because the platform makes Big Math easy. We routinely test on 100G datasets, have customers using 1T datasets.\n\nThis talk is about the platform, coding style & API that lets us seamlessly deal with datasets from 1K to 1TB without changing a line of code, lets us use clusters ranging from your laptop to 100 server clusters with many many TB of ram and hundreds of CPUs.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
