description: "Ближайшая конференция — HolyJS 2020 Piter\n22-25 июня, Online\nПодробности и билеты: https://bit.ly/hollyJS2020\n\n\n\n\n. This talk will provide an overview of the WebKit open source Javascript virtual machine called JavaScriptCore. It will cover how JavaScriptCore transforms JS source into bytecode, and then executes that bytecode using various tiers in the engine. The talk will provide details on the four tiers that execute JS, the purpose of each tier and how code execution moves between those tiers. We’ll also cover how we execute JavaScript, a dynamically typed language, in an optimal way using techniques like speculation, static analysis and profiling.\n\nIf you are curious as to what happens when your code executes and the transformations done to make your code perform well, you don’t want to miss this talk."
