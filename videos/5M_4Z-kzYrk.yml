description: "Service Broker Integration with Kubernetes Operators - Julian Fischer, anynines GmbH\n\nCloud Foundry can be run on top of or alongside Kubernetes. Simultaneously, Kubernetes becomes more popular for automating data services and in particular the operator pattern is applied frequently. In this talk you will get a brief introduction into the operator pattern and how it works. Furthermore, it will be discussed how operators can be integrated with Cloud Foundry using Service Brokers. After this talk you will have a conceptual understanding of operators and how they might fit into your Cloud Foundry marketplace."
