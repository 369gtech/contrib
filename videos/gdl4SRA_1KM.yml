description: "Alex Zharichenko presents on Building the Pitt API with Python.\n\nHaving access to data allows people to gain knowledge and build tools. We'll take you through the journey of building the PittAPI, a way to give developers an easy, programmatic way to access campus and campus-related data in a simple API. The end goal of the API is to deprecate itself in the hopes that Pitt (and other colleges) will provide a first-class way to obtain useful data themselves. Built on BeautifulSoup, Requests & Gevent, you can find the PittAPI at https://github.com/Pitt-CSC/PittAPI"
