From Function Template Argument Deduction in C++98, to `auto` in C++11, to generic lambdas in C++14, to Class Template Argument Deduction in C++17, to the high-profile introduction of Concepts in C++20, it is something every programmer now needs to understand, not just as individual features but as a coherent whole. Unfortunately, since inference has arrived piecemeal into C++, the big picture of how to program with it is often lost. Worse yet, idioms that used to be usable, like \"almost always auto,\" are simply wrong in C++20.\n\nIn this talk, I will show how these seemingly individual features can combine in amazing ways in C++ 20 for best practices that can make your code more powerful, more performant, more maintainable and more understandable. I will illustrate these with nuts and bolts examples like how common code that used to take dozens of machine instructions can now use inference to run in a single instruction. By the end of the talk, I hope you will come out with not just a new understanding of this wondrous evolution but the skills and confidence to safely make the most of it\n— \nMichael Spertus\nSymantec\nFellow\nMike Spertus is a Fellow/VP at Symantec where he serves as Chief Scientist for Cybersecurity Services, an Adjunct Professor of Computer Science at the University of Chicago, where he teaches Advanced C++ and Big Data in the Masters Program in Computer Science, and a long-time member of the C++ Standards Committee, where he is submitted over 50 proposals, several of which are now parts of the C++ language. He feels fortunate to not only be able to spend time on C++ in all three roles but as one of his favorite hobbies as well.\n\nAt CPPCon 2017, his poster on Class Template Argument Deduction Best Practices won Best Poster award\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
