description: "As our codebase grows, so its complexity does. Code it’s becoming harder to read, test, debug, maintain… such a mess! Let’s go back to the cool ’80s and start a journey to discover a different way to approach software development: Functional Programming. We’ll see how FP can actually save hours of debugging and improve our productivity while writing a complex frontend JavaScript application or a huge backend distributed system in any programming language. You’ll never write an impure function again!\n\nAbout:\n\nMichele Riva, Sr. Software Engineer - Openmind\n\nMichele discovered his passion for software development building an app to make funny jokes about his friends... and professors. Today, \"fun\" and \"development\" are still part of his life while working as a Software Engineer at openmind and contributing to some of the biggest OpenSource projects from different companies (Facebook, Apache, Node.js Foundation) in different programming languages (Haskell, Erlang, Go, Node). He strongly believes in shared knowledge, and he writes tons of public domain articles about JavaScript, Functional Programming and performance enhancements on jsmonday.dev."
