description: "Are you interested in writing clojure.spec annotations but are put off by spec’s intricate syntax or the prospect of reverse-engineering code and documentation? I’ll teach you how to automate most of this work with a new tool that uses runtime observations to generate useful specs for any project.\n\nWe’ll take entire namespaces from popular projects and generate specs that are compact enough to be readable, but detailed and specific enough to offer clear insights into the code. We’ll also discuss how the tool works, and show how to use it with both its easy Leiningen plugin and simple REPL-compatible API.\n\nYou will learn how to automatically generate specs for your own projects, getting you off the ground and enjoying the benefits of spec quickly and easily."
