Exceptions are the politically correct means to signal errors in C++, but many applications still resort to error codes for reasons related to ease of understanding, ease of handling errors locally, and efficiency of generated code. \n\nThis talk shows how a variety of theoretical and practical artifacts can be combined together to address error codes and exceptions in one wholesome, simple package. The generic type expected?T? can be used for both local (error-code-style) and centralized (exception-style) manners, drawing from the strengths of each.\n— \n\nAndrei Alexandrescu, The D Language Foundation\nVice President\n\nAndrei Alexandrescu is a researcher, software engineer, and author. He wrote three best-selling books on programming (Modern C++ Design, C++ Coding Standards, and The D Programming Language) and numerous articles and papers on wide-ranging topics from programming to language design to Machine Learning to Natural Language Processing. Andrei holds a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Washington and a BSc in Electrical Engineering from University \"Politehnica\" Bucharest.
