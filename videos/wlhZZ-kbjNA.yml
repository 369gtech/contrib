description: "New libraries such as TensorFlow.js (js.tensorflow.org) are powerful tools for utilizing machine learning in JavaScript. However, their capabilities extend beyond machine learning. In this talk, Dominic Kramer will be demonstrating how these libraries are making JavaScript an awesome platform for mathematics and scientific computing in areas beyond machine learning by showing concrete examples of using the libraries to explore other interesting areas of mathematics.\n\nEVENT:\n\nNode Interactive 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nDominic Kramer, Google\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nLinux Foundation provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nNodeJS YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQPYJluYC_sn_Qz_XE-YbTQ"
