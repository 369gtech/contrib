title: 'A better approach for testing microservices: introducing test kits in practice (Maxim Novak, Israel)'
recordingDate: 1515769374
description: "Micro-services are the new black; everyone is using them. Alas, when your system is composed of many micro-services, testing becomes more challenging. The straight-forward approach for E2E testing no longer suffices and for integration tests it doesnâ€™t even exist. A better way to test in this kind of an environment would be to work with a test kit of the micro-service you are interacting with.\n\nBy the end of this talk, you will learn how to create a test-kit that covers your micro-service. Testing this way will grant you a much higher level of confidence, and will portray a more accurate picture of your assumptions vs. reality. Overall it will make any integration between micro-services easier, thus benefit your colleagues and make your company progress faster."
