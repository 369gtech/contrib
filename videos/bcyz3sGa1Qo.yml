description: "Google I/O 2010 - Testing techniques for Google App Engine \r\n\r\nApp Engine 201 \r\n\r\nMax Ross \r\n\r\nWe typically write tests assuming that our development stack closely resembles our production stack. What if our target environment only lives in the cloud?  We will highlight the key differences between typical testing techniques and Google App Engine testing techniques. We will also present concrete strategies for testing against local and cloud-based implementations of App Engine services. Finally, we will explain how to use App Engine as a highly parallel test harness that runs existing test suites without modification. \r\n\r\nFor all I/O 2010 sessions, please go to code.google.com/events/io/2010/sessions.html"
