description: "On the face of it, Android Wear and the Apple Watch are very similar: they’re both wristwatches, they’re both closely tied to your phone, and the tech media are unaccountably excited about both of them. But how do their differences affect you as a developer? This session explores what it takes to design and consider the same application for the two most prominent wearable platforms in existence today.\n\nIn this talk, you’ll learn how to build and design a great application for both platforms. You’ll learn about:\n\n* The design patterns that Apple Watch and Android Wear (and to a lesser extent, other platforms like Pebble) share\n* The design patterns that they don’t share\n* How to think about multiple same-but-different design patterns for same-but-different hardware at the same time\n* Finding the common ground in your ideas and design\n\nThis design-focused session will explore what it means to be a watch app, and discuss how a “watch app” is not the same as a “mobile app”\n\nJon Manning is a world renowned iOS development trainer and writer, game designer and mobile software engineering wizard.\n\nHe has co-authored two books on mobile development and enjoys re-implementing such things as OpenGL and the Objective-C runtime (in his spare time).\n\nJon is also a researcher in Human-Computer Interaction working towards a PhD.\n\nParis Buttfield-Addison is a developer and designer specialising in game design, development, and playful user experiences. He has written more than ten books, including “Swift Development with Cocoa (O’Reilly Media, 2014), and the upcoming “Mobile Game Development with Unity” (O’Reilly Media, 2015). Paris co-founded Secret Lab together with Jon Manning, and has worked with clients including the ABC, Apple, CSIRO, Meebo (acquired by Google), the National Museum of Australia, and Study Ladder.\n\nParis has a BA in History, and a PhD in Computing, and lives on the side of a mountain in Hobart, Tasmania, Australia.\n\nFor more on YOW!
