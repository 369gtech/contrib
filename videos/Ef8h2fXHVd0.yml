He'll explain the applications for each tool, how to best leverage them for finding bugs, and common challenges in the domain. We'll explore tools in Go, Rust, Java, and more, talking about alternatives for your ecosystem along the way.\n\nThough these tools are typically used by developers, QA professionals of all types will benefit from learning more about these tools and how they can be applied in an overall test strategy."
