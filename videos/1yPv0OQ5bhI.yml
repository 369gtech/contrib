Titzer (Google), Benedikt Meurer (v8), Lukas Taegert-Atkinson (RollupJS), Dan Ehrenberg (TC39). Some representatives who have been actively participating in the #DeepTrack program. Now on stage, they are sharing innovative ideas, discussions, and approaches from the DeepTrack 2019.\n\nA special thanks goes to Wolfram Kriesing for anchoring and guiding the whole process, not only on stage but especially in the 2-day DeepTrack itself.\n\nThe DeepTrack is all about sharing knowledge, discussing and working on all kinds of topics around JavaScript and having fun with like-minded people in a safe environment where YOU create the program! The overall idea is to have a creative space, to share ideas, work together, discuss and listen to each other â€” face to face.\n\nSome of 2019's topics were:\n- decorators\n- value types\n- HTML and CSS loading\n- top-level await\n- async modules\n- import await\n- key-value storage\n- import Maps\n- official announcement of threads in WASM\n- webassembly and JavaScript working better together\n\nThe #DeepTrack 2020 is looking for your contribution: This is not a CFP, everybody from the community who owns a ticket has the opportunity to contribute to the #DeepTrack.
