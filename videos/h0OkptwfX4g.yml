description: "Google Tech Talks\nApril 18, 2007\n\nABSTRACT\n\nAdvanced Topics in Programming Languages Series: Parametric Polymorphism and the Girard-Reynolds Isomorphism.  This talk is based on a series of papers by Philip Wadler, a principal designer of the Haskell programming language. Featured are a number of double-barreled names in computer science:\n\n* Hindley-Milner (Strong typing without having to type the types)\n* Wadler-Blott (Making ad-hoc polymorphism less ad-hoc with parametricity)\n* Curry-Howard (Isomorphism between types and theorems, terms and proofs)\n* Girard-Reynolds (Isomorphism between types and terms in the presence of parametricity)\n\nThe talk will conclude with a programming technique..."
