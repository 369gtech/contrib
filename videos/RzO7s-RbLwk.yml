title: 'A linear algebra library for C++23 - Guy Davidson [C++ on Sea 2019]'
language: English
recordingDate: 1550417720
description: "There is a gaping hole in the standard library: algebraic vector and matrix types. This talk will cover the proposal that aims to plug that hole, describing Linear Algebra and its uses, the proposed API, and what may come next, with a minimum of moaning about the identifier \"vector\".\n---\nGuy has worked in the Total War franchise for Creative Assembly for nearly 20 years. He is the Principal Coding Manager and enjoys turning good coders into great coders. He is also an ISO C++ Committee voting member.\n\nhttps://cpponsea.uk/sessions/a-linear-algebra-library-for-cpp23.html\n\nFilmed and Edited by Digital Medium Ltd: https://events.digital-medium.co.uk\nEnquiries: events@digital-medium.co.uk"
