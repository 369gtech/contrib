description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2012.\nPresenter: Emil Eifrem\nGraphs are everywhere. From websites adding social capabilities to Telcos providing personalized customer services, to innovative bioinformatics research, organizations are adopting graph databases as the best way to model and query connected data. If you can whiteboard, you can model your domain in a graph database.\n\nIn this session Emil Eifrem provides a close look at the graph model and offers best use cases for effective, cost-efficient data storage and accessibility.\n\nTake Aways: Understand the model of a graph database and how it compares to document and relational databases Understand why graph databases are best suited for the storage, mapping and querying of connected data\n\nEmil's presentation will be followed by a Hands-on Guide to Spring Data Neo4j. Spring Data Neo4j provides straightforward object persistence into the Neo4j graph database. Conceived by Rod Johnson and Neo Technology CEO Emil Eifrem, it is the founding project of the Spring Data effort. The library leverages a tight integration with the Spring Framework and the Spring Data infrastructure. Besides the easy to use object graph mapping it offers the powerful graph manipulation and query capabilities of Neo4j with a convenient API.\n\nThe talk introduces the different aspects of Spring Data Neo4j and shows applications in several example domains.\n\nDuring the session we walk through the creation of a engaging sample application that starts with the setup and annotating the domain objects. We see the usage of Neo4jTemplate and the powerful repository abstraction. After deploying the application to a cloud PaaS we execute some interesting query use-cases on the collected data."
