description: 'It''s perhaps no surprise that the first value from the Agile Manifesto is "Individuals and interactions over processes and tools" - it is almost always the case that ultimately the difference between a software project succeeding or failing is the quality of communication between the individuals involved. But how can we improve these interactions? In this talk Leo & Sarah take a look at how empathy can help change how we communicate with our colleagues and clients, and see how frameworks like Non-Violent Communication can help us put some of the ideas we''ll be discussing into practical use. This talk was given at a Pivotal Lunch & Learn in London on 6 December 2017.'
