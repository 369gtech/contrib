recordingDate: 1576714035
description: 'This talk presents the methodology, findings and conclusions of a boundary theory based Information Systems research project completed at University College Cork, Ireland. Perspectives of privacy have been analyzed from five key social worlds within the blockchain industry (users, regulators, cryptographic researchers, corporate architects, and protocol developers) through semi-structured interviews, conducted in 2018. The study attempts to distinguish the similarities and differences that exist between interdependent groups of agents. Communicating benign and internecine perspectives, ideologies, and approaches to the development of privacy enhancing technologies is viewed as method through which conflict and division may be mitigated against as the industry evolves further into the 21st century.'
