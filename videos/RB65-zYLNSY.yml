description: "The realities of scientific research involve grappling with a data landscape marred by shifting data, gatekeepers, heterogeneous storage patterns, and tribal knowledge. Unfortunately, designing solutions that disseminate research data easily and effectively is frequently an afterthought. Clojure to the rescue! This talk details the composition of a variety of open source Clojure libraries to make research data available to a wide community of research scientists\n\nJennifer has found her niche translating the babblespeak of scientists at a national research lab into modern software development solutions. Fueled by copious amounts of tea, she spent many years battling object-oriented languages (Java, C++) before discovering Clojure. Since that discovery, she has become the resident Clojure evangelist in her group, promoting ways to leverage the full Clojure ecosystem to support scientific research needs."
