title: 'Paul Fremantle - Ballerina (hands-on session)'
recordingDate: 1557964560
description: "Cloud native programming inherently involves working with remote endpoints: microservices, serverless, APIs, WebSockets, SaaS apps and more. Ballerina is a new programming language that is designed to bring code-first agility to the challenge of integrating across endpoints. Ballerina has first-class support for distributed transactions, circuit-breakers, stream processing, data-access, JSON, XML, gRPC and many other integration challenges. It deploys directly onto Docker and Kubernetes. It integrates with common IDEs including IntelliJ and Visual Studio Code.\r\n\r\nIn this talk Paul will explore Ballerina features and development - most of the talk will be a live demo together with some discussion of the motivation for creating a new programming language and the design inspirations. You can find out more on at https://ballerina.io - Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/channel/keJX6dzr85d with the Ustream Mobile App"
