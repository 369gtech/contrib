title: '#HITBCyberWeek #CommSec D2 - Enterprise Security Strategy Leveraging On Zero Trust Approach'

recordingDate: 1607985782
description: "Gone are the days where a firewall-based perimeter is sufficient to protect your enterprise’s virtual assets. Having a strong outer shell and a weak inner belly has always been a security design flaw steeped in the tradition of castles and moots from the medieval ages where the city of Troy was taken by the Greek using a Trojan Horse in just 1 night after a futile year-long siege of the city. The Jericho Forum in 2003 advocated a new security concept to de-parameterized defense and build an architecture emphasizing on role-based security with defense-in-depth. Subsequently Cloud Security Alliance inherited this where we drove software defined perimeter in the cloud to what we shall talking today, Zero Trust.\n\nIn this presentation, I shall talk about Zero Trust and the premise behind this initiative and how we can help you inspire your Zero Trust plan.\n\n=== \n\nAloysius is currently the Chief Security Officer of Huawei UAE responsible for driving the Company’s cybersecurity vision of building a safe and secure intelligent connected digital world in the UAE and the region. He is currently a Board Director for US-based (ISC)2, as well as UK-based cyber leadership think tank, the Centre for Strategic Cyberspace + International Studies (CSCIS). In his career spanning 20 years, Aloysius was a Co-Founder / Managing Director for Cloud Security Alliance Asia Pacific (CSA) and Chief Standards Officer for CSA globally. Prior the CSA, he was the Worldwide Head of Security for Vodafone Global Enterprise and a Security Practice Leader with PricewaterhouseCoopers Singapore, having started his career with DSO National Laboratories in Singapore focusing on Defence R&D."
