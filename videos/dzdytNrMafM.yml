description: "No Rocket Scientist Required - Developing +14,000 Message p/second IOT Systems - Dale Robinson, Arity LLC.    \n\nAnchoring the team tasked with developing a high throughput REST system for the Arity IOT platform, Dale Robinson has faced many of the common frustrations such an endeavour inevitably presents. This talk hopes to help fellow developers avoid the pitfalls and highlight the tools that helped deliver a working solution for Arity. Using Java and open source software like JMeter, RabbitMq and Spring Boot, Dale discusses ways to peek inside running containers, how breaking a monolith application into micro-services improved performance and Dales experiences of SDD (Security Driven Development - a personal term born from traumatic experiences) on team velocity.\n\nUsing Cloud Foundry instead of traditional JEE architecture, Arity has enabled its developers to deliver scalable applications with ease and made the nightmare of 4 a.m. deploys part of history.\n\nDale Robinson\nArity LLC.\nAnchor Developer\nU.K.\nDale Robinson is the Anchor for the A_SIX Project within Arity. Dale serves as an internal subject matter expert using Java technologies deployed on the Cloud Foundry Platform.
