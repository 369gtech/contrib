Using two recent migrations as examples she will walk through what went wrong, what went right, the patterns such projects follow, and how you can apply this to your own projects. You will hear about a database migration from MySQL to Cassandra in a high-traffic critical production system and a data migration that involved recreating the whole database in a complex legacy system.\n\nView the full SREcon18 Europe Program at: https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon18europe/program\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
