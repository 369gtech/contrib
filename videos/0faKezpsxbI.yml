In this talk, Pavlos will explain what MLOps is about and why it's important in order to scale ML at your organization. Additionally, Pavlos will provide best practices and tips on how you can build an MLOps platform without the need to hire 10 software engineers and data scientists.\n\nAbout the speaker\n-----------------------\nPavlos Mitsoulis is a Staff Data Scientist leading the Reinforcement Learning team at Expedia Group and the co-creator of Sagify, an open source MLOps CLI tool to easily train, tune and deploy ML models on Sagemaker by implementing just a train and a predict function.
