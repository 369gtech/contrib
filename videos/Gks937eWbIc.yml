description: "Hell Freezes Over: The New Reality of Open Cloud Services and the OSBAPI - Josh McKenty, Pivotal\n\nThere are many options when it comes to choosing a cloud platform. How do you know you picked the right one? Each has it's own advantages. What if you want to use more than one? As many of us know, Cloud Foundry provides this multi-cloud portability.\n\nBut what about services? There are so many available services and like Pokemon, you want to catch, err use, them all. How do we bring portability to cloud services across industries and across vendors?\n\nIn his presentation, Josh will talk about the impact of the Open Service Broker API project. The project provides a simple way to deliver services on cloud native platforms. Cloud Foundry, and Kubernetes are initial adopters. Contributors include individuals from Pivotal, IBM, Google, RedHat, and more.\n\nAbout Josh McKenty\nEntrepreneur and technologist Joshua McKenty works with Fortune 100 customers who seek to transition to a cloud native architecture, and with Pivotal’s Cloud Foundry team to bring new features and functionality to Cloud Foundry-based products, the industry-standard enterprise platform for the cloud era. A San Francisco Business Times 40-Under-40 Leader and NASA Ames Honor Award recipient, McKenty has been instrumental in defining and bringing cloud solutions to market. He co-founded OpenStack, the definitive open cloud solution for Infrastructure-as-a-Service, and Piston (acquired by Cisco), which provides OpenStack-based private cloud solutions for marquee enterprises across industries.

In his spare time, Joshua has crafted a handmade violin and banjo, fathered two children, and invented his own juggling trick, the McKenty Madness."
