title: 'Tanzu TV - Between Chair and Keyboard - The one with Jonathan Johnson'
language: English
recordingDate: 1618257402
description: 'Please join Nate Schutta and Jonathan Johnson, an independent software architect with a concentration on helping others unpack the riches in the cloud native and Kubernetes ecosystems. For 30 years Jonathan has been designing useful software to move businesses forward. His career began creating laboratory instrument software and throughout the years, his focus has been moving with industry advances benefitting from Mooreâ€™s Law. He was enticed by the advent of object-oriented design and applied it to financial software. As banking moved to the internet, enterprise applications took off and Java exploded onto the scene. Since then, he has inhabited that ecosystem. After a few years, he returned to laboratory software and leveraged Java-based state machines and enterprise services to manage the terabytes of data flowing out of DNA sequencing instruments. As a hands-on architect, he applied the advantages of microservices, containers, and Kubernetes with a laboratory management platform.'
