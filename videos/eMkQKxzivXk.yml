description: "This video was recorded at the virtual Lambda Days conference, which took place on 16-19th February 2021 - https://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays...\n\nMore great virtual tech conferences - https://codesync.global​ \n\n---\n\nSound on BEAM  Music in the Land of Distributed Lisp\nby Duncan McGreggor\n\nABSTRACT\nWhile not built for sound or digital signal processing, Erlang excels in the realm where music control systems have converged: network message-passing. In this talk, Duncan will provide some background on the functional nature of electronics used in music, with a special focus on analog synthesis a la Moog modular systems. Previous sound-generation work on the BEAM will be covered before diving into a new effort along similar lines being made in Lisp Flavoured Erlang (LFE). Practical issues with integrating multiple well-established improvisational tools and music recording systems with a functional programming language will be covered. In addition, LFE's strength as a platform for creating DSL's will be discussed in the dual context of integrating systems and creating generative music.\n---\n\nSPEAKER - Duncan McGreggor\nDuncan started hacking in the early 80s on copies of the BSD games, was a linguist in the 101st Airborne Division, studied physics and applied maths at university, traveled to India to practice meditation and dialectic with monks in exile, and eventually joined a startup just before the Internet crash in 1999/2000. Somehow, that did not deter his life-long passion for programming: he started hacking on small, distributed services in the early 2000s, eventually became a Fellow at the Python Software Foundation, joined Robert Virding as a contributor to LFE, and coded in another Lisp for the USGS (LANDSAT data) and then NASA. Duncan is currently a principal engineer at MediaMath, dedicated to building better engineering teams and software engineering practices while also teaching new generations of engineers a love for the art.\n\n\n---\n\nLambda Days\nWebsite: https://www.lambdadays.org​\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/LambdaDays​"
