description: "Client-side web development has long been the sole domain of JavaScript. WebAssembly is poised to change that by opening up the web to the full ecosystem of languages, frameworks, and tools. Blazor is an experimental project to bring .NET to the Web via WebAssembly. In this session you'll see how Blazor enables full stack web apps using C# with no code transpilation or plugins â€“ just open web standards.\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61qmX5eAPwI&t=1s"
