description: "How well do you know your users? Imagine a person who can't see, use a mouse, or someone who can't differentiate between colors. Is your site convenient for them? Will they consider coming back? Web development, just like business, is always about users. More specifically, it's about them wanting to come back. We will start by looking at the reasons for building inclusive interfaces backed by stats. You will learn to develop accessible websites with little effort, test them using tools such as screen readers, and automate accessibility testing to remain productive. You will understand useful patterns supported by real-life experience gathered while building inclusive components e.g. charts, notifications, and drag-&-drop elements.\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
