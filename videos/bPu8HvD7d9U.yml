description: "Google Tech Talk, 2/22/2016, Presented by Anand Babu and Craig Nevill-Manning\n\nABSTRACT: Since humans first settled in cities thousands of years ago, technology has repeatedly revolutionized the way we live. Just in the last 200 years, steam, electricity and the automobile have radically changed the daily lives of city residents.

Sidewalk Labs will discuss the opportunities and challenges that they are taking on as they start up right here in New York City.\n\nNote: Some slides are blurred due to confidential material.\n\nAbout the speakers:\n\nAnand Babu\n\nAnand is Chief Operating Officer for Sidewalk Labs.
