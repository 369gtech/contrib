language: English
recordingDate: 1411367439
description: "Maybe you've heard of Mesos--that thing that you can run Hadoop on. I think it powers Twitter? Isn't it an Apache project, or something?\n\nIn this talk, we'll learn all about Mesos--what it is, how you can leverage it to simplify your infrastructure and reduce AWS/cloud computing costs, and why you should develop your next application on top of it. This talk will give you the tools you need to understand whether Mesos is the right fit for your infrastructure, and several starting points for learning more about Mesos.\n\nDavid Greenberg\nTwo Sigma\n@dgrnbrg\n\nDavid Greenberg loves learning. He currently works at Two Sigma, where he leads several efforts to build reliable, distributed cluster computing environments. He also enjoys writing Clojure."
