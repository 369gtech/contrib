description: "Machine learning has traditionally been the solely performed on servers and high performance machines. But there is great value is having on-device machine learning for mobile devices. Doing ML inference on mobile devices has huge potential and is still in its early stages. However, it's already more powerful than most realize.\n\nIn this demo-oriented talk, Yufeng shows some examples of deep learning models used for local prediction on mobile devices. Learn how to use TensorFlow to implement a machine learning model that is tailored to a custom dataset, and start making delightful experiences today!\n\nEVENT:\n\ndotAI 2017\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nYufeng Guo\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nThe original video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3jKLNyKRhg"
