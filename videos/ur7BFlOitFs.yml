description: "Friday Hacks 174\nEver wondered what goes into the development of the Linux kernel? We discuss, among other things, the kernelâ€™s development process and some rationale behind it, how to get a patch into the kernel, some useful tools in figuring your way around the kernel source, and some ideas on how to actually work on the kernel codebase itself. As far as possible, no background knowledge about operating systems will be assumed.\n\nSpeaker: Tee Hao Wei\nHao Wei is a computer science undergraduate and an NUS Hackers coreteam member.\n\nEvent Page: meetup.com/NUSHackers\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\nRecorded by: NUS Hackers\nRecorded on: 12 April 2019\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/o09q/"
