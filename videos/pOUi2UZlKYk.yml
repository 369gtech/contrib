recordingDate: 1439395962
description: "Grace Huang, Founder & Creative Director (in martial arts)\n\nGrace isn’t someone you will want to mess around with, and you’ll only need to see her business card to know why - She is one half of the dynamic duo behind Trifecta Martial Arts, and is trained in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (with medals under that, no less), Chinese Wushu and Muay Thai.\n\nBesides fighting, gruelling workouts, and the occasional extreme meal plans to keep in tip-top condition, this tough nut is pretty much a slave to her Macbook(s), whipping up creative design work as a freelance web/graphic designer and art director. Her work includes various projects for big-name brands and corporations including Ogilvy & Mather (Singapore), Mercedes Benz, and the Ritz Carlton Hotel (Singapore)… to name a few.\n\nIn other words, she’s also a nerd in disguise. Looks are always deceiving, aren’t they?\n\nEvent Page: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/fuckup-nights-singapore-vol-iv-tickets-17964491277\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/WCgu/"
