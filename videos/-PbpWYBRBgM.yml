title: 'Charlie Gerard on Mind control in JavaScript - Experimenting with alternative interactions'
recordingDate: 1542861452
description: "Charlie Gerard - on future of emotive interfaces\nA typical interaction with a device or interface involves touching it. Either you're pressing buttons on a controller, swiping on a touchscreen or clicking on your laptop's trackpad. But what if you could control things without the use of your hands? What if you could use... your thoughts? \n\nFor the past couple of years, I have been tinkering with a brain sensor and developed an open-source JavaScript framework to allow me (or anyone else) to control interfaces or robots using facial expressions and mental commands. In this talk, I will be sharing what I learnt, showing how it works and talking about the future possibilities of alternative interactions."
