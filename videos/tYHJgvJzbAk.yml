He’s proud to have been a part of ThoughtWorks’ journey for fourteen years and of contributing to it’s ongoing mission of delivering technical excellence for its clients and in amplifying positive social change through technology. As a member of the ThoughtWorks Technical Advisory Board, the group that creates the Technology Radar, he contributes to industry adoption of open source and other tools, techniques, platforms, and languages.\n\nHe is an internationally recognised expert on software architecture and design and on its intersection with organisational design and lean product development.
