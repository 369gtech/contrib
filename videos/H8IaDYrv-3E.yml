description: "npm has more data than anyone about who JavaScript developers are and what we’re up to. Using our unparalleled access to registry usage stats and the results of our 2019 ecosystem survey of over 33,000 developers, I break down the current state of JavaScript and where trends look like they’re headed, from frameworks through security best practices, so you can make more informed technical choices.\n\nLaurie has been a web developer for 23 years and is passionate about making the web better and web development more accessible to everybody. He is co-founder and Chief Data Officer at npm, Inc., provider of package management and security services to the JavaScript developers of the world.\n\n\nJSConf.Asia - LASALLE College of the Arts, Singapore - 16 June 2019\n\nSource: https://2019.jsconf.asia/\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
