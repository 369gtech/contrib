description: "Highly Available Kubernetes Clusters - Best Practices - Meaghan Kjelland & Karan Goel, Google \n\nEveryone running a Kubernetes cluster in production wants reliability and high availability. Many clusters may implement a multi-master setup, but often this is not enough to consider a cluster highly available.   So how can you truly achieve a highly available, highly reliable, and multi-master kubernetes cluster? In this talk, we will cover exactly that. The audience will walk away with a solid understanding of what HA is, what failure domains should be considered based on their level of risk tolerance, and actionable knowledge that they can implement in their own organizations. This talk will include examples and lessons learned implementing HA in GKE and for the open source cluster-api, but we will focus on using this knowledge in a vendor and environment neutral way. \n\nTo Learn More: https://sched.co/GrWQ"
