description: "Talk recording from AmsterdamJS March 2019 Meetup https://www.meetup.com/AmsterdamJS/events/259124456/\n\nAs an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime, Node is designed to build scalable network applications. It does not employ multi-threading and yet achieves a desired level of concurrency using its event loop architecture with I/O delegated to libuv. Under the hood, Libuv manages workers to handle asynchronous tasks. During this talk, we will dive into the event loop phases with live code samples e.g. file I/O, data pipelines.\n\nDipro will share some challenges with designing production systems and their solutions.\n\nAbout Dipro\n\nDipro is a Senior Software engineer at DAZN, working on the payments and subscriptions services that enable the user journey of a DAZN customer and generate revenue for the company. I work on AWS, Terraform, Drone and NodeJS. I like promises in Node but never keep them in my personal life."
