description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nHunting For New Particles Leveraging Legacy Infrastructure with Kubernetes - Clemens Lange, CERN \n\nIn the search for unknown particles in the CERN Large Hadron Collider’s particle collisions, billions of events need to be analysed. Even though large parts of CERN’s computing infrastructure are deployed using Kubernetes, physics analysis jobs are still being run on classical high throughput computing batch systems. While developing a fully cloud native computing approach, one still needs to have access to the ten-thousands of cores available on the legacy batch system to have sufficient resources for the data processing.  In this presentation, Clemens will demonstrate how complex physics analysis workflows that are written and scheduled using Kubernetes can make use of classical batch systems. The audience will also learn what complexity a realistic physics analysis can reach, and the important role that software containers and Kubernetes play in the context of open science.\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zeji"
