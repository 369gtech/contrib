description: "Unit Testing and Monitoring Your Network Flows with Fwunit\n\nDustin J. Mitchell and Michal Purzynski, Mozilla\n\nConfiguration of network flows, particularly across multiple firewalls, cloud providers, and datacenters, is complex, prone to error, and difficult for people who are not network engineers to follow. In a DevOps environment, we want to enjoy the benefits of software development even for our infrastructure. SDN lets us *write* our network, but what about continuous integration testing? Viewing changes over time? Visibility and intelligibility to other team members? Fwunit is a tool to address those needs and more.\n\nDustin has been a system administrator and software developer at Mozilla for five years, working with the Release Engineering team. His responsibilities include configuration management, network access-control administration, web services development and deployment, and administration of the multi-layered continuous-integration build system. His spare-time activities include homebrewing and, of late, curling.\n\nView the full LISA15 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa15/conference-program"
