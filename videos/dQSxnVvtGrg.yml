Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nCloud native is the 6th generation of enterprise compute (mainframe, mini, x86 bare metal, virtualization, cloud IaaS) but weâ€™re still relatively early in its lifecycle. For all the hype and excitement, many large enterprises have only just begun to understand its potential, much less to move significant portions of their stack to it. At the same time, the technical components are maturing and coalescing around a core set of open source technologies that can be packaged in a variety of forms while retaining that openness and portability. In this session, we look out a few years and imagine how a typical enterprise is using cloud native, what value they get from it, and what we as a community need to do to ensure that happens."
