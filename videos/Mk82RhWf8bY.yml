description: "by Shelley Lambert\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/H.1302/deep_learning_openjdk.webm\n\n\nIn this talk, we identify some well-known software verification problems,\nusing real-world examples from open-source projects and see how we might\napply some deep learning principles to address them.  In the various points\nwhere we may test the Java runtime, we find candidates for deep learning.  What\nis required?  We need a problem to solve, a model that describes it, and a\nlarge amount of data to feed the neural network. \n\nRoom: H.1302 (Depage)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 14:20:00+01"
