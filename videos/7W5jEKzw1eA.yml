description: "Flink Forward Berlin, September 2018 #flinkforward\n\nFailures are inevitable. How can we recover a Flink job from outage? How do we reprocess data from outage period? What are the implications to downstream consumers? These are important questions that we need to answer when running Flink for critical data processing applications. We implemented two solutions for our stream processing platform: (1) use data warehouse, like Hive, as backfill source (2) rewind Flink job using external checkpoint. We will describe both solutions in details, and discuss the pros and cons of each approach. We will also take a look at some of the caveats to watch out for.\_\n\nhttps://data-artisans.com/"
