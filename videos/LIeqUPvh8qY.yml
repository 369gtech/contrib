title: 'Learn Once, Write Anywhere: Intro to React Native - Aaron Greenwald'
recordingDate: 1465131511
description: "Facebook introduced a new way to develop native mobile applications using JavaScript: React Native. Though this doesn't sound like a very revolutionary concept, the way Facebook chose to do it makes React Native stand out among its peers. In this talk, we’ll take a look at what RN is, how it differs from its competition, and why we might want to use it. Geared toward developers with limited or no experience building mobile applications, it takes a high level view of the framework and makes a compelling case for considering it as part of  your toolset. \n\nLink to presentation slides: https://speakerdeck.com/aarongreenwald/learn-once-write-anywhere-intro-to-react-native\n\nAbout Aaron: Before mobile development with React Native existed, Aaron architected and built web apps using AngularJS and other web development tech. Now he’s part of the team building Wix’s mobile presence, and is focused on delivering first-class experiences to users who need their business to be mobile. He enjoys talking about React Native and teaching others how to use it.\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/aaronjgreenwald\nGithub: https://github.com/aarongreenwald"
