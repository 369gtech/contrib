description: "http://www.Cppcon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2015\n—\nSound is an essential medium for human-computer interaction and vital for applications such as games and music production software. In the audio industry, C++ is the dominating programming language. This talk provides an insight into the patterns and tools that C++ developers in the audio industry rely on. There are interesting lessons to be learned from this domain that can be useful to every C++ developer.\n\nHandling audio in real time presents interesting technical challenges. Techniques also used in other C++ domains have to be combined: real-time multithreading, lock-free programming, efficient DSP, SIMD, and low-latency hardware communication. C++ is the language of choice to tie all these requirements together. Clever leveraging of advanced C++ techniques, template metaprogramming, and the new C++11/14 standard makes these tasks more exciting than ever.\n— \nTimur Doumler is Senior Software Developer at London-based technology company ROLI. He is working with Julian Storer to further develop JUCE, the leading cross-platform framework for creating audio applications that is used by hundreds of companies in the audio industry.\n\nAfter five years of writing high-performance code in Fortran, C, and C++ for numerical simulations of the cosmic structure formation, Timur became committed to audio and music production software. Before joining ROLI, he worked on various projects at market-leading company Native Instruments, such as KONTAKT, the industry standard sampling platform used by the majority of music producers and composers for film score, games, and contemporary popular music.\n\nTimur holds a PhD in astrophysics and is passionate about well-written code, modern C++ techniques, science-fiction, learning languages, and progressive rock music.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
