description: "Getting different IT systems to talk to each other doesn't need to be hard, but we often find ways to make it much more difficult than it needs to be. \n\nThis talk will discuss some of the common mistakes made when trying to move data between different systems, and ways to avoid them. The focus will be on the most common use case: real time communication in a single direction.\n\nThe talk will have examples using Python and RabbitMQ, although the principals we will discuss could apply to many technologies and communication paradigms.\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).
