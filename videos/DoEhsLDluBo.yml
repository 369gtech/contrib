Ask the Electronic Frontier Foundation about Copyright, Innovation, and the NSA\r\n\r\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is one of the leading online civil liberties groups. Join EFF attorneys as they deliver the the latest on the fight against warrantless wiretapping, promoting increased government transparency, and protecting your right to use the media you own.

In that role, he has represented programmers, technology innovators, and individuals in a variety of copyright and trademark litigation, including MGM v. Grokster, decided by the Supreme Court in 2005.\r\n \r\nMarcia Hofmann is an EFF staff attorney working on government transparency, civil liberties, and intellectual property issues.
