description: "Google Tech Talks\nOctober 5, 2006\n\nWilliam J. Dally\n\nBill Dally is the Willard R. and Inez Kerr Bell Professor of Engineering and the Chairman of the Department of Computer Science at Stanford University. Bill and his group have developed system architecture, network architecture, signaling, routing, and synchronization technology that can be found in most large parallel computers today.\n\nABSTRACT\nHigh-radix interconnection networks offer significantly better cost/performance and lower latency than conventional (low-radix) topologies. Increasing radix is motivated by the exponential increase in router pin bandwidth over time. Increasing the radix or degree of a router node is a more efficient..."
