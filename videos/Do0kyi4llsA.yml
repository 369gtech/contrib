Have you ever deleted all the data in production? Or maybe you’ve just run out of disk space and your software failed miserably! How about crashing your server with a bug you introduced in the latest release? We can learn from each other’s mistakes. Come to this BOF to share your most horrific development story and what you did to fix it."
