title: 'YOW! Data 2018 - Linda McIver - Kids can change the world with data'
recordingDate: 1528419399
description: "From researchers perpetrating unspeakable acts with their datasets, to students trying to communicate experimental results with pie charts that don’t sum to 100, we have all seen data horror stories. But in my classes kids have worked with their communities to create real change using data and computation. We can band together to give all kids the opportunity to change the world. This is the story of kids. Of data. Of Computation. And of change. It’s the story of the Australian Data Science Education Institute.\n\nDr Linda McIver started out as an Academic with a PhD in Computer Science Education. When it became apparent that High School teaching was a lot more fun, Linda began a highly successful career at John Monash Science School, where she built innovative courses in Computational and Data Science for year 10 and year 11 students.\n\nNominated one of the inaugural Superstars of STEM in 2017, Linda is passionate about creating authentic project experiences to motivate all students to become technologically and data literate.\n\nWhile Linda loves the classroom, it was rapidly becoming clear that teachers in the Australian School system were keen to embrace Data Science, but that there was a serious lack of resources to support that. That’s why Linda created ADSEI – to support Data Science in education.\n\n\n For more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
