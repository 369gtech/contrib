description: "To understand recursion you must first understand recursion. This video will help you do just that! Learn how recursion works with flowcharts and code. The code is in Python but the concepts apply to any programming language.\n\nRecursive functions have a base case and recursive case. Watch out for infinite loops!\n\nThis video is part of a course called 'Algorithms in Motion' from Manning Publications.
