description: "The Differentiable Neural Computer is an awesome model that DeepMind recently released. It's a memory augmented network that can perform meta-learning (learning to learn). We'll go over it's architecture details and implement it ourselves in Tensorflow. \n\nCode for this video: https://github.com/llSourcell/differentiable_neural_computer\n\nPlease Subscribe! And like.
