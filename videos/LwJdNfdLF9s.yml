title: 'Floyd Warshall Algorithm All Pair Shortest Path Graph Algorithm'

recordingDate: 1449992362
description: "This algorithm finds shortest path between every pair of vertices.\nhttps://www.facebook.com/tusharroy25\nhttps://github.com/mission-peace/interview/blob/master/src/com/interview/graph/FloydWarshallAllPairShortestPath.java\nhttps://github.com/mission-peace/interview/wiki\n\nn computer science, the Floyd–Warshall algorithm is an algorithm for finding shortest paths in a weighted graph with positive or negative edge weights (but with no negative cycles).[1][2] A single execution of the algorithm will find the lengths (summed weights) of the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices, though it does not return details of the paths themselves. Versions of the algorithm can also be used for finding the transitive closure of a relation R, or (in connection with the Schulze voting system) widest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph."
