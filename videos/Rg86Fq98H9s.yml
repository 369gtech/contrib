title: 'Webinar: Using KubeVirt in telcos'
language: English
recordingDate: 1600878364
description: "Kubernetes has become the defacto standard for cloud-native architecture. Kubernetes has been primarily built with a strong focus around containers whereas the telco world is still far away from complete migration from VNF (Virtual Network Functions) to CNF (Container-based cloud-native functions). To make Kubernetes useful for telcos, we need the hosting capability of virtual machines inside the PODS. This has been made possible bt the CNCF sandbox project KubeVirt (https://kubevirt.io/).\n\nIn this Webinar, we will cover the relevance of KubeVirt for telcos. There will also be a demonstration of using KubeVirt in hosting a windows VM and discuss current limitations and challenges from the telco adoption perspective.\n\nPresenter:\n\nAbhinivesh Jain, Distinguished Member of Technical Staff @Wipro"
