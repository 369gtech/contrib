description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io\_The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nIntro: K8s IoT Edge Working Group – Adopting a Cloud Control Plane to Edge - Steven Wong, VMware & Dejan Bosanac, Red Hat \n\nEdge refers to geographic distribution of compute, data ingest, and network. A lot of use cases fit under this “umbrella”. Kubernetes was born as a solution for large scale application hosting in a cloud. Edge deployments have much in common with public cloud - large scale, desire for automated remote management - but at the same time there are key differences. This session will be an introduction to challenges of applying Kubernetes for edge and IoT applications. We will survey some solutions for addressing these challenges, and cover how you can interact with the open source community to learn about and help build better solutions for edge. \n\nhttps://sched.co/cpAG"
