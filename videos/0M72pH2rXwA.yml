description: "You might have heard about Project Jigsaw in Java 9 but did you see it in action? This talk will walk you through the features and pitfalls while modularizing an example application.\n\nIt will show how to:\n\n- define modules and a module graph;\n- migrate an application while handling unmodularized dependencies;\n- analyze an application and its dependencies for compatibility problems.\n\nWith the different pieces of the puzzle coming together you will be able to vet or even spike _your_ appâ€™s migration."
