description: "In this talk, we will have some fun looking at the Scalaz library when it first started and the objectives that necessitated it. Some of the more ubiquitous abstractions of Scalaz will be discussed in detail, along with examples of practical application.\n\nScalaz has had a contentious history, with staunch absence of compromise for less principled approaches to programming. We will look at the reasons for this approach and the practical outcomes that result. The talk also address some of the most common concerns surrounding the Scalaz library."
