description: "We can use reinforcement learning to build an automated trading bot in a few lines of Python code! In this video, i'll demonstrate how a popular reinforcement learning technique called \"Q learning\" allows an agent to approximate prices for stocks in a portfolio. The literature of reinforcement learning is incredibly rich. There are so many concepts, like TD-Learning and Actor-Critic for example, that have real-world potential. I hope this video gives you insight into how this incredibly powerful yet simple algorithm works, enjoy! \n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/Q-Learning-for-Trading\n\nPlease Subscribe!
