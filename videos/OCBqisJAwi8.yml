description: 'Java SE 8 brings a bounty of improvements - Lambda Expressions, the new Date Time API, Completable Futures, streams and the fork/join common pool. In this code intensive session we will explore how these Java SE 8 features can be utilized inside Java EE 7 applications with APIs such as Servlet, JAX-RS, WebSocket, CDI, EJB 3, JPA, JMS and Java EE Concurrency Utilities. We will also briefly explore how Java SE 8 features could be effectively incorporated into Java EE 8 and beyond.'
