description: "The FaaS revolution is taking the world by storm. It just so happens that JavaScript has become the lingua franca of the FaaS revolution. Customers love the no-ops and ergonomics of this new paradigm. They enable a revolution in developer velocity, allowing engineers to deploy code to production much faster than before. \n\nAt Netflix, these features are a perfect fit for the Netflix API Platform, which provides engineers the ability to write and deploy tier-1 services using JS without having to manage infrastructure or operations. \n\nHowever, there are trade-offs to consider. Most FaaS offerings today are great for latency insensitive tasks, but not for fully fledged services that need to be isolated, low latency, reliable, and elastically scalable. \n\nLearn about the architecture and internals of Netflixâ€™s JS FaaS platform, which lets engineers deploy JS functions as isolated, reliable, and low latency production services.\n\nEVENT:\n\nNodeConf EU 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nYunong Xiao\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nNearForm provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish NodeConf EU videos."
