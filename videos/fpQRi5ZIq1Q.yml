description: "Talk recording from Amsterdam JSNation 2019 Conference: https://jsnation.com\n\n# Open Source: Charity or Business?\n\nWe use the term open source to mean a lot of things: it's difficult to discuss the struggles of simply being a maintainer whether you are a volunteer or working on it at a company. We lack clarity in what sustainability looks like because there are so many different goals: diversity in participation and work, community building, building a business. I'll be going through some of my experiences in going from onlooker to contributor to full time maintainer and how we may want to broaden what maintenance looks like and where we can look to for guidance."
