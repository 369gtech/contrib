description: "…and other stories from an ops-less world.\n\nThree years ago 99designs transitioned away from having an ops team. Not “we now have a devops team”, not “we’ve switched to calling our sysadmins SREs”, but instead all operations work is done by regular web developers. The business has continued to grow, and contrary to expectations, the site is more reliable than ever.\n\nThe talk will be about how we made it work, why it works for us, and how it could (in whole or part) work for you.\n\nJohn Barton is Head of Engineering for 99designs, the world’s largest graphic design marketplace. Formerly: cofounder of a failed startup and engineering manager at Envato from before it was called Envato.\n\nFor more on YOW! conferences, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
