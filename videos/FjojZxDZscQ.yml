recordingDate: 1526221370
description: "Speakers: Brian Okken, Paul Everitt\n\nKnow you should be doing testing but haven’t gotten over the hurdle to learn it? pytest is Python’s modern, friendly, and powerful testing framework. When paired with an IDE, testing gets a visual interface, making it much easier to get started.\n\nIn this talk we cover “visual testing”: starting, learning, using, and mastering test-driven development (TDD) with the help of a nice UI. We’ll show PyCharm Community Edition, a free and open-source Python IDE, as a productive TDD environment for pytest. Specifically, we’ll show a workflow using pytest and PyCharm that helps make tests speed up development, or at the very least help to make testing seem less \"in the way\" of other development activities\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2018 and https://github.com/PyCon/2018-slides"
