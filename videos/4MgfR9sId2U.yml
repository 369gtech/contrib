They allow you to package, deploy and manage Kubernetes applications. But there is more to it. Operators also let you encode your operational knowledge and apply it from within the cluster. This talk wants to introduce Operators, explain the why, give working examples and go into some best practices for development. We will also look at tasks beyond packaging and deployment that can be performed by an Operator."
