description: "Tempo, Maneuverability, and Initiative\n\nMichael Nygard, VP, Customer Solutions, Cognitect Inc.\n\nDevOps is part of a larger shift in organizational structure, system architecture, infrastructure, and process design. All these things must change together to achieve high tempo. There are many ways a company can get derailed and slip back into slow-mode behavior. This talk looks at several transformation efforts - some successful, some failed - through a lens of tempo, maneuver warfare, and initiative.\n\nDOES16 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
