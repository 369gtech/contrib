description: "The web platform never stops. Every few months, the W3C and browser vendors unload great big bundles of shiny new toys for web developers everywhere.\n\nNew JavaScript API standards emerging right now make the web suitable for truly slick applications, having access to many of the same OS and hardware features as native apps, offline or online.\n\nThis talk will be an almost-continuous series of demos of recent and upcoming JavaScript APIs and features. You'll learn of new possibilities that will hopefully be relevant to the apps you build."
