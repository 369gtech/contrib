description: "Australian digital artist Justin Maller has been creating for over twenty years. This presentation dives in to the massive body of work he produced over two decades, discussing the projects, people and hardships that comprise it and the circular narratives that emerged.\n\nCombining limited intellect with vast amounts of free time, Justin has been able to extract a few hard won key truths from an unusual career. He will be illustrating and sharing these in the hopes others can learn from them, and gain some perspective on the seasonal nature of creativity and the importance of forging genuine relationships.\n\nJustin Maller\ndeviantart.com\nhttps://twitter.com/justinmaller\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttps://fitc.ca/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=video-description\n\nSave 10% off any FITC event with discount code 'youtube'.\nSee our upcoming events at https://fitc.ca/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=video-description"
