Naive Bayes Classifier overview\n2. Example of Naive Bayes Classifier\n3. Determining Prior Probability\n\nRelated blogs:\nhttp://www.edureka.co/blog/application-of-clustering-in-data-science-using-real-life-examples/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=naive-bayes-classifier\nhttp://www.edureka.co/blog/who-can-take-up-a-data-science-tutorial/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=naive-bayes-classifier\n\nEdureka is a New Age e-learning platform that provides Instructor-Led Live, Online classes for learners who would prefer a hassle free and self paced learning environment, accessible from any part of the world.\n\nThe topics related to ‘Naive Bayes Classifier’ have been covered in our course ‘Data science’.\nFor more information, please write back to us at sales@edureka.co"
