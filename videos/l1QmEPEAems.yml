description: "( Hadoop Training: https://www.edureka.co/hadoop )\nCheck our Hadoop Installation blog here: https://goo.gl/i54RIL\nThis Edureka Hadoop Installation Tutorial will help you to learn how to install Hadoop (Single Node Hadoop Installation) on a CentOS operating system. The same steps can be used for Hadoop Installation on Ubuntu, Hadoop Installation on Mac and Hadoop Installation on Windows (using a linux VM). Below are the softwares that are required for this setup:\n1) CentOS Operating System: In this Hadoop Tutorial we have used a CentOS edureka virtual machine to install Hadoop. You can also use Linux(CentOS, Ubuntu, etc) or Mac as primary operating system for this installation. If you have windows then you can use a Linux(CentOS, Ubuntu, MAC etc) virtual machine (VM). The steps to install Hadoop remains the same. \n2) Java: In this Hadoop Tutorial we have used JDK (Java Devlopment Kit) version 1.7. \n3) Hadoop Binary file: In this Hadoop Tutorial we have used one of the latest and stable version of Hadoop i.e. Hadoop-2.7.2. The same steps can be applied to install any of the Hadoop 2.x versions.\n\nSubscribe to our channel to get video updates.

A Worldwide Problem?\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, \"Big data is collection of data sets so large and complex that it becomes difficult to process using on-hand database management tools or traditional data processing applications.\" In simpler terms, Big Data is a term given to large volumes of data that organizations store and process. However, it is becoming very difficult for companies to store, retrieve and process the ever-increasing data. If any company gets hold on managing its data well, nothing can stop it from becoming the next BIG success!\n\nThe problem lies in the use of traditional systems to store enormous data. Though these systems were a success a few years ago, with increasing amount and complexity of data, these are soon becoming obsolete. The good news is - Hadoop, which is not less than a panacea for all those companies working with BIG DATA in a variety of applications and has become an integral part for storing, handling, evaluating and retrieving hundreds of terabytes, and even petabytes of data.\n\nPlease write back to us at sales@edureka.co or call us at +91 88808 62004 for more information. \n\nCustomer Review:\n\nMichael Harkins, System Architect, Hortonworks says: “The courses are top rate. The best part is live instruction, with playback. But my favorite feature is viewing a previous class. Also, they are always there to answer questions, and prompt when you open an issue if you are having any trouble. Added bonus ~ you get lifetime access to the course you took!!! Edureka lets you go back later, when your boss says \"I want this ASAP!\" ~ This is the killer education app... I've take two courses, and I'm taking two more.”"
