description: "Everyone wants results but rarely do people know what exactly to expect. Even if they do know, the “results” don’t show up as quickly as they do in unit tests.\nThere is a way to develop, experiment and deliver useful stuff quickly and at an even pace — it’s a methodology called DevOps.\n– You can reduce the scope of your tasks to a few hours and concentrate on things that work.\n– You can collect feedback to know where you are going.\n– You can keep learning and improving.\nOnly then will you be able to tread uncharted waters safely.\nFor years, I have been looking for a way to deliver results, stay motivated and, perhaps, even save the world. No cape required.\nThe only thing left to do is to share my DevOps vision with you.\n\nAbout me:\nMažvydas works in the gaming industry, where engagement is key. Using his 15 years of experience in e-commerce and the gaming habit he’s always had, he’s now working to push the boundaries of engagement in the gaming space.\n\nLinkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/mazvydas-skuodas/"
