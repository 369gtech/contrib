Converted to computer science 15 years ago after a doctorate in neurobiology, he actively contributes to Java communities by having been co-responsible for the Java section of the developpez.com site but also by participating in conferences and having founded the JUG Towers in 2008.\n\nSÃ©bastien Laporte \nFrom Apside TOP\nSwiss knife engineer interested in development, sys admin and networks but also IoT and home automation"
