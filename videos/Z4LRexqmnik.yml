description: 'We all have an innate sense of what''s possible. Not only is this how magicians fool you, but it might also be what''s holding you back. In this session Michael Carducci shares how he applied lessons learned in his career as a professional magician to his “day-job” as a software engineer. Magicians have a simple process for creating new material; think of the most impossible thing you can imagine, the engineer a way to make it possible. Michael has been engineering solutions to “impossible” problems for nearly 20 years and this has given him a unique perspective on dealing with challenges in all aspects of his life. This talk combines illusion, anecdotes and real-world examples to help identify and overcome your mental obstacles.'
