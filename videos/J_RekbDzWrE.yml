language: English
recordingDate: 1552546819
description: "Presented by Johan Abildskov, Trainer & Consultant, Praqma\n\n\"Perhaps even more controversial than rebase vs. merge is Mono vs Many-repos. During my consultancy career I've helped companies go in either directions, with good reasons for both transitions. This talk will remove the gut-feeling part of deciding your repository structure, and instead dive into the available tools and considerations for deciding what is the right repository structure for your organisation based on science and technology.\"\n\nAbout GitMerge\nGit Merge is the pre-eminent Git-focused conference: a full-day offering technical content and user case studies, plus a day of workshops for Git users of all levels. Git Merge is dedicated to amplifying new voices in the Git community and to showcasing the most thought-provoking projects from contributors, maintainers and community managers around the world.
