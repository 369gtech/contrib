description: "Seetha Annamraju, Android Engineer Beginner Design / UI/UX, Velos Mobile\n\nBEYOND THE CODE: LESSONS ON BUILDING YOUR ANDROID \nMINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT\nBeginner / Design / UI/UX / Talk\n\nWe all have great ideas but as developers we have a tendency to spend more time on building apps than on iterating by sitting down with users. Building an Android app before using rapid prototyping methods to really figure out your MVP can be a lot of wasted time in the long run. You might end up building a beautiful app but you still may not be able to satisfy your users. Worse you could ruin your startup’s brand and make users disinterested in your future products. Rapid prototyping refining your idea and iterating with ample user feedback will allow you to build a great app incrementally and keep your users engaged. I launched my own startup a few years ago and through lessons learned built out a method to keep prototyping and development of app in balance. With my team I fine-tuned the art of mapping a user’s mindset and figuring out how to build prototypes to get user feedback quickly. I then took these lessons and helped other local startups to build prototypes quickly and launch their MVPs. In this talk you’ll learn about the steps involved in taking your idea to MVP stage while building Android apps. We will cover specific tools methods and processes for figuring out your idea’s market fit engaging users and building out your MVP."
