description: "Upcoming JS Conference:\r\nJS Fest 2020 - 3-4th of April, Kiev, Ukraine\r\nDetails and tickets: http://bit.ly/2EoHvQo\n\nThe talk from JS Fest conference in Kyiv, Ukraine.\nPresentation: https://www.slideshare.net/JSFestUA/js-fest-2018-martin-chaov-sse-vs-websockets-vs-long-polling\nFb: https://www.facebook.com/JSFestua/\nWebsite: http://jsfest.com.ua/\n\nIf you have a huge amount of data to deliver quickly you might have tried using web sockets to do so. However, sockets are hard to maintain and scale, not to mention multiplex. In this presentation I do comparison of the three methods of delivering data to the front-end. Server-Sent Events gives you the ability to deliver your content with less overhead on the infrastructural side. In this talk I will cover SSE, Long-Polling, and Web-Sockets with their pros and cons, including technical demo. We will touch a bit on connectionless push and available optimizations for the mobile network."
