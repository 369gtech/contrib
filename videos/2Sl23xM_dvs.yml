description: "Recorded at SpringOne 2GX 2012 in Washington, DC\nSpeaker: Lee Faus\nIn this episode we look at an old worn out application that has migrated from 3 different teams and 15 team lead changes. The poor application is now showing its years and doesn't perform like it did when it was first architected. Now through the help of a new platform, this application has an opportunity to shine again. Taking a look at past projects that have gone through similar transformations we will look at patterns and processes that can be leveraged to redesign traditional JEE applications into lightweight applications using Spring, CXF, SpringMVC, and SOA. Finally, we will walk through code examples to show how quickly applications can be developed using this new stack."
