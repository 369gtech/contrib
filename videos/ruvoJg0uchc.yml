description: "Islands In The Stream. Not just a Country classic, they’re also a fact of life for data streaming apps — sending data in different directions depending on your processing logic. Implementing these forks/splits/channels is easy in Spring Cloud Data Flow for Kubernetes once you know how. Ben Wilcock (@benbravo73) takes you through an example step by step, starting with the code and finishing with the configuration and deployment. All in under 7 minutes!\n\nAll the code to accompany this series can be found on GitHub: https://bit.ly/scdf-code.\nFull HD (1920 x 1080p) - Fullscreen mode is recommended."
