title: 'Sam Newman - Hiding The Lead: Coupling, Cohesion, and Microservices-Style'
language: English
recordingDate: 1619708882
description: '"The terms coupling and cohesion come from the world of structured programming, but they are also thrown about in the context of microservices. In this session, I look at the applicability of these terms to microservice architecture and also do a deep dive into the different types of coupling to explore how ideas from the 1970s still have a lot of relevance to the types of systems we build today."'
