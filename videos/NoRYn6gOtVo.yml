language: English
recordingDate: 1495229132
description: "Last year at I/O we launched Lighthouse, an open-source, automated tool for auditing and improving the quality of your web apps. One year later, we'll walk you through what's new in Lighthouse and how it's evolved into a companion for modern web development. We'll cover using Lighthouse in different environments (Node CLI, Chrome DevTools, WebPageTest, headless Chrome) and ways you can extend Lighthouse by authoring custom audits to run against your own site.\n\nWatch more Chrome and Web talks at I/O '17 here: https://goo.gl/Q1bFGY\nSee all the talks from Google I/O '17 here: https://goo.gl/D0D4VE\n\nSubscribe to the Chrome channel: http://goo.gl/LLLNvf\n\n#io17 #GoogleIO #GoogleIO2017"
