description: 'This talk will detail our experience using Clojure for our total solution in bioInformatics field. Genomic data is being stored rapidly because of the radical growth of DNA sequencer, and its size reaches several hundred GB per specimen. As part of this talk, I will discuss why we decided to use Clojure for analyzing such huge genomic data, while most of the bioinformatics tools are developed in C or Java for high performance. I will also touch on how Clojure is used for wide range of our solution of which 99% is written in Clojure(Script) from analysis modules on the back-end to the web front-end. I will just focus Clojure topics, so that attendees do not need to have expertise in bioinformatics.'
