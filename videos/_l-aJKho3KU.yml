title: 'You Have Too Much Time - Jeff Blankenburg'
recordingDate: 1472583584
description: 'In today’s social exchanges, “not having enough time” is a traditional excuse nearly everyone uses. I contend that, in fact, you have too much time, and it’s keeping you from changing the world. In the same way that too many choices forces indecision, having too much time brings its own share of challenges. This talk will address ways you can identify what your real priorities are (vs. what you tell yourself), show you how much of your days are truly wasted, and help you to stop feeling so overwhelmed.'
