description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Berlin 2018. #gotocon #gotober\nhttp://gotober.com\n\nOleg Šelajev - Developer Advocate at Oracle\n\nABSTRACT\nGraalVM project enhances the Java ecosystem with an integrated, polyglot, high-performance execution environment for dynamic, static, and native languages. GraalVM supports Java, Scala, Kotlin, Groovy, and other JVM-based languages. At the same time, it can run the dynamic scripting languages JavaScript including node.js, Ruby, R, and Python.\nIn this session you'll see demos and learn what you can do with GraalVM, from using it as the JVM JIT compiler, enhancing the JIT, running native and polyglot programs, compiling them ahead of time for faster startup and lower runtime overhead, debugging your polyglot code using exact same tools for any language, to profiling performance and memory [...]\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotober.com/2018/sessions/650\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotober\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttp://gotocon.com\n#GraalVM #Java #polyglot #JVMJIT"
