recordingDate: 1510794000
description: "How can you use robots to help you test?\n\nMeet Tappy McTapFace, Tappy is a robot that was built during a 2 day hackathon to help demonstrate how robots could be used to automate testing on mobile apps. It's made out of 3D printable parts, based on Taptser 2.0 open source designs and can be programmed in javascript.\nYou could also use a robotics challenge to engage your team around testing ideas. Sam will give her insights from running multiple testing challenges that engaged over 100 software engineers. From a lunch time robotics challenge to a company wide bug bash. Sam has run many events that help raise a companies testing culture.\n\nSam Connelly could be described as a motorbike riding, robotics obsessed, girl geek. She is a Test Engineer at EPAM Systems; she prefers 'quality activist', or even 'product risk identifier' as her title.\n\nMobile Explorative testing is her speciality and she is also the Leader of the Sydney Testers meetup group. Sam credits a technical background and a curious mind as being her major drivers in her pursuits.\n\nShe has previously hosted her own community radio show and started a Robogals chapter in Tasmania.\n\nFor more information on YOW!
