description: "Brent provides a live demonstration reversing engineering 17 or more unknown passenger vehicle CAN networks in under 10 minutes using new automated techniques. These unsupervised techniques are over 90% accurate and consistent when tested using production CAN networks and different driving conditions. He then introduces the Python and R code used for the demo and posted to his public GitHub repository at https://github.com/brent-stone/CAN_Reverse_Engineering The Dissertation explaining how the code works is also posted.\n\nEVENT:\n\nDef Con 27\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nBrent Stone\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nATTRIBUTION CREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkgxFplsTnM"
