description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nCustomized Cloud Native Logging: Fluent Bit in Open Service Mesh - Sanya Kochhar, Microsoft\n\nFluent Bit is a powerful tool for filtering and forwarding logs, and this talk will explore how it can be easily integrated into CNCF projects in containerized environments, be customized for users’ logging needs and be the right solution for your project. It is used by Open Service Mesh (OSM), ⁠an open-source cloud native service mesh, to help users process and send logs to various destinations. So why did OSM choose this particular CNCF log forwarding solution? How can those learnings help projects in the community inform their choice? In this talk, we will go into a practical example to demonstrate how to support multiple user scenarios with a few quick toggles; more specifically, filtering on log level, custom annotating logs and running traffic behind outbound proxy servers. This will showcase how OSM leverages Fluent Bit’s functionality and plugins for its log forwarding needs."
