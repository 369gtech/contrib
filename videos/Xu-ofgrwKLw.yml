The learning curve is steep and there are major pitfalls to make a (d)app scaleable, let alone user friendly. In short, end users should not be rocket scientists to use blockchain based applications.\n\nThis is why we came up with Arkane Network. Arkane gives app developers the power to develop blockchain applications without needing the in-depth blockchain knowledge. This allows them to focus on the application, their users and optimising the str experience. Our APIs can be used by developers and businesses to make blockchain accessible to all.\n\nWe will explore how we can use these API's to start building an application.\n\nDavy Van Roy \nFrom FundRequest\nWorking for more than 8 years as a java consultant, now working on blockchain technologies at FundRequest."
