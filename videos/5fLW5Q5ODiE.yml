description: "This tutorial shows you how to use Chrome DevTools to find ways to make your pages load faster. \n\nUsing Tony the Cat’s site, Kayce shows you how to audit a page with the Audits panel, use the Audits panel report to find ways to improve your page speed, experiment by adding one change at a time, and then measure each change to make sure that each is actually improving your speed. You can use this workflow to improve the speed of any page.\n\nThis tutorial covers some of the most common causes of slow site speed, including lack of text compression, large images, render-blocking resources, and too much JavaScript.\n\nOptimizing web speed, tutorial → http://bit.ly/2LemRYa\nExperiment with Tony’s site → https://glitch.com/edit/#!/tony\nPerformance Analysis Reference → http://bit.ly/2o8N1OQ\n\nWatch the last episode on debugging JavaScript → http://bit.ly/2PyxXGL\n\nSubscribe to the Chrome Developers channel → http://bit.ly/ChromeDevs1"
