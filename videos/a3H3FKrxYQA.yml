title: '#HITBLockdown D2 - Fuzzing File System Implementations To Uncover Security Bugs - Christopher Krah'
language: English
recordingDate: 1591143134
description: "Vulnerability research and especially “fuzz-testing” has become an ever-growing field recently. Finding (exploitable) vulnerabilities and developing effective countermeasures are an essential result from analyzing the inner workings and general system internals of complex systems. File systems are no exception to this and are an often overlooked component on both the attacker and defender side. This session presents our research on evaluating the robustness of multiple well established and newer file systems on BSD based systems. We will develop general guidelines about how to approach this area of research efficiently by narrowing down possible attack surfaces. Afterwards, we will dig deeper into important aspects of how to automate our ideas to efficiently fuzz kernel file system implementations.\n\n=== \n\nI’m a security researcher for the Fraunhofer FKIE, Germany with a focus on vulnerability research, fuzzing as well embedded security. In general, I’m interested in the complete exploitation process chain."
