description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nHow We Built a Cloud On K3s: The Learnings Of Growing Up Fast - Alex Jones & Anaïs Urlichs, Civo\n\nK3s has radically altered the way we think about interacting with Kubernetes by reducing operational knowledge to an API. This promotes a highly compelling experience through its simplicity and speed. At Civo, we have spent the past two years building an ethical cloud computing company around this technology in collaboration with the open-source community. But the journey has been hard... Running hundreds of micro-clusters has had a steep learning curve. Observability, production support and reliability have been dramatically scaled and tested as services have become popular. We have found nuances in K3s, changes within the hardware requirements and had to rebuild server racks. This talk will illustrate our journey of making clusters resilient within a multi-tenant environment and how company culture had to scale with the tech and community to support it."
