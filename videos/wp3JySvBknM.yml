description: "Postmortem Action Items: Plan the Work and Work the Plan\n\nSue Lueder and Betsy Beyer, Google\n\nIn the 2016 O'Reilly book Site Reliability Engineering, Google described our culture of blameless postmortems, and recommended that organizations institute a similar culture of postmortems after production incidents. This talk shares some best practices and challenges in designing an appropriate action item plan and subsequently executing that plan in a complex environment of competing priorities, resource limitations, and operational realities. We discuss best practices for developing high-quality action items (AIs) for a postmortem, plus methods of ensuring these AIs actually get implemented so that we dont suffer the exact same outage or even worse again. It's worth noting that Google teams are by no means perfect at formulating and executing postmortem action items. We still have a lot to learn in this difficult area, and are sharing our thoughts and strategies to give a starting point for discussion throughout the industry.\n\nView the full SREcon17 Americas Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon17americas/program"
