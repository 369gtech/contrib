recordingDate: 1239916024
description: 'If you use Photoshop, then you probably browse your images with Adobes Bridge, which shows you thumbnails of your files. Good news: The Bridge lets you preview images without going to the trouble of opening them. Bad news: Those previews result in large cache files that eat up your hard drive. Worse yet, they permit others to track what you''ve been looking at. Even if you''ve long since destroyed the original file, the thumbnail persists! Learn how to protect yourselfâ€”and maybe even save your job.'
