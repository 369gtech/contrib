title: 'Much Robots  Very Java  So IoT by Marcus Hirt, Miro Wengner'
language: English
recordingDate: 1510048484
description: "Robo4J is an upcoming open source framework for quickly building robots using popular, often inexpensive, hardware and the Java SE platform. A good example is Coff-E, an autonomous, partly 3D printed, robot using a Raspberry Pi for brains and commonly available off-the-shelf components for actuators and sensors.\n\nThis talk will show how to painlessly build an autonomous robotic vehicle using the nascent Robo4J framework. After the talk, you should have a good sense of how to quickly configure and run a hardware system of your own.\n\nThe following will be discussed: * An overview of the Robo4J framework. * An overview of the Robo4J tools. * Useful source code examples.\n\n# Marcus Hirt\nMarcus is one of the founders of Appeal Virtual Machines, the company that created the JRockit JVM. He is currently working in the Java Product Group at Oracle. In his spare time he used to enjoy coding on his many pet projects, composing music, and scuba diving. Now he has baby twins. Marcus has contributed articles, whitepapers, tutorials, and webinars to the Java community, and has been an appreciated speaker at various conferences. He is also one of the two authors behind a book about JVM technology (https://tinyurl.com/jrockitbook). He holds an M.Sc. in Comp. Sci. & Engineering from the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm.\n\n# Miro Wengner \nMiro Wengner is a enthusiast with focus on distributed systems design. He is one of the founders of the Robo4J project. Robo4J is a pure Java framework that helps Developers to be fully focused on IoT project logic instead of hardware difficulties. Miro has started his Java career at SUN Microsystems in 2002 as a Software Engineer and over the years he has been working on the development of big distributed systems running on JVM. Miro has been actively participating on various European conferences or JUGs as speaker or organiser. He is also involved in the JCP Program, doing technical book reviews for Packt Publishing. Miro loves cycling and snowboarding and is extremely thankful to his wife for her big understanding with his hobbies."
