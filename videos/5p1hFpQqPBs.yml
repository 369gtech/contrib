description: "Slides and more info: http://www.erlang-factory.com/euc2016/kostis-sagonas\n\nThe Erlang toolchain already contains a variety of frameworks and tools for testing programs. Some of them (e.g. EUnit) are primarily manual, in the sense that the programmer has to write unit tests and provide expected test results, while some others (e.g. EQC, Triq and PropEr) are only semi-automatic: they require the programmer to specify properties -and often appropriate generators- for these properties.\n\nThe talk introduces CutEr, a fully automatic testing tool that aims to achieve full path coverage, bringing Concolic Unit Testing to Erlang programs. Compared to existing testing tools, this tool is... well, just CutEr;)\n\nTalk objectives:\n\nIntroduce the idea of concolic unit testing of Erlang programs and the CutEr tool, show how it differs from all other existing testing tools, and how it can be used to identify errors in programs in a fully automatic way. \n\nTarget audience:\n\nAny Erlang programmer."
