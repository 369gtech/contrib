description: "PyData Warsaw 2018\n\nImagine two images of the same car model, same color and with small scratches on bumpers. How would you make a machine look at the scratches and decide if they are the same? This is a story about the implementation of a new structure of neural network trained on “triplets” of images which recognizes fine grained images similarity based on Deep Ranking algorithm.\n===\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
