Firstly, they must be motivated. Secondly, they must be persuaded to make decisions. Understanding the emotions that support the desired behavior is the key to conversion. With experience in reward programs, B2C and e-commerce services, Jenny will show you how to apply psychology and persuasive design patterns, and why they work. You will learn the underlying psychological principles that drive humans toward action, and how to win customers and keep them without Please-Don’t-Go pop-ups."
