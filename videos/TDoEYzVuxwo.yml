description: "Cache Strategies with Best Practices\n\nTao Cai, LinkedIn\n\nProblem statement\nIt's expensive to retrieve remote data in many data-intensive and latency-sensitive online services. A cache is widely used as a common practice to speed up the service. It's challenging to build an efficient cache and some bad cache implementations may break the system even more.\n\nProposal\nThis is a technical deep-dive about a set of cache strategies with real examples. We will describe Cache Item strategies, Multiple Cache TTL strategies, and Cache warm-up strategies. We'll explain how they significantly improve system performance while maintaining cache efficiency and increase availability. We will also share our practices in adopting those strategies.\n\nView the full SREcon21 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon21/program"
