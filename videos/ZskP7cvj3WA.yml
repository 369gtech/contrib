recordingDate: 1482430276
description: "Filmed at http://2016.dotcss.io on December 2nd in Paris. More talks on http://thedotpost.com\n\nWriting polyfills for CSS is much harder than it might seem. As a result, most polyfill authors today take shortcuts, which means the polyfills in widespread use are either too big, too slow, or too incorrect. Philip explores these challenges by writing a polyfill for a hypothetical new feature."
