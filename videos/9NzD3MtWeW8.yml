description: "Наша группа в ФБ: https://www.facebook.com/qafest/\nНаш сайт: www.qafest.com\n\nДоклад на конференции QA Fest 2017 в Киеве.\nFrom your own experience it might not come as a surprise that most of today’s testing is unhelpful, filled with unnecessary paper work and folkloric activities. For some reason testing work often does not seem to be very helpful in projects. That is definitely a problem. If you are a tester, your manager might ask you for metrics that don’t make sense to you. And since you are a smart person, you have probably once in a while gamed the system. All that is certainly damaging to the industry. What can you do? This session brings you insight into Complexity Thinking with Dave Snowden’s Cynefin model and ties that to your job as a software tester. It offers you a way to look at software testing from a complexity thinking standpoint of view and gives you tools to argue your case if you are exposed to dysfunctional project settings. In addition to that, we will have some fun with idiotic metrics and to lighten up the serious topic we’ll engage in hilariously entertaining real life examples of bad metrics. To round it up, we’ll propose more meaningful alternatives."
