title: 'Don''t trust the compiler to optimize - Reimar Döffinger'
recordingDate: 1549030356
description: "A walk-through and discussion of trivial code samples where compilers did or do generate anything from suboptimal to horribly badly performing code, illustrating the risks of relying on compiler optimizations. Examples will be primarily for x86_64 and gcc, even though any compiler has similar issues. Assembler code will be presented, so having looked at x86 assembler before would be useful but not necessary for understanding.\n\nReimar Döffinger is a software developer who a long time ago developed OpenSource multimedia software in C and assembler and now works a lot with C++ and thinking about how teams can be enabled to write better code. To compensate for all the sitting and thinking he spends a good bit of his free time organising hikes in the Skåne area.\n_________________\nFoo Café is a meeting place for people with an interest in software development and IT. \n\nHere, user groups and partner companies find the perfect atmosphere for sharing knowledge and develop competence. \n\nFoo Café is open for everyone and is free to attend. To make an event at Foo Café, you have to become a partner company with us or you can run a user group with an in-depth technical focus.\n\nWe welcome companies with sponsor challenges.\n\nWe are currently present in Stockholm and Malmö and have made over 2048 tech events since the start in 2012. \n\nAt Foo Café there’s an event going on everyday, year round."
