description: "Amit Easow (Comcast)\n\nAs Comcast has evolved from being a cable company to a media and technology leader, the engineering teams have also gotten smarter. When Amit joined Comcast Interactive Media (CIM) in 2006, they were a manual-testing shop. After they shipped their first website in 2007, he started creating prototypes for an automated UI-testing infrastructure. He was introduced to Selenium at GTAC 2008 and then returned to Comcast to build an automated testing infrastructure with Selenium Grid, Hudson and Subversion. Today, he works on API testing with deployments to Production every weekday. This is made possible with Python, Git, Gerrit and Anthill."
