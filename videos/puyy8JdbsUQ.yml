description: "DevDay (http://devday.pl),\n20th of September 2013, Krak√≥w\n\nRob Ashton - \"The software journeyman's guide to being homeless and jobless.\"\n\nDescription:\n\"We've all worked at 'that place' - you know the feeling; trudging through the same old problems every day, the same repetitive meetings, staring out of the window (if we're lucky enough to have one) and waiting for the day to end.  It can be hard to motivate ourselves to learn or try to change anything because it seems futile and eventually we'll either move on to the promise of something better or commit ourselves to the death march and move on with our lives.\n\nAfter nearly a decade of enterprise .NET development, I decided enough was enough - I quit my well-paid job in the middle of a meeting, threw away nearly everything I owned, abandoned my apartment and headed out in to the world to work for anybody for free providing they could fly me out to their location and put a roof over my head.\n\nI learned a lot of new technologies, I learned a lot about myself and I made a lot of new friends and contacts during the year of being a nomad - or a software journeyman if you will. \n\nI not only have a box of amusing anecdotes to dole out I have a large collection of both positive and negative experiences to share with the audience and perhaps I will encourage you to make a similar leap of faith in the future.\""
