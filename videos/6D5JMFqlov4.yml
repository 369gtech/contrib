description: "How Does Google Release Kubernetes in GKE - Kobi Magnezi & Josh Hoak, Google \n\nWorking on the GKE, we have been releasing new versions of Kubernetes since before Kubernetes was 1.0. Although closely related to the Kubernetes release, the release of Kubernetes in GKE involves ensuring fleet-wide consistency through upgrades, qualification and customer feedback. We will talk about the history of the GKE Release process and the lessons we have learned working with Kubernetes. We will close with open source improvements we're making to systems and tooling so that others can benefit from what we have learned. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPZ7"
