With years of experience building and maintaining the test suite, many techniques were used to get the run time down from over 30 minutes to under 5 minutes, allowing us to run the entire suite for every commit. Topics covered will include unit testing, WWW::Mechanize, Selenium, parallel testing, Test::Class and Moose load time.\n\n(Reading the talk online? Press \"S\" to see the speaker notes)."
