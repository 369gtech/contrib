title: '#AskTHAT Live with Jack Koppa - Open Source or Open Effort?'
recordingDate: 1525284648
description: "In this ver. @csell5 talks to @jackkoppa about getting involved in open source. Well really it quickly turns into talking about getting involved in open efforts. Something near and dear to #THATConference and #AskTHAT.\n\n\n\nJack is a Front-End Web Developer at SafeNet Consulting, who stumbled into software while studying environmental science & Chinese. Combining those three interests has led him to live in Shanghai, work on clean tech web apps, and contribute to an open-source air quality project; he's at his most excited when finding some helpful way to apply career-related skills. Though he's also pretty excited when discussing SpaceX. Currently working mostly with Angular 4+, TypeScript, Azure, and C#; dabbling in Node, React, and Next.\n\nFind Jack at:\n\nGitHub - https://github.com/jackkoppa\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/jackpkoppa\nEfforts Mentioned in Today's Show:\n\nOpenAQ - https://openaq.org\nOpenAQ Slack - https://openaq-slackin.herokuapp.com/\nFeedbot - Slack app for informal feedback - https://github.com/SafeNetConsulting-Milwaukee/feedbot"
