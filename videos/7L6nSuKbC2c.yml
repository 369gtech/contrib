description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nShh, It’s a Secret: Managing Your Secrets in a GitOps Way - Jake Wernette & Josh Kayani, IBM\n\nHow do you handle secrets? That is the first question that is asked whenever you are talking about GitOps. And it is a valid question! Do you put secrets directly in Git? Do you inject them in runtime? This is something that is trying to be answered across the community and in many different ways. Jake and his team at IBM looked at the landscape of GitOps specifically with Argo CD and could not find something that fit their needs. This talk will showcase how they were able to build and adopt argocd-vault-plugin and how it was able to simplify their secret management while allowing them to manage it in a GitOps way. Hopefully this talk will help you along in your GitOps journey and bridge the secrets gap that we are seeing so often in the community."
