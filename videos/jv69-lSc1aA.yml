description: "Schedule:  https://cloudnativesummit.online/schedule/\n\nMaintainers + Contributors + You!\nWe hope everyone is staying safe in this globally unique time.\n\nCloud native open source projects, SIGs, and working groups are core to many of our jobs. As we adjust to working from home and regaining productivity, a group of us figured it makes sense to convene on the interwebs to knowledge share. Using a hallway track format, experts from the community will come together to update each other on the latest cloud native technologies, updates on CNCF projects, and hands on technical sharing.\n\nThis event is envisioned, created, and executed by the community. Come join us!\n\nUpdates from all graduated CNCF projects - Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, Jaeger, Fluentd, Containerd, CoreDNS, Vitess, TUF\nA conversation between the key SIG and WG contributors\nAn update from CNCF on the upcoming cloud native technology\nSome happy gifs, jokes, and tips on remote work"
