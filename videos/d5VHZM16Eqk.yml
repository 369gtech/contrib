description: "Webcast Recording from Live Event\n\nWe'll start with a brief introduction to Service Design and cover a case study from an insurance company to demonstrate its key service design ideas and methods. Gjensidige- Norway's biggest insurance company—is a large organization dealing with an abstract \"product\" of insurance and financial services, but with outcomes that deeply affect people at critical moments in their lives. Building on Gjensidige's strategy to be completely customer centered, we will show you how a service blueprint can bring together groups—like Marketing and IT—that are often misaligned and at times at war. We'll also show you how cross-channel experience prototyping with customers and staff made two organizations (insurance and banking) feel like one to the customer.\n\nAt the end of the webcast, you will:\n\n    Have a basic understanding of Service Design\n    Understand the key differences between a services mindset and a product mindset\n    Know how service innovation is developed from insights and taken through to implement ion\n    Understand how the internal culture of an organization can be aligned with the goals of its customers\n\nAbout Lavrans Løvlie\n\nLavrans Løvlie has worked as a design consultant since 1994.
