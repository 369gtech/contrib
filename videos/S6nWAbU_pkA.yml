Due to these dramatic improvements the data being generated increased exponentially. While the first computer ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) took 24 hours to make a 24 hour integration weather forecast, right now at MeteoGroup we generate weather forecasts for next 10 days on the fly from the browser.
