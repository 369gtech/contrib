description: "Intro: Harbor - James Zabala & Henry Zhang, VMware \n\nAs container technology become widely adopted in the industry, how to manage containerized applications poses new challenges to platform engineers. One of the challenges is to securely and efficiently manage container images. Project Harbor is an open source trusted cloud native registry project that stores, signs, and scans content, thus resolving common image management challenges. In this presentation, we will focus on the management of container images through Harbor. We will review and provide solutions to challenges faced by organizations, including RBAC (Role Based Access Control), vulnerability scanning, large scale image distribution, image replication and image provenance (notary). Real world use cases will be discussed in the session. \n\nTo Learn More: https://sched.co/GrcE"
