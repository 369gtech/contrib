recordingDate: 1573074703
description: "Ever since we broke apart the front and back-end of our systems, weâ€™ve longed to partially reunite them with a shared language. The benefits of code reuse and shared tooling are compelling but is this nirvana possible?\n\nIn this session we will explore building both the front (mobile and web) and back-end of an application with a shared Kotlin codebase.\n\nYou will learn how to setup the build, share code, and deploy the back-end as a serverless app.\n\n\nJames Ward is a nerd / software developer who tries to share what he learns with others though presentations, blogs, demos, and code. After over two decades of professional programming, he is now a self-proclaimed Typed Pure Functional Programming zealot but often compromises on his ideals to just get stuff done. After spending too many sleepless nights in data centers repairing RAID arrays, he now prefers higher-level cloud abstractions with appropriate escape hatches. James is a huge Open Source proponent, hoping to never get burned by lock-in again.\n\nChet Haase is the Chief Advocate for Android at Google. He joined the Android team in 2010, led the Toolkit team for several years, and now spends his time helping developers to create better Android applications."
