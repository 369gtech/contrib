recordingDate: 1551726003
description: "The Metrics You Should Use But Probably Don't\n\nHave you ever had a gut feeling a project is about to go off course but no way to validate (or invalidate) that feeling? Has your team ever been burned by an inaccurate estimate or unreasonable expectation? Have you ever wished you could peer a bit into the future?\nNavigating the uncertainty of knowledge work is often difficult and uncomfortable. During this session, you’ll learn new ways to visualize your team’s reliability and variability of delivery using the data you already collect. Instead of relying entirely on your gut or laboring over estimates, you’ll learn to predict outcomes and describe their likelihood. While this session won’t teach you to eliminate uncertainty or allow you to see the future, it will provide you with tools to explore and chart a reasonable course through the inherent ambiguity of knowledge work.\n\nCat is a consultant specializing in lean inspired, data informed coaching for technology organizations. She is passionate about increasing diversity in STEAM as a means of creating the possibility of a more equitable human future based on generative institutions. In her leisure time, Cat enjoys making jokes about Bitcoin, hiking, and reading feminist literature.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
