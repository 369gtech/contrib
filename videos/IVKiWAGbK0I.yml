But how much control have you actually given up? Can you monitor the user experience of your app? Can you still profile your app? Did you even discuss SLI/SLO/SLA in the first place?\n\nDevOps isn’t going away with serverless, it’s actually becoming even more important with CI/CD and blue/green deployments remaining key best practices.\n\nIn this session we’ll discuss the importance of proper DevOps principles (SRE at Google) and demonstrate Application Performance Monitoring (APM) tooling for serverless development.\n\n \nAlexis Moussine-Pouchkine \nFrom Google\nJava and Sun Microsystem veteran, now at Google focusing on GCP, Serverless, and Java"
