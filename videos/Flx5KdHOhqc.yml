title: 'DEF CON 26 - William Martin - One Click to OWA'
language: English
recordingDate: 1540249664
description: "With the presense of 2FA/MFA solutions growing, the attack surface for external attackers that have successfully phished/captured/cracked credentials is shrinking. However, many 2FA/MFA solutions leave gaps in their coverage which can allow attackers to leverage those credentials. For example, while OWA may be protected with 2FA, the Exchange Web Services Management API (EWS) offers many of the same features and functionalities without the same protections.\n\nIn this talk, I will introduce ExchangeRelayX, an NTLM relay tool that provides attackers with access to an interface that resembles a victim's OWA UI and has many of its functionalities - without ever cracking the relayed credentials.  ExchangeRelayX takes advantage of the gap in some 2FA/MFA solutions protecting Exchange, potentially resulting in a single-click phishing scheme enabling an attacker to exfiltrate sensitive data, perform limited active-directory enumeration, and execute further internal phishing attacks."
