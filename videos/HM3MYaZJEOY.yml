description: 'Software developers can be divided into two groups: those who think that their manager sucks, and those who believe that managers are not needed at all. Managers can be divided into two groups too: those who think that they know how to write software and those who know how to deliver the product. In this talk weâ€™ll discuss all points of views to put your mind at ease and come up with a definition of a good manager and a good employee.'
