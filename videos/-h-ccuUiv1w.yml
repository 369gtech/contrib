description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2013\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nMark Madsen - Thirdnature\n\nABSTRACT\nIt makes good sense to follow Google's lead with technology. Not because what Google does is particularly complex; it isn't. We follow Google for two reasons:\n1. Google is operating at an unprecedented scale and every mistake they make is one we don't have to repeat, while every good decision they make (defined as \"decisions that stick\") is one we should probably emulate;\n2. Google is as strong an attractor of brainpower and development talent as IBM's labs once were; that much intellectual horsepower -- even if a large part of it is frittered away on the likes of Wave, Buzz, Lively and Aardvark -- produces value, ultimately for all of us.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
