description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2014\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nAino Vonge Corry - Retrospectives Facilitator\nTroels Richter - Agile Coach, Trifork Software Pilot and Micropreneur\n\nABSTRACT\nWhy is it that so many teams spend a lot of effort planning, estimating, and building a velocity but still can't reach the sprint goal?\n\nWhy is it that so many teams are practicing standup meetings every morning even though it does not necessarily add value to each and every one participating?\n\nAgile practices are widely used and most of us see it as a sign of health and agility even though thousands of companies are struggling to make it work.\n\nMaybe it is possible to establish a agile culture without using agile processes, and maybe it is possible to replace or even draw back existing agile practices and still optimize for agility?\n\nThroughout the last couple of years, Troels Richter (Agile Coach) and Aino Vonge Corry (Agile Facilitator) has had similar experiences indicating that agile practices can have a negative effect on agility and that agility can be practiced without knowing about Scrum or Kanban.\n\nThe only problem is that it is undermining everything they have believed until now and maybe they have to admit that there is something about it when Prag-Dave Thomas (co-author of the agile manifesto) recently claimed that \"Agile is Dead\" \n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
