This is part 2, where we wire up our Minimal API for full CRUD access. If you missed part 1, go back and check it out.\n\nFull Training Courses: https://IAmTimCorey.com\nSource Code: https://leadmagnets.app/?Resource=MinimalAPIPart2\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/IAmTimCorey\nMailing List:  https://signup.iamtimcorey.com/"
