Announcing the Go Programming Language Sep 2019 meetup!\r\n\r\nTalks for the night:\r\n7pm \"Concurrency in Data Streaming Pipeline\" - by Gentur\r\n\r\nData Pipelining is a common term used when a data is “moved” from one data\r\nsource to another. During this moving process, we may want to do things with it,\r\nsuch as transforming into another data structure, or filtering some of the data.\r\n\r\nOne commonplace requirement of the data streaming pipeline is that we need to\r\nmaintain the order for particular data from the beginning until the end. Take,\r\nfor example, when we want to make a replica of our database into a cache by\r\ntracking the data changes in the database.\r\n\r\nThis talk will cover how we create a high-performance data pipeline in Golang\r\nthat maintains the order in which the data came up until the receiving end by\r\nleveraging concurrency.\r\n\r\n8pm \"Building your web service into one binary file\" - by Jay\r\n\r\nGo applications are easily deployed because they are statically compiled. But it\r\nis tedious to manage many static assets (images, etc) that are needed in a web\r\nservice. One solution is to compile the necessary files into a binary. Jay will\r\nshare about using the go-bindata library (\r\nhttps://github.com/kevinburke/go-bindata\r\n[https://github.com/kevinburke/go-bindata]) to build a single binary file that\r\ncontains the server and website. And finally, how we dockerize it and deploy to\r\na server.\r\n\r\nVenue & Food Sponsor:\r\nShopee Singapore\r\n\r\nAbout our speakers:\r\nGentur Waskito T joined Shopee in 2018. He enjoys working at Shopee as a place\r\nto learn and grow together with the Shared Service Team.\r\n\r\nJay (Yen-Chieh) is a software developer at Nulab’s office in NYC. He is part of\r\nthe Cacoo team and works primarily with Java and Go. He recently helped to\r\nmigrate Cacoo website's backend rendering system to the Golang-based Gin\r\nframework.\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/golangsg/events/264447842/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\r\nRecorded by:\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/BHoX6/"
