description: "Operating PCF via Concourse. Or, How to Sleep More and Worry Less - Therese Stowell & Ryan Pei, Pivotal & Yuri Litvinovich, Scotiabank\n\nCloud Foundry has a lot of knobs and dials. If you’re an operations team, how can you ensure that you have declarative, repeatable processes for installation, upgrade, and disaster recovery? Leveraging published Concourse pipelines turns operations from snowflake-creation to push-button rinse & repeat.\n\nThis talk will feature both the folks building CF and the folks operating CF. They’ll discuss and demonstrate using Concourse to install, upgrade, and manage disaster recovery on CF, including DR strategies like active-inflate aimed at reducing recovery time. They’ll give real world examples of how they manage multiple CF installations and can offer CF as a Product to their app developers, with guaranteed SLAs and well defined RTOs. And they’ll discuss reference architectures that accommodate CF, Credhub, and Concourse. \n\nAbout Therese Stowell\nTherese Stowell is Product Manager at Pivotal. She has worked in the software industry for 20+ years as programmer, interface designer, and product manager.
