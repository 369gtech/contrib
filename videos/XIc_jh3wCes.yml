description: 'Sarah Young, gender historian turned software developer, delves into the issue of ''imposter syndrome''. What is it and what do I do if I have it? Is it a ''real'' condition or just an imposter? Using what we know about how the brain works and how humans learn, Sarah unpacks the imposter syndrome in order to challenge the typical understanding of what has become a tech culture buzzword. This talk was given at a Pivotal Lunch & Learn in London on 29 November 2017.'
