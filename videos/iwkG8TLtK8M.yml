It covers the management, control, and organization of a project. A qualification in PRINCE2® will not only boost your skills and confidence when managing projects but will greatly improve your employment prospects. The majority of people that consider PRINCE2® as a qualification do so for career and personal development reasons. Often this is driven by a change of job or career, where you notice that to get to the top of the CV pile, you need to have an extra qualification like PRINCE2® (even if you have been managing Projects successfully for many years without it). In many advertised positions PRINCE2® has become a pre-requisite.\n\nCompany:\nThe majority of companies that implement PRINCE2® also encourage their employees to receive training and take exams. This often proves instrumental in facilitating the successful adoption and implementation of the PRINCE2® method into an organization. By training employees to the required qualification level you ensure a consistent approach, common language and a clear understanding of the defined processes, controls, roles and responsibilities required to help facilitate successful projects.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------  \n\nGot a question on the topic? \nPlease share it in the comment section below and our experts will answer it for you.\n\nPlease write back to us at sales@edureka.in or call us at IND: 9606058406 / US: 18338555775 (toll-free) for more information."
