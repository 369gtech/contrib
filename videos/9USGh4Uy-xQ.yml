description: "John Reese\n\nhttps://2018.pycon-au.org/talks/45063-refactoring-code-with-the-standard-library/\n\nWhat if you could refactor your entire code base, safely and automatically? How much old code could you fix or replace if you didn't need to worry about updating every reference by hand? I'll show you how a concrete syntax tree (CST) can help you do just that using only the standard Python library.\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, australia, programming, sydney\n\nThis video is licensed under CC BY 3.0 AU - https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/au/\r\n\r\nPyCon Australia (“PyCon AU”) is the national conference for the Python Programming Community, bringing together professional, student and enthusiast developers with a love for developing with Python.\n\nPyCon AU, the national Python Language conference, is on again this August in Sydney, at the International Convention Centre, Sydney, August 24 - 28 2018.\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU"
