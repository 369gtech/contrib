For an industry-standard latency-sensitive benchmark it achieves throughput over 36% higher than the existing JDK collectors while never exceeding a maximum pause time of two milliseconds. In this session we’ll explain how ZGC achieves this performance, and show how to use it.\n\nErik Österlund \nFrom Oracle\nErik is a member of the HotSpot Garbage Collection team at Oracle who has been working on HotSpot for over five years. He is an OpenJDK Reviewer, and a contributor to the ZGC project."
