description: "Presented by Javier Fontan, Senior Software Developer, source[d]\n\nAt source{d} we analyze a huge amount of git repositories and extract insights on source code. To do this we have created a powerful engine for language-agnostic analysis of your source code and git history. The git history part of the analysis is handled by Gitbase, an SQL database engine that is able to understand git repositories and is MySQL protocol compatible. You'll learn about our journey, from what began as a side project to the current state, its internals and the different solutions we approached.\n\nAbout GitMerge\nGit Merge is the pre-eminent Git-focused conference: a full-day offering technical content and user case studies, plus a day of workshops for Git users of all levels. Git Merge is dedicated to amplifying new voices in the Git community and to showcasing the most thought-provoking projects from contributors, maintainers and community managers around the world.
