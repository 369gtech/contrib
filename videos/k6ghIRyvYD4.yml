title: 'Using Metrics to Ensure Quality Applications in Pivotal Platform'
language: English
recordingDate: 1571603161
description: "We'll explain how metrics are vital in the development process and monitoring of production applications. Knowing how your application is performing throughout the development cycle while help ensure that when your application makes it to production it performs as expected. We'll explain what metrics to look for, and how these metrics may be created. We'll demonstrate in a Pivotal Platform environment how to set up automatic service discovery with Eureka, auto scaling problems of ephemeral microservices, how to configure Prometheus to gather metrics from multiple service instances, configuring Grafana to show these metrics, and lastly how to use your own metrics outside of what we get in micrometer for custom metrics important to your business. This topic is for intermediate developers with experience in Pivotal Platform and Spring Cloud Services who want to monitor all of their microservices. \n\nSpeaker(s): \nSam Reed, Software Engineer, Charles Schwab; Tom Martin, Sr Staff, Software Applications Engineer, Charles Schwab\n\nSlideShare: https://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/using-metrics-to-ensure-quality-applications-in-pivotal-platform\n\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2019"
