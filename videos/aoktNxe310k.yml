recordingDate: 1308608455
description: "Paul Querna (Rackspace), \n\nCast is an open source platform for deploying and managing applications being developed by Rackspace.  Cast is the bridge between traditional configuration management like Puppet or Chef, and the longer term shift to Platforms as a Service.  Cast is written in Node.js, built entirely on top of HTTP APIs for easy control, and has plugins and hooks to make customization trivial."
