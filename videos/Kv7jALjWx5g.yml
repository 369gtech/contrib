description: "This presentation was recorded at Chicago's GOTO Night \nhttp://gotochgo.com\n\nReid Draper - Director of Engineering at Helium\n\nABSTRACT\nTransactions are a mainstay of modern database theory, economics, and concurrency control. At the core of transactions is the notion of an atomic, or indivisible unit -- a transaction is either wholly applied, or not. Typically, however, transactions don't compose in our programming languages. We can run two transactions back-to-back, but we can't combine two transactions into one. Sadly, this limits just how reusable a transaction is.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOChgo\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
