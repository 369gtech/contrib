description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2020 by Jamie Adkins, Pulselive.\n\nMore info: https://android-makers-2020.firebaseapp.com/schedule/?sessionId=168081\n\nCreating an Android project that is decoupled enough to be able to release an individual feature as an instant app is a tough ask. It becomes even more daunting when your starting point is a monolithic, single module project. In this talk we’ll go over how we modularised the Cricket World Cup 2019 app in order to release an instant app, and we’ll show every single problem we hit along the way."
