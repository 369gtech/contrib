description: "You’ve probably heard that “functional programming is the next big thing” and that modern imperative languages like C# and JavaScript are adopting features from functional programming. So how can you, as a developer living in a normal imperative code base, start taking advantage of functional programming from where you are now, without needing to throw yourself in the deep end and change languages?\n\nIn this talk we’ll take a look at functional programming libraries that already exist in .NET and JavaScript, such as LINQ/lodash and Rx/RxJS, and walk through practical examples of imperative code that could be written in a more functional style in order to produce more concise, readable and maintainable code.\n\nOnce you get a taste of functional programming, you won’t want to go back. :)"
