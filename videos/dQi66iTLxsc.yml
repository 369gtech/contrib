description: "Predictive maintenance helps to predict problems and optimize the maintenance life cycle. Using data science to solve mechanical issues - revolutionizes the world of machines.\n\nIn today’s world of machines, there are two leading maintenance techniques. They support a standard machine life cycle. Predictive maintenance revolutionizes the future of machines. It tracks each of the machines’ unique life cycle and doesn’t generalize. It allows us to know if they need to be attended to in advance. This maintenance method provides information on upcoming, unknown or unpredicted critical failures. It creates an effective and innovative environment. Using data science to solve predictive maintenance revolutionizes the way we look at machines. It changes the data collection approach, enhances its quality and allows proper usage of the collected data. In a world full of machines, we need to be the bridge connecting the methods of the past to the opportunities of the future.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks, courses, and conferences in the following links:\nhttps://ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
