description: "??ATTENTION ??\nRegistration to ?DevTernity 2018 is running:\n? https://devternity.com\n\nGraphQL is riding the hype wave right now. Yet many developers don't understand how they could benefit from it or where it fits into their stack. I'll introduce core concepts and give a practical demo how you can use GraphQL with React & Apollo. I'll also outline major advantages of GraphQL so you can convince your manager and developer friends to use it in your next project."
