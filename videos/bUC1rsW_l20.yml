description: "JMS is widely used behind enterprise firewalls to build loosely coupled distributed systems. This session discusses how JMS can be extended and applied to an always connected Web and mobile environment to provide interactivity and collaboration by controlling physical objects, such as model cars, remotely. You’ll learn how you can connect an HTML5 client running on the Web browser of a smartphone and Java running on a Raspberry Pi, a credit-card-size computer, in real time, using open industry-standard Web technologies. The presentation features several live demonstrations of the concepts discussed throughout the session.\n\n\nAuthors:\nDavid Witherspoon\nA Software Engineer at Kaazing Corporation\nView more trainings by David Witherspoon at https://www.parleys.com/author/david-witherspoon\n\nPrashant Khanal\nA software engineer at Kaazing Corporation.\nView more trainings by Prashant Khanal at https://www.parleys.com/author/prashant-khanal\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
