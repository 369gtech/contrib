description: "JavaScript provides primitive types and means of processing those. However, those are not enough. Real data must somehow come into the program and data must somehow leave the program, for it to become useful to us. In this talk, we will see how two abstractions are essential for data flow and to build up other abstractions, such as Iterator, Iterable, Observable, Scheduling, and others.\n\nWorkshop Material: https://github.com/staltz/uphill-rxjs-training\n\nTalk was recorded 2018 at https://uphillconf.com"
