title: 'Crafting Inclusive Environments (Meri Williams, 2019)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1636120684
description: "It's well known that diverse teams are more creative and deliver better results. These results have been played out in repeated studies and in bottom line financial results of companies across many industries. Sadly many organisations lag behind in adequately representing the population, but those that are making strides are also outperforming the competition.\n\nSo you know WHY but what about the HOW? In this talk, Meri explores a framework for how to think about diversity and inclusion, and practical things you can go and do to make your organisation and culture genuinely inclusive. Because thatâ€™s the only way to attract, recruit, promote and most importantly retain a wide range of people. And THAT is the only way to have the highest-performing teams possible.\n\nWatch thousands more tech talks in our SkillsCast library at https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts"
