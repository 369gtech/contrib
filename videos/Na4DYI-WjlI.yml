description: "Human beings experience sound in all directions—like when a fire truck zooms by, or when an airplane is overhead. The Google VR SDK enables mobile developers to create equally immersive spatial audio experiences in virtual reality (VR). Come join the Google VR Audio team to learn how immersive audio works and why it is a powerful tool for guiding users through the VR experiences you create by capturing their attention in a natural, intuitive way. In this talk, we will discuss the background and key aspects of spatial audio perception, virtual sound object rendering and acoustic room models in mobile VR.\n\nCheck out this video that demonstrates how the Google VR spatial audio engine reacts to the listener position and changes in the environment in real-time (headphones required): https://youtu.be/I9zf4hCjRg0\n\nSee all the talks from Google I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/olw6kV\nWatch more Android talks at I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/Uv3jls\nWatch more Chrome talks at I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/JoMLpB\nWatch more Firebase talks at I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/JTH9Fr \nSubscribe to the Google Developers Channel: http://goo.gl/mQyv5L \n\n#io16 #GoogleIO #GoogleIO2016"
