title: 'Nordic.js 2018 • Sandi Barr - Using TypeScript with Redux Architecture'
language: English
recordingDate: 1544608487
description: "Functional reactive programming is based on the idea that applications can be built around streams. The structure TypeScript imposes provides us with a declarative syntax that gives semantic meaning to the streams of events and commands our application uses to build state in redux architecture. There is some boilerplate required to pull this off, but it is worth it for large scale applications, examples in Ngrx with Angular.\n\n\nSandi Barr\nSandi has been a developer in various industries from the financial markets, agriculture, defense, and now podcasting. She enjoys sharing her expertise and experience with others in the software field and founded local organizations for girls and women to create a sense of belonging and help them excel in tech. She's run Django Girls and Node School workshops in Omaha and helps organize the Nebraska JavaScript Conference. When not doing all that, she'd rather be out on her Boosted Board.\n\n\nNordic.js is a single track conference with talks by internationally renowned speakers and rising stars in the JavaScript community.
