description: "Presented at droidcon Italy 2020\n\nBUILDING AR EXPERIENCES ON ANDROID WITH AZURE SPATIAL ANCHORS\nAdora Nwodo, Software Engineer, Microsoft\n\nIn recent times, we have seen solutions that Perception, AI and Mixed Reality brings. These solutions are allowing us to interact with computers differently using Augmented, Virtual and Mixed Realities. How about being able to use these intelligent solutions to create experiences in these realities beyond headsets? How about we create these intelligent, shared and spatially-aware realities on our mobile phones instead?\n\nAzure Spatial Anchors (being one of these solutions) provides an SDK that we can use to build spatially-aware, enterprise-ready applications for AR across the Microsoft HoloLens, Android and iOS.\n\nAre you an Android developer looking to learn how to build shared AR experiences where different people could see (and possibly interact with) the same digital objects while using multiple devices in the same location? In this talk, we’d see how to use native mobile tools and cloud services like Azure Spatial Anchors to build these exciting AR experiences that people love.\n\nhttps://it.droidcon.com/2020/​​​​\nhttps://twitter.com/Droidconit​​​​\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/showcase/dro​​​​...\nhttps://www.instagram.com/droidconit/​​​​\nhttps://www.facebook.com/droidconIt"
