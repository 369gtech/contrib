description: "Spreadsheets are a great utility in the business world, a virtual swiss army knife for what they can do with data, turning it into information. While presentations aren't able to manipulate data in the way a spreadsheet can, they do take information & make it more visually appealing & more easily understood by human beings. In this video, Google engineer Wesley Chun shows you how to import spreadsheet data into presentations by using both the Google Sheets and Slides APIs. With these APIs, you can develop powerful apps that can automate this process between both types of apps so users no longer have to do this by hand.\n\nLinks:\nGoogle Sheets API codelab: http://g.co/codelabs/sheets\nExplore in Docs, Sheets, and Slides release announcement (Sep 2016): http://goo.gl/GmDAPp\nGoogle APIs Client Libraries: http://goo.gl/3vknAI\nGoogle APIs Python client library: http://goo.gl/SJ3zGJ\nGoogle Developers Console: http://console.developers.google.com\n“Transferring data from a SQL database to a Sheet” DevByte video: http://goo.gl/N1RPwC\nDeeper dive code review of script used in this DevByte: http://goo.gl/Fa34S3\nTable operations in presentations: http://goo.gl/mD7oaN\nAdding charts to presentations: http://goo.gl/9T3Dao\nOverview of the Google Slides API: http://goo.gl/gIqivd\nCommon operations & API samples: http://goo.gl/JFGs3Z\nSlides API reference documentation: http://goo.gl/8QXk7N\nSlides API quickstarts in Python & other languages: http://goo.gl/hoRi0Q\nSlides API developers launch announcement (Nov 2016): http://goo.gl/o6EFwk\nSlides API launch announcement (Nov 2016): http://goo.gl/UA2pRJ\n“Setting up new Google API projects” DevByte video: http://goo.gl/RbyTFD\n“Common Python code walkthrough” DevByte video: http://goo.gl/KMfbeK\n\nWatch more episodes of G Suite Dev Show: http://goo.gl/JpBQ40\nSubscribe to the Google Developers YouTube channel: http://youtube.com/GoogleDevelopers"
