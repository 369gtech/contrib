description: "Check out this concert featuring musician, rapper, and producer Mega Ran from GDC Summer! A former teacher, Mega Ran (formerly Random) blends education, hip-hop and gaming in amazing new ways, penetrating the farthest reaches of the galaxy with his unique rhyme style and electric performances. The first ever rap artist to be licensed by a major game developer (Capcom), Ran takes the old and makes it new through his unique form of music he calls “Chip-Hop.” Arguably the world’s most well known video-game influenced performance artist, Mega Ran’s high-energy shows and fun, nerdy persona have led to speaking engagements, world tours, tons of convention and festival performances, and a legion of smart fans.\n\nThis performance is presented by Video Games In Concert (https://gamemusic.rocks/).
