description: "In this talk we'll go over everything you need to know about RuboCop - a powerful Ruby static code analyzer that makes it easy for you to enforce a consistent code style throughout your Ruby projects.\n\nWe'll begin by examining the events that lead to the creation of RuboCop, its early days and its evolution, effective RuboCop usage and some of its cool but little-known features. Then we'll continue with a brief look into RuboCop's internals and show you how easy it is to extend its functionality.\n\nWe'll wrap the talk with a glimpse inside RuboCop's future and discuss some of the challenges the project faces and some of the work that remains to be done, before RuboCop finally reaches the coveted 1.0 version."
