language: English
recordingDate: 1639652430
description: "In this episode, Codurance co-founders Sandro Mancuso and Mashooq Badar and Spain's Managing Director José E. Rodríguez Huerta went deeper into the discussion on estimation, addressing some of the comments we received on YouTube and Twitter. \n\nIf you would like us to discuss a topic, please let us know in the comments and we will do our best to address it in a future episode. Any topics around Agile, Software Craftsmanship, Extreme Programming, technical practices, thought leadership, architecture, management, team dynamics, or anything related to technology or software projects are welcome. \n\nThe idea of the Fireside chat series is to record informal conversations we normally have outside working hours. Topics are normally decided just before we start recording. Our objective is to have spontaneous conversations instead of something more structured or scripted. \n\nFor more information about Codurance, please visit our website: https://codurance.com/."
