description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nThe Hitchhiker's Guide to Kubernetes Vulnerabilities - Robert Clark & Micah Hausler, Amazon\n\nThe earth is gone. You’re the only one left. Was Kubernetes to blame? Is prior performance a strong indicator of future behavior? Is Kubernetes on a positive security trajectory? Have community efforts improved security? The speakers will present research that examines security problems throughout the entire history of the Kubernetes project. They explore patterns and trends in the data. They show a taxonomy for classifying k8s vulnerabilities; including analysis of root causes and contributing factors. They dive into each issue, examining metrics like time from commit-to-discovery, time-to-resolution, detection of similar events etc. They look to patterns of previous behavior to help the audience predict future performance. They interview leaders in the community and overlay historical security data with efforts to improve security. They show the impact SIGs, WGs, Audits, etc had on k8s security and suggest how the security posture of k8s might evolve in the future."
