description: "Accessible by law! Generating colors with JS and CSS Custom Properties\n\nIn Norway, all websites are required by law to be accessible. Thanks to the Norwegian regulations, accessibility cannot be treated as \"\"nice to have\"\" - it's a \"\"must have.\"\" But since we were white-label service, we were faced with two must-haves: Our customers should be able to pick any color as their brand color, but on the other hand, colors should have sufficient contrast according to the WCAG criteria. The solution came combining CSS Custom Properties with a sprinkle of JavaScript, which meant we could automatically create a color palette.\n\n\nIngvild Indrebø\nIngvild is a Senior Developer at the video conferencing startup Confrere. She fell in love with coding after realising code makes it possible for her to to do something good for not just one person at the time - but for everyone that might be using what she built. Before joining Confrere, she worked 4 years at BEKK Consulting, specializing in frontend. A fun fact: even after working in a video conferencing startup, she still finds video conversations slightly awkward.\n\n\nNordic.js is a single track conference with talks by internationally renowned speakers and rising stars in the JavaScript community.
