description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2019 by Pierre-Yves Ricau, Square, Inc.\n\nMore info: http://androidmakers.fr/schedule/?sessionId=LWJ-6534\n\nLeakCanary 2 Alpha 1 will be released right before this talk, come learn about hot new features, crazy improvements and gnarly implementation details!\n\nLeakCanary 1 helped detect memory leaks but had several issues: constant freeze of the UI, OOM crashes while analyzing, results hard to analyze, a confusing API, and an ugly logo.\n\nNo more! Come learn about multiple leak detection, leak grouping, smarter analysis results, counting leaks in production, detecting leaks in UI tests... and much more!\n\nOh and LeakCanary 2 is 100% Kotlin, updated to Android X, and it even has a cute new logo!\n\nAlex Karp Production"
