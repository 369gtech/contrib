description: "Video from Devoxx Poland 2019.\n\nLanguage Paradigms are intriguing, some languages are pure and enforce a particular paradigm, and yet some languages are hybrid. A single paradigm language is consistent, easier to use, and often favored by the proponents of the promoted paradigm. Hybrid languages often appear confusing, seem harder to use, and yet there are so many of them. From the programming point of view should we stick to one paradigm or should we dabble into the mixed paradigm arena? It turns out, that is not an easy question."
