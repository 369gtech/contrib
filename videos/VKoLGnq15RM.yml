language: English
recordingDate: 1509473639
description: "Geoffrey Hinton (who popularized backpropagation in the 80s) recently published his long-awaited paper on \"Capsule Networks\" - which provide state of the art classification accuracy on the MNIST dataset. In this video I'll go over how Convolutional networks work, some improvements to them over the years, then i'll go over capsule networks in both theory and code.\n\nCode for this video: \nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/capsule_networks\n\nPlease Subscribe!
