description: "This talk will cover the latest updates for adding 3D to your web site. You'll learn how to use model-viewer and new features for rendering, AR, and interactivity. You'll also see some phenomenal sites created with three.js. Then you'll get an overview of the WebGPU API that will provide modern features such as “GPU compute” as well as lower overhead access to GPU hardware and better, more predictable performance. Expect performance gains in Tensorflow.js up to 10x.\n\nWebsites featured:\nROME by Google Creative Lab → https://goo.gle/2LIHkpy\nTrack by Little Workshop → https://goo.gle/2WESqwQ\nPlume by Fabien Motte, Patrick Heng, Alexadre Delalleau, Nicolas Mathis and Mohave → https://goo.gle/2Viydvr\nOat the Goat by Assembly and FCB New Zealand → https://goo.gle/2JF4NW3\nWebVR Showroom by Little Workshop → https://goo.gle/2JhK6QD\nHinderer & Wolff by Adelios → https://goo.gle/30ev3N3\nBertrand Candas → https://goo.gle/2VzSyBv\nTao Tajima by Homunculus → https://goo.gle/2Q4Fo9t\nRobin Mastromarino by Patrick Heng → https://goo.gle/2W1xByz\nReact Three Fiber by Paul Henschel → https://goo.gle/2VotAjk\nWebGL Globe by Google Data Arts Team → https://goo.gle/2E7doxj\nModel Viewer by Chrome DevXR → https://goo.gle/2HlFqWI\nModel Viewer Layout Test by Chrome DevXR → https://goo.gle/2HhOeOf\nNASA Mars Curiosity Rover → https://goo.gle/2WESFYM\n\nMore projects at:\nhttps://goo.gle/2Yygwdt\nhttps://goo.gle/2HlFGFa\n\nWatch more #io19 here: \nWeb at Google I/O 2019 Playlist → https://goo.gle/io19web\nGoogle I/O 2019 All Sessions Playlist → https://goo.gle/io19allsessions \nLearn more on the I/O Website → https://google.com/io\n\nSubscribe to the Chrome Developers Channel → https://goo.gle/ChromeDevs\nGet started at → https://www.google.com/chrome/dev/\n\nSpeaker(s): Corentin Wallez, Ricardo Cabello\n\nT4CDD1"
