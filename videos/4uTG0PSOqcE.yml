description: "Web animation has dominated conversations for the last few years. Front-end developers and interaction designers are hungry to provide more value than just arranging boxes and text on screen. Users have come to expect UI animation as a standard. This talk will show you how to use Adobe After Effects as a prototyping tool to create cutting edge UX animation. We will dissect practical examples of prototyping for desktop, mobile and installations. This process allows for rapid discovery, giving front-end developers and interaction designers the ability to achieve new standards and push the web forward, without wasting countless hours juggling complex code libraries.\n\nRon Edelen\nPartner + Design Director, Myjive\nhttps://twitter.com/ronedelen\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/ronedelen\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
