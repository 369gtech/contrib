description: "Speaker: Shauna Gordon-McKeon\n\nFinished with the official Django getting started guide, and not sure what to do next?  This tutorial has you covered.  \n\nWe'll extend the blog built in the official guide, using a variety of slightly more advanced Django features.  Topics to be covered include: extending the in-built user model, using the in-built login system, enhancing forms, using view mixins and overriding view methods, and changing up your database backend.  \n\nWith each extension, we'll talk about not just how to use these features but also *why* you'd want to use them.  We'll conclude by talking about other Django features you may want to learn about as you grow more proficient with this versatile framework.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2018 and https://github.com/PyCon/2018-slides"
