description: "No application will ever have zero bugs, but you sure want to keep them to a minimum. The best way to do this is to implement automated regression tests of your code, but \"best\" as usual does not equate to \"easiest.\" Building and managing tests can be a big challenge, so in this Office Hours session, we will hear from developers who are doing just that. Learn from your peers about the obstacles they faced and how they overcame them. Bring your own stories and your questions, and let's all work together on improving our code quality!\n\nHighlights (see details on each speaker below):\n\n01:43 - Testing challenges and introducing the speakers\n04:51 - Jasmin Fluri on lessons from two projects with automated testing\n16:44 - Deepthi Bandari on the joys and challenges of automated testing\n24:57 - Swathi Ambati and Maik Becker - run and monitor utPLSQL tests with APEX\n36:38 - Patrick Barel and SQL Developer unit testing\n46:50 - Samuel Nitsche on how to use testing to explore unknown functionality in a legacy app\n\nPresenter Backgrounds:\n\nJasmin Fluri: an independent consultant at Schaltstelle GmbH and lectures on software engineering and code review at the University of Applied Sciences North-western Switzerland. Her focus as a database developer and DevOps engineer lies on continuous integration and delivery pipelines, automation of recurring tasks, PL/SQL development, data engineering, and data warehousing.\n\nMaik Becker and Swathi Ambati of Triology: Swathi (@smreddy19) is an Oracle Database and Application Developer. Recently she started developing Database Applications using Oracle APEX and she is always eager to learn and implement new ideas to do her work more productively and innovatively. Maik (@beckerman_maik) is responsible for Oracle Database Development and Application Express at TRIOLOGY. With his passion for Oracle APEX he is always focused on the business cases of his customers.\n\nDeepthi Bandari, a senior software engineer at Fidelity Investments, will share some of her joys and challenges when it comes to unit testing, test automation and promoting engineering excellent.\n\nPatrick Barel is a PL/SQL Developer for Qualog in the Netherlands. Besides working with SQL and PL/SQL he wrote different plug-ins for PL/SQL Developer, publishes articles on his own blog and is an Oracle ACE Director. Patrick is going to show what he's been doing with SQL Developer unit testing features and SQLcl commands.\n\nSamuel Nitsche of the utPLSQL team, a curiosity-driven software-developer with nearly 20 years of development experience, working at Smart Enterprise Solutions GmbH, a small software company in southern Germany. In his free time he writes regularly about database development and testing topics, presents at meetups and conferences (gladly in sith-robe) and works on making the framework \"even more awesome.\""
