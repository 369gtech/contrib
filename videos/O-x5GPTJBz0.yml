recordingDate: 1492500534
description: "Unless you work for a web agency where you have an art director and a team of web-designers, it is probably you, the developer, who has to make sure that the sophisticated web application you are building looks visually stunning on any internet connected device.\nIn this session you will see how your web application can look attractive on computers, tablets and smartphones by delivering a responsive user interface. Weâ€™ll investigate CSS media queries and some ready to go responsive CSS Frameworks like Bootstrap, but you will also see how to create reusable CSS by using the CSS preprocessor LESS and how to add images without going (completely) mad with Adobe Photoshop."
