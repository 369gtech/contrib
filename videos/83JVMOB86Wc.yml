description: "Augmenting the Org for DevOps\n\nStephanie Gillespie, SVP, Head of Digital Channel Technology, KeyBank \nJohn Rzeszotarski, Director of Continuous Delivery, KeyBank \n\nYear two in our DevOps journey is all about scaling out our success. We had an amazing year last year where we helped accelerate an acquisition of another bank with a continuous delivery process and modernization of our platforms. So much so our CIO called it out in a \"Wall Street Journal\" article http://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2017/03/23/keycorp-cio-develops-digital-construction-zone/?platform=hootsuite \n\nWhat we needed to do now was move out of a bi-modal approach and collaborate this into the rest of the organization. That drove us to reviewing how we got where we are, and utilizing lean concepts to drive us where we need to be. Our story is about how we took a highly distributed and silo’s organization and start breaking it into teams that are organized to how we build solutions, aka Conway’s Law. We will also talk about the next steps for us enabling quicker and more stable releases by taking what we did with application and web server technologies and tackle it for databases. \n\nThere is a lot in progress right now but the entire company now is embracing DevOps in all parts of the organization, we still have a lot of work to do like internal DevOps days and building that culture of curiosity but starting out by positioning folks in a place to embrace these changes is exciting for us.\n\nHere is the link the CNBC Mad Money show with Jim Cramer that is mentioned in this video.
