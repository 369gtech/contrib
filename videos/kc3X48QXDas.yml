description: "For .NET developers, writing client side C# has always been a pipe dream. With the introduction of Blazor this all changes. Blazor is a .NET web framework that runs in any browser. Blazor uses the latest in web standards, WebAssembly. This means no plugins, transpilation, or JavaScript are needed. In this session we’ll explore what Blazor means for web development and learn about how this experiment at Microsoft is shaping up. Blazor runs in the browser on a real .NET run-time (Mono) implemented in WebAssembly that executes normal .NET assemblies.\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
