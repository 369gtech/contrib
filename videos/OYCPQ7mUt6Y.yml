title: 'DEF CON 29 Voting Village -  Brianna Lennon and Eric Fey - High Turnout, Wide Margins'
language: English
recordingDate: 1632350796
description: "Local election officials faced unprecedented challenges while administering elections in 2020, from widespread disinformation to COVID-19 safety precautions. Unlike in previous election cycles, though, the global pandemic prevented officials from connecting in person to commiserate, share best practices, and support each other. \n\nIn December of 2020, the High Turnout Wide Margins podcast launched to fill the void and give administrators an outlet for discussing the nuts and bolts of elections. Co-hosts Brianna Lennon, an elected county clerk in Boone County, Missouri and Eric Fey, an appointed director of elections in St. Louis County, Missouri, talk to subject-matter experts on topics like cybersecurity, disinformation, and elections integrity. In this presentation, Lennon and Fey share key takeaways from these discussions. \n\nHigh Turnout Wide Margins is not a commercial podcast."
