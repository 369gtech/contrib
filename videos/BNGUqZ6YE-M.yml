title: 'Extremely rapid application development with Apache Isis (Jeroen van der Wal, Netherlands)'
recordingDate: 1406799277
description: "In this talk, you’ll learn about Apache Isis, an open source Java framework for writing line-of-business enterprise web applications, and access them through REST. An application written in Isis will be a fraction the size it would be if you coded it “traditionally”. That’s important… faster time-to-market, cheaper to maintain, as well as a cleaner architecture.\n\nIsis’ focus is on domain-driven design, with the emphasis on the bit that matters: the domain. The productivity and clean architecture comes about by omitting all the irrelevant artifacts of a custom-coded n-layer architecture (views, controllers, commands, persistence); you build your app solely and entirely by writing the core domain objects.\n\nThere’s a pattern for this type of approach: naked objects. Isis automatically provides a webapp UI inferred directly from the structure and behaviour of your domain objects. What’s more, Isis also makes your domain model accessible through REST following the “Restful Objects” specification."
