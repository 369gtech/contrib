description: "As the importance of data science has been widely reported on, companies will continue to have ever expanding appetites for analytic talent. Many individuals who have the job title data scientist have Ph.D.s in quantitative research such as Physics, Computer Science, and Statistics, however, the demand for analytic talent is much larger than industries ability to keep up. This talk addresses the role of immersive programs in filling the skills gap. The discussion will contrast the approach to education that these programs take to traditional postsecondary education, and how tying employment factors are familiar to those versed in machine learning.\n\nMany individuals who have the job title data scientist have Ph.D.s in quantitative research such as Physics, Computer Science, and Statistics, however, the demand for analytic talent is much larger than industries ability to keep up.
