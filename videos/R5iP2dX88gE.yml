recordingDate: 1540976194
description: "In the current cyber landscape several vulnerabilities are discovered every day. The volume of information and multiple sources to consume this information create interesting challenges for any security team. In the recent months several organizations have been prey of bad actors, exposing private data of millions of users, many times from month old vulnerabilities.\n\nVulnerability management is often disregarded, improperly staffed and rarely discuss in the infosec community, yet is one of the single point of failures allowing for breaches to take place. Under this circumstance, are you prepared to deal with vulnerabilities accordingly?\n\nIn this talk, we’ll share our experiences dealing vulnerabilities at scale. What works, what does not and why. More importantly, what actions you should consider improving or build your Vulnerability program. In the process, we’ll introduce some of the custom tools created internally to automate and enhance the program.\n\nUnlike most Vulnerability Management talks, this talk is about the hands-on portion and day-to- day activities that must take place. Whether you are a seasoned infosec professional or new to the field, there is something for you to take away, especially at scale."
