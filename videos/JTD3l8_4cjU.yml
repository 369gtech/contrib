description: "Domain-Driven Design Europe 2018\nhttps://dddeurope.com/\nhttps://twitter.com/ddd_eu\nTurns out Domain-Driven Design works not only for cargo shipping, but for marketing systems as well. In this session I’d like to share the story of Plexop - a large-scale marketing system that spans over a dozen of different business domains: from optimizing advertising spaces, to managing sales agents’ commissions. Plexop had to be implemented with tight resources, and even tighter time to market. That’s why we embraced Domain-Driven Design from day one, and boy did it pay out. I’ll show how DDD allowed us deliver Plexop on time and on budget: what worked, what didn’t, what we had to learn ourselves, and the prices we paid when tried to cut corners.\n\nBIOGRAPHY\n\nHaving over 15 years of experience in the software industry, Vladik has worked across multiple business domains, including advertisement, healthcare, telecommunications, and customer acquisition. Currently Vladik serves as the Chief Architect for Internovus, where he is in charge of large-scale projects, and an international developers team. Vladik’s main areas of interest are Domain-Driven Design, Distributed Systems, Cloud Computing, and building effective teams. When he's not geeking out, Vladik reads lots of books, photographs nature, and repairs his r/c aircrafts."
