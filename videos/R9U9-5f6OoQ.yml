description: "This presentation will challenge a common movement that is sweeping the lands unnoticed. Agile micro-service projects that live in a single VCS repository, that are slow to test, hard to understand need to be deployed and versioned as a single unit. While that sounds silly, ask these questions of your project:\n\nAre you using a layered architecture?\nDo you generally have an interface for each class (Java/.NET)?\nDo your Views live in one folder and your ViewModels in another?\nHas your platform’s package manager made it too easy to just add, more?\nHas your team mistaken “reuse” as a goal, not an outcome?\nDoes your team favor living code over doco, yet no one understands how the system works?\nCould you make a one line code change, test it, commit it, package it and deploy it in under 15min?\nDo you think you are doing Microservices, but all the code lives in the same repo? Share the same contracts? Get versioned and deployed together? Share a data store?\nEven if you are not on the Microservices band wagon, will your framework of choice be relevant in 5 years? Can your team pivot to new libraries, GUI or data store technologies in days or weeks? Or, are you actively building the next legacy project churn-and-burn style?\n\nThis session will pose some challenges to prevailing convention and ask how did we get here. More importantly we will discover the costs of our decisions and how we start applying an engineering instead of religious approach to design.\n\nEngineering lead for Global Poker, author and presenter with extensive experience in concurrent programming, composite applications, web and integration technologies.
