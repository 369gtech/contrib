How to ensure that your program cannot fail ? How to ensure that what you're developing will work as expected without unwanted side-effects ? etc.\n\nSince then, several approaches were developed; one of them is static type analysis, a methodology which tries to prove that your program is correct based on the mathematical types theory, whose basic assumption is that unless your program can prove it attends it's basic contracts, it is faulty.\nConsidering Erlang is widely known by it's focus on fault-tolerance and, by consequence, guarantees of reliability, there have been several attempts to improve Erlang programs by proving their correctness with type systems but such attempts have failed.\n\nThis talk proposes to explain what is a type system, why attempts to type strictly Erlang have failed and how the theory of Session Types might prove to be a way to achieve correctness in environments like Erlang's.\n\nRead the full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/charlotte-lorelei-de-oliveira100/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - CHARLOTTE LORELEI DE OLIVEIRA\nNet Idol âœ¨\n\nCharlotte likes to talk about free open source software, privacy, programming languages, theory and software engineering.\n\nHer work is breaking computers, fixing them and then teaching others about the results.\n\nMore on Charlotte Lorelei de Oliveira: https://codesync.global/speaker/charlotte-lorelei-de-oliveira100/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM STO 19\nCode BEAM STO is powered by Code Sync.
