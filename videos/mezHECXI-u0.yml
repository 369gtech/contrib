We will discuss:\n\nDeveloping and customizing Cloud Foundry while staying in sync with the open source repositories Building custom Cloud Foundry services using Java and Spring Improved gathering application diagnostics by simplifying JMX and remote debugging support in Cloud Foundry Enhanced security and auditability with application level firewalls\n\nCome learn from our successes as well as our mistakes."
