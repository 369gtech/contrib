title: 'John Resig: Measuring Performance, JavaScript Games, and Distributed Testing'
language: English
recordingDate: 1358625983
description: 'John Resig presents his mystery topic, which is actually three topics that strike his interest. First up is measuring performance and a quick introduction to benchmarking (and its positives and negatives). This is followed by JavaScript Games which he unveils some super cool hidden functionality (cheat codes++) on the jQuery web site. This is followed up by the introduction of Johnapos;s distributed continuous test framework platform, Test Swarm. It is jam packed with Nirvana and goodness so be sure to watch both parts.'
