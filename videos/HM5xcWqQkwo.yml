description: "Speaker: Tomas Votruba, Péhápka?i\nBefore composer, we downloaded packages manually. But how do you upgrade to newer framework version? Still manually?\n\nIn non-PHP world, Google and Facebook already use such instant upgrade tools. Thanks to nikic/php-parser a door opened in PHP for such a tool ...and Rector was born.\n\nI’ll show you how Rector handles 80 % of boring upgrades for you - in 1 CLI command.\n\nAbout the speaker\n\nTomas loves PHP and connecting people, so he founded Czech & Slovak PHP Community Pehapkari in 2015, where all PHP developers can share their knowledge, chat on Slack or grab a beer.\n\nHis passion is open-source for lazy people - instant upgrades and coding standards. He takes care of Rector and EasyCodingStandard packages.\n\nEvent Page: https://2018.phpconf.asia\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/lcAb/"
