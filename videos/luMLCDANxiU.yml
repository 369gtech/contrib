recordingDate: 1589559970
description: "Apache Pinot is a distributed columnar database for real-time analytics. It powers many well-known applications, including LinkedInâ€™s Who Viewed My Profile feature and Uber Eats timely analytics. Since Pinot joined Apache Incubator in 2019, it has gained a lot of momentum with a growing community. \n\nDuring this May 2020 Uber Engineering Meetup, software engineer Kishore Gopalakrishna discusses why LinkedIn decided to build Pinot, and how the solution has changed the analytics landscape at LinkedIn, Uber, and other companies."
