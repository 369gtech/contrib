description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nFull Stack Cloud Native Packaging – An Intro to CNAB - Ben Griffin & Clarence Bakirtzidis, Microsoft \n\nCloud Native applications require more than deploying Docker containers. At the very least, we need to configure infrastructure such as databases, load balancers, and networking for our application to run. To further complicate matters the use of heterogenous technologies and tools might be required.\n\nWouldn't it be great if there was a technology that took care of all this for us? Cloud Native Application Bundle (CNAB) address these challenges by securely packaging your artefacts and toolchains required to run your application.\n\nIn this talk we will demystify CNAB by looking at the problems it is trying to solve, diving into the spec and various implementations including Docker App and Porter, and how tools such as Docker Compose or Helm can be incorporated into CNAB. We’ll round out the presentation by applying what we have learnt through a real-world use case."
