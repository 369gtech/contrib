title: 'O''Reilly Webcast:  Part 2 - The Best of Velocity: Mobile Web Application Performance'
recordingDate: 1364849800
description: "Part2\n\nMobile browser performance is challenged by bandwidth, battery, and memory constraints. Slow loading and reacting sites create bad user experiences. Sites that drain batteries or crash the browser are infuriating. Porting a web application designed and developed for desktop devicesâ€”devices with virtually unlimited memory, and literally unlimited power (they're plugged in, not running on battery) in many cases just doesn't work. By understanding mobile limitations and keeping mobile in mind throughout the development process you can create more responsive, faster downloading, less battery consuming applications.\n\nIn this exclusive re-broadcast talk by Estelle Weyl from Velocity 2012 conference, we assume you understand general web performance optimization, and instead focus on best practices required to improve performance on mobile devices. Instead of just covering how best to get a site onto a device, you will learn how to make sure it works optimally once it is there.\n\nTopics include:\n\n    HTML5\n    CSS3\n    Images\n    JavaScript\n    and the DOM\n\nWe'll cover mobile device limitations that often lead to poor user experiences as well as tips and techniques to prevent these trouble spots from arising.\n\nAbout Estelle Weyl\n\nEstelle Weyl started her professional life in architecture, then managed teen health programs. In 2000, she took the natural step of becoming a web standardista. She has consulted for Kodakgallery, Yahoo! and Apple, among others. Estelle shares esoteric tidbits learned while programming CSS, JavaScript and XHTML in her blog at http://evotech.net/blog and provides tutorials and detailed grids of CSS3 and HTML5 browser support in her blog at http://www.standardista.com. She is the co-author of HTML5 and CSS3 for the Real World, Mobile HTML5, What is CSS3 and HTML: The definitive Guide. While not coding, she works in construction, de-hippifying her 1960's throwback abode."
