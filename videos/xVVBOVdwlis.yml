description: "Held on December 13, 2018\n\nIn this session, we show how graph technologies can be combined with machine learning techniques, and applied to real-world use cases, using medical, network security, and financial data. \n\nHighlights:\n00:00 – Welcome, the story so far. Jean briefly recaps previous sessions (graph intro, architecture)\n06:20 – Benefits and main idea of using graphs for data analysis – Sungpack\n09:00 – Approach 1:  Classical method via graph algorithms.  Sungpack shares an example of anomaly detection, using a medicare data set that’s publicly available.  Anomalies in treatments provided by specific doctors are identified, which may indicate fraud.\n23:40 -- Approach 2:  Feeding graph data into a machine learning pipeline by generating features from graph algorithms.  Sungpack walks through a security application example, where the problem is detecting malware in a network.   \n31:05 -- Zeppelin notebook based demo – malware detection\n35:40 -- Approach 3:  Graph embedding techniques (future directions).  Sungpack discusses techniques now in the R&D phase, and possible use cases in life sciences and finance.\n55:20 – Resources, Analytics and Data Summit (March 2019) event announcement,  and wrapup\n\nSlides are available here:\nhttps://www.slideshare.net/JeanIhm/when-graphs-meet-machine-learning\n\nThis is the 6th video in a series.
