description: "Abdullah Khalid Omi asks CodeTap:\n- hi bro\n- i am facing some problem with some css things. i thought you could help me\n- do you know how to wrap content within a circle? i gave you an img you can see the problem.  actually i want to make those text wrapped within the circle.\n\nChallenge accepted.
