description: "by Thomas F Herbert and Billy McFall\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/H.2214/vpp_northbound_connections.webm\n\n\nMany have recognized the advantages of containerization and container platforms for traditional web server and database apps. With the expansion of IoT as well as Telco and service providersâ€™ workloads into containers, there is an increased focus on NFV, and other non-traditional networking intensive applications. These applications require layer two and three access to high performance data planes from within containers and Kubernetes pods. In this session, we will dive into the particular requirements for layer2 and layer3 containerized applications. We will also discuss and compare some solutions such as Network Service Mesh (NSM) and Multus and how they are used for the connection and orchestration of NFV containerized workloads. \n\nRoom: H.2214\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 15:40:00+01"
