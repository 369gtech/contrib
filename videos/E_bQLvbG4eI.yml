For image classification, this typically involves providing hundreds of known photos to a platform to train a model, and then use this model to infer characteristics of new pictures. Supervised learning at its simplest: just show labeled samples, and you get a model.\n\nI will demo several recent tools that help build a model from a collection of pictures and a list of labels, and compare the quality of the results. Each may have its own answer to this fundamental question: Is it easier to detect Wallace or to detect Gromit?\n\nValentin Deleplace \nFrom Google\nValentin is a senior developer for backends, databases, cloud architecture, performance, algorithms, and UX.
