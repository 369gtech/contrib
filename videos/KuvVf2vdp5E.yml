description: "PyData Tel Aviv Meetup #15\n23 July 2018\nSponsored and Hosted by Taboola\nhttps://www.meetup.com/PyData-Tel-Aviv/\n\nA direct and local deep learning (DL) model for atomic forces is presented. We analyze the model’s performance as a function of the number of\nneighbors included and show that one can ascertain physical\nattributes of the system from the analysis of the deep learning model’s behavior. Finally, we test the size scaling performance of the model, and the transferability between different temperatures, and show that our model performs well in both scaling to larger systems and high-to-low temperature predictability.\nBased on : https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01151.pdf\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nFind a PyData chapter near you: meetup.com/pro/pydata"
