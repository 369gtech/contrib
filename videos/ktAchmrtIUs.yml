description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2014.\nSpeaker: Gunnar Hillert\nWeb / JavaScript Track\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/creating-modular-test-driven-spas-with-spring-and-angularjs-41166049\nSingle-page Applications (SPA) are all the rage these days and with them there is an avalanche of new tools, libraries and frameworks we need to know. But what does this mean for us as Spring developers? In this session we will give you an overview of the current landscape and illustrate the choices the Spring XD team has made for its user interface. What do I use to write SPA applications? How do I integrate them into existing Spring-based backends? How do I build them? Can I integrate them into my existing Gradle or Maven build processes in order to achieve complete build automation? How do I integrate realtime messaging using Spring's SockJS/WebSocket support? In this talk we will answer these and many more questions. We will cover frameworks such as AngularJS, Bootstrap, RequireJS; tools like Bower, Grunt, Gulp; and also talk about testing using Karma and Protractor."
