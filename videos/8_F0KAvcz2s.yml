description: "PyData Warsaw 2018\n\nIn the past two years, we’ve seen the industry discovery of speech as a critical interface protocol between humans and machines, especially for cloud-based information queries driving by speech recognition. These create significant new opportunities for every application that touches audio or video - opening up new potential for improved intelligibility, personalisation and customer “stickiness”.\n===\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
