description: "Slides: http://www.quirksmode.org/presentations/Spring2012/mobilebrowserworld_mobilism.pdf\n\nOK, so in mobile there are about 25 browsers, 20 operators, 15 device vendors (excluding the tiny ones), and 10 operating systems. Do you know your way around all of them?\n\nEspecially for people who come from the quiet, reclusive zone that is the desktop web, with only 5 browsers and 3 platforms, the mobile world can be a daunting place where everything happens at once, relations are much more complicated than you expect, and the sheer amount of actors is confusing.\n\nIn this session PPK will attempt to bring some order in the chaos by discussing about seven of the most important actors, their relations, and their long-term plans. After this talk you can amaze your friends by explaining why Windows Phone will never amount to much, why Android fragmentation will become only worse, in which way Apple has stolen a march on its competitors, and what Nokia is doing.\n\nAbout Peter-Paul: https://quirksmode.org\nAbout Mobilism: https://mobilism.nl"
