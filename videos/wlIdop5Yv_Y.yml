recordingDate: 1529943875
description: "In this tutorial, you will learn to take a simple getting started GatsbyJS example and transform it into a Contentful powered website.\n\n💻Code: https://github.com/Khaledgarbaya/gatsby-contentful-site\n\nWhat is Gatsbyjs?\n\nGatsby.js builds the fastest possible website. Instead of waiting to generate pages when requested, pre-build pages and lift them into a global cloud of servers—ready to be delivered instantly to your users wherever they are.\n\nWhat is Contentful?\n\nContentful provides a content infrastructure for digital teams to power content in websites, apps, and devices. Unlike a CMS, Contentful was built to integrate with the modern software stack. It offers a central hub for structured content, powerful management and delivery APIs, and a customizable web app that enable developers and content creators to ship digital products faster.\n\n🔗View more great tutorials from Khaled: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_XsS8kgD9Y64ZOug4YKhpw\n\n🐦Khaled on Twitter: https://twitter.com/khaled_garbaya\n\n🔗Check out https://howtocontentful.com to learn more about Contentful\n\n\n--\n\nLearn to code for free and get a developer job: https://www.freecodecamp.com\n\nRead hundreds of articles on programming: https://medium.freecodecamp.com\n\nAnd subscribe for new videos on technology every day: https://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=freecodecamp"
