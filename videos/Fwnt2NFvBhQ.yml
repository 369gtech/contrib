description: "I'm an introvert. This can be a bit unfortunate, when you are a person that enjoys spending a lot of free time creating fashion things bedazzled with LEDs... only to rarely wear them out in public. In an effort to actually share my weird and wonderful creations with others, I decided to create a wearable project that would force me to be sociable in order for it to reveal its magic. In this talk, I'll share how I am using machine learning with javascript and tiny computers to make \"fashion\" that is responsive to the people around you and the attention you are (or aren't) receiving.\n\nStephanie Nemeth\nMicrosoft\n@stephaniecodes\n\nStephanie is a developer living in Berlin. She enjoys experimenting with hardware and LEDs to make beautiful, useless things."
