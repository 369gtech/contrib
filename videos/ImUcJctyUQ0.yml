description: "This presentation was recorded at Chicago's GOTO Night \nhttp://gotochgo.com\n\nRalph E. Johnson - Research Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois\n\nABSTRACT\nAs Design Patterns reaches its 20th year, its faults are easier to see. We'll look at a few of them and see if we can learn lessons about writing patterns. The talk will focus on Observer, Adapter, and Iterator. If you haven't looked at them for awhile, you might want to refresh your memory before the talk.\n\nVideo Sponsored by CJUG\nhttp://cjug.org\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOchgo\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
