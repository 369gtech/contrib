title: 'Rebecca Bilbro - Thrifty Machine Learning| PyData Global 2020'
language: English

description: "Talk\nWe live with an abundance of ML resources; from open source tools, to GPU workstations, to cloud-hosted autoML. What’s more, the lines between AI research and everyday ML have blurred; you can recreate a state-of-the-art model from arxiv papers at home. But can you afford to? In this talk, we explore ways to recession-proof your ML process without sacrificing on accuracy, explainability, or value.\n\nSpeaker\nRebecca is a machine learning engineer, Python and Go programmer, teacher, speaker, and author in Raleigh, NC. She is an active contributor to the open source community, and the creator of Yellowbrick, an open source Python library that extends scikit-learn models into Visualizers using matplotlib.\n\nShe has been a speaker at PyCon, delivering a 2016 talk about visual diagnostics for machine learning that mapped out the foundations of the Yellowbrick project, and in 2017 on building a custom corpus for natural language processing. She has also given talks at O’Reilly Strata NYC, PyData Carolinas, PyData London, PyData San Luis, and EuroSciPy.\n\nIn addition to her work on Yellowbrick, Rebecca is co-author of the O’Reilly book, Applied Text Analysis with Python and emeritus board member for Data Community DC - a not-for-profit organization that organizes free monthly events and lectures for the local data community in Washington, DC.\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
