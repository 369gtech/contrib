description: 'Engineers like to be interviewed at Grammarly, and many of them say it was the best interview they ever passed. So they ask me to share my interviewer experience. I tried to make that topic interesting not only for DevOps\SRE hiring managers but for every engineer. DevOps\SRE interview will be just an example how you can make your interviewer skills better.'
