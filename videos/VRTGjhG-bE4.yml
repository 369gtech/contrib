The currently available communication architectures, however, make FPGAs very difficult to utilize resources in data center. In this paper, we present Direct Universal Access (DUA), a communication architecture that provides uniform access for FPGA to heterogeneous data center resources. Without considering machine boundaries, DUA provides global names and a common interface for communicating with various resources, where the underlying network automatically routes traffic and manages resource multiplexing. Our benchmarks show that DUA provides simple and fair-share resource access with small logic area overhead (10%) and negligible latency (0.2$\\mu$s). We also build two practical multi-FPGA applications, deep crossing and regular expression matching, on top of DUA to demonstrate the usability and efficiency.\n\nView the full NSDI '19 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi19/technical-sessions"
