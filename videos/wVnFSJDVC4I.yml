description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Oslo 2020. #GOTOcon #GOTOoslo\nhttps://goto-oslo.com\r\n\r\nMark West - Data scientist by day, IoT maker by night and one of GOTO’s highest-rated speakers\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\nData Science has been described as the sexiest job of the 21st Century. But what is Data Science? And what has Machine Learning got to do with all of this?\nIn this talk, Mark will share insights and knowledge that he has gained from building up a Data Science department from scratch. This talk will be split into three sections:\n1. He’ll begin by defining what Data Science is, how it is related to Machine Learning and share some tips for introducing Data Science to your organisation.\n2. Next up we’ll run through some commonly used Machine Learning algorithms used by Data Scientists, along with examples for use cases where these algorithms can be applied.\n3. The final third of the talk will be a demonstration of how you can quickly get started with Data Science and Machine Learning using Python [...]\r\n\r\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\r\nhttps://goto-oslo.com/2020/sessions/1257/a-practical-ish-introduction-to-data-science-virtual\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\r\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\r\n#DataScience #ML #MachineLearning #AI #ArtificialIntelligence\r\n\r\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\r\nAttend the next GOTO Conference near you!
