description: "This video was recorded at Scala Days Berlin 2016\nFollow us on Twitter @ScalaDays or visit our website for more information http://scaladays.org \n\nAnstract:\nWhat does it mean to think like a functional programmer? Why is it so hard to adopt functional programming if you are steeped in OO? In this talk I'll address these questions, using ideas from the philosophy of science. The talk will give new insight into the process of becoming productive in Scala, and the mindset needed to aid this process. \n\nUsing the framework of \"\"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\"\" we can see programming as undergoing three revolutions: structured programming, object-oriented programming, and now, functional programming. Each revolution brings with a new paradigm---basic assumptions and values that make moving across paradigms difficult to achieve. \n\nIn this talk I'll describe the paradigm of the functional programmer: what is valued and, what is considered good code. I will contrast this to the paradigm of the object-oriented programmer, and finally consider if it is possible to reconcile these two approaches to programming."
