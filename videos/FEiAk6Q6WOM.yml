description: "A Bartender's Guide to Network Monitoring\n\nJohn Blaho, Catchpoint\n\nCreating the perfect cocktail is a subjective effort. You may select the finest ingredients, using high performing equipment with a highly trained hand, but judgment falls on the consumer. It is always about the end-user experience. SREs are some of the most skilled professionals of their craft and having knowledge of end-user expectations to assure a good experience.\n\nIn this session, we will measure out the ingredients and prepare the perfect network cocktail with use cases and monitoring examples:\n\n- Lay out the basics: Measure SLOs to ensure ongoing vendor obligations are met.\n- Alcohol base: Monitor DNS & BGP for consistent reachability.\n- Fresh ingredients: Assure CDN performance doesn't affect the service.\n- Mix and Serve: Take the outside-in approach to optimize the customer experience.\n\nView the full SREcon20 Americas program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon20americas/program"
