title: 'GeeCON 2018: Miro Cupak - Clean code with Java 9'
recordingDate: 1532331015
description: 'One of the most talked about features of the latest release of Java is arguably JShell, Java’s Read-Eval-Print-Loop implementation. However, there is a whole set of smaller features allowing developers to produce cleaner code faster. In this session, we''ll use JShell to demonstrate how Java 9 allows us to write cleaner code by exploring features like factory methods for collections, extended streams, updates to Optional, try with effectively final resources, private methods, process management API, stackwalker, and more.'
