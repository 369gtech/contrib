Yet, the tools most people are using with their data requires a huge amount of experience to understand and scale. We are also facing a time where it is necessary to track the flow of data for better understanding and compliance with GDPR.  I am going to walk through how to take advantage of Kuberentes and other Cloud Native technologies with the open source project Pachyderm to create data science pipelines that are easy to develop, test, deploy and scale. I will also cover how to use Data Versioning throughout the process to track data changes and understand exactly how your data is changing.  Talk Outline:  1. Introduce the basic concepts of Data Pipelines and Versioning.  2. Create and test a simple model.  4. Scale it up to a production sized workload and automatically have changes deployed in the pipeline. \n\nTo learn more click here: https://sched.co/FuJu"
