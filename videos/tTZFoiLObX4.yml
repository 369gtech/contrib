Windows container technology is new and the kernel is quite different from Linux. Running Windows applications natively in a Kubernetes Windows container cluster is very challenging especially in the network area.  In this presentation, Cindy and Dinesh will do a deep dive into the Windows container network technology. They will compare Windows container network mechanisms with Linux ones and make visual analogies. Using a real world case study, a sample implementation of a Kubernetes Windows CNI plugin along with network troubleshooting tips will also be walked through.  \n\nTo learn more click here:  https://sched.co/FuKI"
