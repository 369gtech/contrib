description: "For front-end devs, the deployment platform is a browser, yet few know what is going on under the hood and how browsers work. This talk aims to de-mystify and explore the browser as a platform.\n\nIt will be an exploration of browser internals, covering items such as how JS is run in the browser, how painting works, exactly how many threads are running, how the Event Loop & Call Stacks work, animation frames and an exploration of lesser known tools and APIs.\n\nFITC produces events for digital creators in Toronto, Amsterdam, NYC and beyond\nSave 10% off any of our events with discount code 'youtube'\n\nCheck out our events at http://fitc.ca\nor follow us at https://twitter.com/fitc"
