language: English
recordingDate: 1543722703
description: 'WeedAnon is a long time infosec practitioner, cannabis enthusiast, and active volunteer with the HackMiami Conference of South Florida. WeedAnon believes that cannabis use is a great way to pass the time while awaiting internet wide port scans to complete, and sees the emerging cannabis industry as an under-served marketplace when it comes to the implementation of information security best practices. This talk will discuss the emerging attack surface of the cannabis industry. Analysis of physical, digital, and compliance risks that go hand-in-hand with newly drafted medical and recreational legislation will be examined. Examples of discussion points include topics such as the secure management of PII, various compliance requirements, secure data storage, interaction with regulatory authorities, physical security issues, IoT security, legal loopholes and ambiguities, as well as suggestions for best practices and resources for followup research.'
