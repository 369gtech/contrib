description: "Join us for #RenderConf 2018: https://goo.gl/iXs1mJ\n\nSlides: http://bit.ly/render2017slides\n\nReact is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces that has taken the web development industry by storm. Its declarative syntax and DOM abstraction for components not only make client-side development simple, but also enables server-side rendering of those same components, which enables improved SEO and initial browser load time. But how do you render JavaScript React components server-side if your backend doesn’t run on Node? Learn how Eventbrite successfully integrated React with their Python/Django backend so that you can do the same in yours.\n\nABOUT BEN ILEGBODU\n\nBen is a Christian, a husband and a father of 2 with 10+ years of experience developing user interfaces for the Web. He currently leads and manages Eventbrite’s Frontend Platform team. On the side, Ben also enjoys playing basketball, DIY, watching movies, and blogging (benmvp.com) / tweeting (@benmvp) about his experiences with new web technologies."
