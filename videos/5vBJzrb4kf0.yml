description: "Achieving Pragmatic Parity for Windows Containers - Sophie Wigmore & Matt Horan, Pivotal \n\nThe Garden Windows team has been working hard to give Windows workloads “pragmatic parity” with their Linux counterparts. That work includes enabling custom certificate authority injection, ensuring graceful process termination, maintaining route integrity using TLS, and securing container-to-container networking. In this project update, Yael and Genevieve will cover these new features with a demonstration of configuring and enabling custom certificate authorities for Windows containers in a Cloud Foundry deployment, an implementation review of the graceful shutdown process that provides workloads time to shutdown cleanly, and an update on the status of running Istio and Envoy on Windows. \n\nFor more info: https://www.cloudfoundry.org/"
