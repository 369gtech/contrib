description: "This talk will show how it's possible to mock PerlOps using XS and provide a convenient Pure Perl hook for each of the file check -X.\n\nOverload::FileCheck provides a way to mock one or more file checks. It is also possible to mock stat/lstat functions using \"mock_all_from_stat\" and let Overload::FileCheck mock for you for any other -X checks.\n\nSlides:\nhttps://www.slideshare.net/NicolasRochelemagne/overloading-perl-ops-using-xs"
