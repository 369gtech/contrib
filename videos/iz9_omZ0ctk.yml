From CRDs to admission controllers to custom schedulers, as a platform builder you have access to a powerful toolbox! But what about the humble Pod and its hardworking containers? What if you want to extend them? What tools are at your disposal?  In this talk you’ll learn how to extend a container by overriding its binary. This inventive approach is used by Prow (the CI/CD system that tests Kubernetes itself) and systems built on Tekton Pipelines (a Kubernetes based CI/CD platform) like Jenkins X and OpenShift Pipelines.  You’ll see how you can control the order of container execution within a Pod, stream logs to a persistent store at scale, and gracefully handle the appearance and lifecycle of injected sidecars. You’ll learn some of the benefits and drawbacks, as well as how to overcome the hurdles. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Uaco"
