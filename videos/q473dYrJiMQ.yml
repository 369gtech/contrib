description: "Successfully Onboarding a Junior Engineer in Three Steps by Emily Giurleo\n\nHow you onboard someone to your team can have lasting effects on their professional success, growth, and happiness, but many teams treat onboarding as an afterthought. In this talk, you will learn how to successfully onboard a junior engineer in three steps, with the goals of building their trust, instilling confidence in their technical abilities, and enabling them to be an autonomous contributor to your team.\n\n__________\n\nEmily Giurleo is a software engineer and avid Rubyist. After graduating from MIT with a degree in computer science, she spent two years working as a Ruby developer at Codecademy. She now works at MongoDB, where she helps maintain the Ruby Driver and Mongoid Object-Document Mapper. In her spare time, she enjoys building tech for good causes, reading fantasy novels, and petting cats."
