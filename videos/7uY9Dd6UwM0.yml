description: "Code Coverage on JVM: Practice and Mechanics\nLet's have a look on how to do code coverage measurement on JVM, both from a user point of view and from inside by diving into implementation details of one of the most popular code coverage tools for Java and Kotlin - JaCoCo.\nDynamic Constants - oxymoron or promising JVM feature?\nNew JVM features now arrive with each JDK release. If you are interested to learn and try these new features and wanna know-how in case of problems investigate and report JVM crashes, then come to listen about its new feature introduced in Java 11 - Constant Dynamic. During this talk, we'll see what actually means dynamic constant and why it is such a powerful addition to JVM. We'll also see how little holes in implementation were causing JVM crash in OpenJ9 and OpenJDK 11-14, and how by developing JaCoCo we find and report such bugs - you also can!\nEvgeny Mandrikov - Evgeny is a contributor to various open source projects, including OpenJDK, and a speaker at international conferences and JUGs. He is also one of the project leads of widely adopted code coverage library for Java - JaCoCo, and the award-winning EclEmma project at the Eclipse Foundation that integrates JaCoCo into Eclipse. In his day job at SonarSource Evgeny develops SonarQubeâ€™s static source code analysis for languages such as Java, C/C++, C#, JavaScript."
