We cover:\n— Practical tips on how to position yourself successfully within your organisation and your team for career growth – identify career opportunities open to growth from dead end job roles.\n— The unique challenges of managing a group of creatives within an engineering or business environment. How to inspire cool, sensitive designers in the morning and navigate ruthless number crunching budget setting politics in the afternoon.\n— How to find out if you will genuinely enjoy management – a sneak peek behind the lustre of prestige into the challenges and frustrations of UX leadership.\n\nThis talk is part of The UX Conference organised by The School of UX in London on June 13th 2017.
