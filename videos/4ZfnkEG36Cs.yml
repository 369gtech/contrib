description: "Video from Devoxx Poland 2019.\n\nDo you practice TDD? What about BDD? What about H (Hypothesis) DD?\n\nDid you know that SDD (Stackoverflow Driven Development) is a thing? What about Fowler Driven Development or Marketing Driven Development?\n\nI spent some time working with some colleagues on the A to Z of *DD. The result was a full alphabet of things that at least one of us had experienced during our careers. Some serious, some less so, some good, some undeniably indifferent to bad to plain stupid.\n\nBut out of all of this I wondered what should REALLY drive our development? In this lightning trip around the alphabet of absurdity I will tell you the one guiding principal that we should all stick to when deciding what should drive our development."
