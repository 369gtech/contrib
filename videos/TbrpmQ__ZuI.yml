title: '[Online Meetup] Working with NoSQL in a SQL Database (XDevApi) - Lior Altarescu'
recordingDate: 1589729413
description: "The X Dev API is a new protocol for non-blocking, asynchronous calls to MySQL. In this talk, Lior explores the benefits of working with this protocol and connectors, and the challenges we encountered during the process of adopting X Dev API in Wix Engineering.\n\nWe will share how we are incorporating the protocol in our massive multi dc architecture, and how it helps us, at Wix Engineering, rollout to production faster.\n\nBio:\nLior Altarescu has 7 years of experience in working with Mongo, Oracle, Postgres, SQL server and system/DevOps. He was a team leader in the IAF DBA team, where he helped develop, design, and manage critical systems.\n\nToday he works at Wix Engineering, as a DBA developer, maintaining and building a system that includes +1,000 instances of MySQL, MongoDB and ElasticSearch across more than 5 global locations."
