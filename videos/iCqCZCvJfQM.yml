description: "The 11th ACM Symposium on Document Engineering\r\nMountain View, California, USA\r\nSeptember 19-22, 2011\r\n\r\nComponent-based Hypervideo Model: High-level Operational Specification of Hypervideos\r\nMadjid Sadallah, Olivier Aubert, Yannick Prié\r\nPresented by Madjid Sadallah.\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nHypervideo oers enhanced video-centric experiences. Usually dened from a hypermedia perspective, the lack of a dedicated specication hampers hypervideo domain and concepts from being broadly investigated. This article proposes a specialized hypervideo model that addresses hypervideo specicities. Following the principles of component-based modeling and annotation-driven content abstracting, the Component-based Hypervideo Model (CHM) that we propose is a high level representation of hypervideos that intends to provide a general and dedicated hypervideo data model. Considered as a video-centric interactive document, the CHM hypervideo presentation and interaction features are expressed through a high level operational specication. Our annotation-driven approach promotes a clear separation of data from video content and document visualizations. The model serves as a basis for a Web-oriented implementation that provides a declarative syntax and accompanying tools for hypervideo document design in a Web standards compliant manner."
