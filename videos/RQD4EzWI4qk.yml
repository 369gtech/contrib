description: "Google Tech Talk\r\nOctober 22, 2009\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nPresented by Simon Stewart, Google & Jason Huggins, Sauce Labs, at the 4th Annual Google Test Automation Conference, October 21st, 22nd, 2009, Zurich, CH \r\n\r\nAs astute attendees of previous GTACs have observed, there's a lot in common between Selenium and WebDriver. They're both fantastic tools for automated testing of web apps, but they do their thing in radically different ways. As keen followers of the projects, you may have heard of the plan to merge these projects. What does this mean? And, perhaps more importantly, why should you care? We'll explain how Selenium and WebDriver work, then look to the future and explain what Selenium 2.0 will be. We'll tell you what we plan to do, how we plan to do it. We'll do this by taking a Selenium1.0 script and migrate it into the future of 2.0. Wish us luck!\r\n\r\nBios: Simon Stewart lives in London and works as a Software Engineer in Test at Google. Simon has previously worked at ThoughtWorks, specialising in Agile and Test Driven Development. His Open Source contributions now largely centre on WebDriver, the browser automation project now in the process of merging into Selenium, which he is the technical lead for. It has been said before that Simon enjoys writing better software and beer, sometimes at the same time. This is still true.\r\n\r\nJason Huggins cofounded and leads product direction at Sauce Labs, which offers cloud-based commercial support for Selenium. Before SauceLabs, as a Test Engineer at Google, Jason supported the grid-scale \"Selenium Farm\" for testing Google applications, such as Gmail and Google Docs. Before Google, Jason was a software developer at ThoughtWorks in Chicago. There he created the Selenium testing framework out of the desperation to cross-browser test a new in-house time and expense system.\r\nJason works and lives in Chicago, Illinois, USA. Besides enjoying programming with Python, JavaScript he likes to hack on Arduino-basedelectronics projects."
