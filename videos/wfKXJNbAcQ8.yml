description: "Presented by Ivan Frade, Minh Thai, Software Engineers, Google\n\n\"Google runs a Git hosting service that handles 100s of thousands of repositories of all shapes and sizes. We host Android, which contains huge binary assets and employs  over 1000 distinct repositories, and Chromium, a monorepo with more than 1750 unique committers last year. Both projects see high volumes of code review traffic and employ significant automation (build bots, auto mergers). We see bursts of greater than 20 updates/second in individual repositories, and a bug fix in one branch can trigger a cascade of automated updates to other branches and repositories.\n\nThis talk will provide tales from the trenches of seeing Git stretched to new limits, the work that has motivated, and how Google monitors its hosting service to ensure Git can continue to scale.\"\n\nAbout GitMerge\nGit Merge is the pre-eminent Git-focused conference: a full-day offering technical content and user case studies, plus a day of workshops for Git users of all levels. Git Merge is dedicated to amplifying new voices in the Git community and to showcasing the most thought-provoking projects from contributors, maintainers and community managers around the world.
