description: 'If it takes minutes to code a simple bot, building professional bots represents quite a challenge. Soon you realize you need serious programming and API architecture experience but also “Bot” specific skills. In this session, we''ll first show the code of advanced Chat and Voice interactions, and then explore the challenges faced when building advanced Bots (Context storage, NLP approaches, Bot Metadata, OAuth scopes), and discuss interesting opportunities from latest industry trends (Bot platforms, Serverless, Microservices). This talk is about showing the code and sharing lessons learnt.'
