description: "Sarah Levins\n\nhttps://2020.pycon.org.au/program/E9AXJE\n\nChatbots have become commonplace in our lives. These days, you may find they are largely used as a form of customer service. But how does it make us feel when we know we’re talking to a program? A poor interaction can sour the user’s experience and put them off using a product.\r\n\r\nThere is an art to making programmed responses feel natural. It’s not just about replying to our questions with the correct answer. Chatbots need to be programmed with the same abilities humans have to communicate. They need to be able to listen, understand and remember. This gives them the context of the conversation. So where do you start?\r\n\r\nIn this talk i’ll cover some of the core concepts behind how web chatbots work, strategies used to train them to feel more human, and some Python tools that you can use to start building your own.\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, PyConline\n\nSat Sep  5 11:00:00 2020 at Floperator"
