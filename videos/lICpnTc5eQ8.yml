description: "TDD is a great way to grow your software, but it has some upfront costs, such as test harnesses, test utilities, matchers, and more. These initial costs diminish over time, leaving us with increased TDD velocity. However, there is one that keeps growing: build time. \n\nAs your system grows, and dependencies and integrations are added, testing becomes slower and less reliable, and when this is left unattended, it can be a serious drag on your project. \n\nIn this short talk, we will discuss best practices and strategies for testing large scale projects, and how to avoid build time expansion."
