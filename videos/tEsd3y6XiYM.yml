description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nSponsored Session: StackRox - KubeLinter: an open source tool to create production-ready Kubernetes YAMLs \n\nIf you’ve spent time deploying Kubernetes applications, you know it can be pretty arduous to configure them -- there are so many different objects, so many knobs and dials, so many cross-references to keep track of. Further, in most cases, defaults are geared towards making it easy for users to get their apps up-and-running quickly, and not for secure, production-ready configurations. In this talk, I will introduce KubeLinter, an open-source tool, that solves these problems by linting Kubernetes YAML files and Helm charts to ensure they follow best practices. I will do a hands-on demo of the tool, showing its use on a developer laptop as well as in a CI system. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ff1j"
