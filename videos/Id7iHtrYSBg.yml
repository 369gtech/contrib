description: "Ash will be discussing his goals as a creative person.  How he dreams big and puts forth optimism, hard work, and focus to obtain his goals.  He will break down how he started to teach himself how to draw.  This manifested into his project Lost Boy and he will describe in detail how it has become a life long dream come true.  Ash will break down his daily habits and self-reflections to help others see that it’s a daily process and dreams become a reality if you will them in to existence.\n\nAsh Thorp\nDirector, Designer, Illustrator, Ashthorp.com\nhttps://twitter.com/Ashthorp\nhttp://instagram.com/ashthorp\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
