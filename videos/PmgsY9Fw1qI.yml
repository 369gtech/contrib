description: "My team recently spent some time working on the Gilded Rose kata. This is a small toy problem that allows you to practice your coding skills on a legacy system, but in a safe way. In the process of solving this problem, we learnt a lot and uncovered some great techniques for testing: Approval Tests, stubs and mocks, property testing, and much more. In this talk Iâ€™ll share our experiences, and let you know how you can try out these exercises yourself.\n\n-------\nBarney is a Software Team Lead at Canon Medical in Edinburgh. He has been writing C++ professionally for 25 years. He is really passionate about software crafting, testing and continuous learning.\n-------\n\nC++ on Sea is an annual c++ and coding conference, usually held in Folkestone, Kent in the UK. The 2020 conference was moved to a virtual event due to social distancing requirements.\n\nProduced and Edited by Digital Medium Ltd: https://events.digital-medium.co.uk\nEnquiries: events@digital-medium.co.uk"
