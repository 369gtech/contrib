description: "The world of software development has changed so much and in so many ways since 1968 that it's difficult to imagine what we could learn from then, but it's learning rather than imagination that's the constraint. There was no shortage of imagination, insight and inspiration in the 1960s and 1970s, and in many ways the apple of 21st-century software development has fallen disappointingly close to the tree of the past.\n\nThis video was recorded at SCLConf 2018, an annual conference for software professionals that care about their craft.
