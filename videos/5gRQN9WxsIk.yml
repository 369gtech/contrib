description: "Container technology is booming, but tools to run containers in production have not kept pace – until now. Join Portworx CTO Gou Rao as he shows you how to address the five most common problems DevOps faces when running containerized apps in production. You’ll learn how to:\n\n-Get volume persistence so you don’t lose data when containers fail\n-Achieve high availability with smart provisioning, replication, and failover \n-Automate data management with the most popular container schedulers\n-Run applications using cloud-native deployment patterns\n-Deploy any containerized app with any scheduler on any infrastructure"
