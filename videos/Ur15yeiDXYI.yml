description: "Don't forget to check out our links below!\nhttps://ndcporto.com/\nhttps://ndcconferences.com/\n\nSo you went from a monolith to microservices, and now you need to figure out how you are going to consume the new microservices you have built. Whilst the distribution in microservice architectures provide many benefits to team agility, you rapidly stumble int the question of how we now ‘join’ your distributed data from your different microservices back together to use it.\n\nIn this talk we will look at how we consume services. Where do we do composition, on the client or the server? What are choreography? What are conversations. What is a Gateway, and when do you need one? What is the BFF pattern? How can a Composite View Model help you? How do you implement the reservation pattern and process managers?\n\nWe will also cover handling reliability concerns and why they often naturally fall into conversations about service consumer patterns."
