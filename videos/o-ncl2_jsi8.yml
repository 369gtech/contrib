title: 'Distributed storage is easier now: usability from Ceph Luminous to Nautilus'
recordingDate: 1548118836
description: "Tim Serong\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/206/\n\nDistributed storage is *still* complicated, but the Ceph project has put significant effort into making life easier for administrators and users over the past year.\r\n\r\nFollowing on from Sage Weil's LCA 2018 presentation \"Making distributed storage easy: usability in Ceph Luminous and beyond\", this talk covers the changes we have made in the meantime, including major enhancements to the in-tree Ceph dashboard, centralised configuration management, placement group merging, and the beginnings of a new orchestrator module to tie in with Kubernetes, Salt and Ansible.\r\n\r\nThe Ceph Mimic release in June 2018 includes much of the above work, but we still have plenty more to do for the upcoming Ceph Nautilus release and beyond.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
