title: 'Walt Mankowski - "A Punch Card Ate My Program"'
language: English
recordingDate: 1529421130
description: "COBOL is the Rodney Dangerfield of programming languages — it doesn’t get any respect. COBOL is routinely denigrated for its verbosity and dismissed as archaic, and for good reason: COBOL bears little to no resemblance to modern programming languages. Yet COBOL is far from a dead language. It processes an estimated 85% of all business transactions, and 5 billion lines of new COBOL code are written every year!\n\nAt a past YAPC I argued that COBOL isn’t such a bad language. This year it’s time for an opposing point of view. We’ll journey deep into the past to recreate a retro bug that could only happen in COBOL! Our travels will include:\n\nsyntactic white space!\nscotch tape!\ndueling compiler options!\nvirtual punch cards!\nsentences!\ncode blocks!\nperiods!\n\nNo punch cards were harmed in the creation of this talk."
