title: 'Antifragility or taming the hydra | Katja Obring | CukenFest London 2019'

description: "This talk took place at CukenFest London 2019, our annual conference for BDD enthusiasts. More info here - http://cukenfest.cucumber.io\n\nThe name Nassim Taleb has come to be associated with the crash of financial markets, as he's predicted aptly what happened in the banking crisis of 2008 in his book \"\"The Black Swan\"\". Following from that work, \"\"Antifragility\"\" explores how trying to predict the future leaves us missing the opportunity to withstand disaster by preparing for recovery instead of trying to predict and avert the inevitable crisis. \n\nMy talk examines the concept of antifragility as part of the software development process, and how that can be applied to an agile work environment. It aims to straddle the border between development reality and a broader view on how process can be made resilient, and how we can use a philosophical approach to guide our decisions in day to day software development. \n\nThis talk offers a new perspective on many of the problems we encounter every day in software development, and I hope to illustrate that sometimes a change of perspective can point in the right direction for building resilient, lean software applications."
