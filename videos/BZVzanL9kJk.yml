title: 'Faster Java EE Builds with Gradle'
language: English
recordingDate: 1474472128
description: 'It is time to move your Java EE builds over to Gradle! Gradle continues to gain momentum across the industry. In fact, Google is now pushing Gradle for Android development. Gradle draws on lessons learned from both Ant and Maven and is the next evolutionary step in Java build tools. This session covers the basics of switching existing Java EE projects (that use Maven) over to Gradle and the benefits you will reap, such as incremental compiling, custom distributions, and task parallelization. You’ll see demos of all the goodies you’ve come to expect, such as integration testing and leveraging of Docker. Switching is easier than you think, and no refactoring is required.'
