description: "Video from Devoxx Poland 2019.\n\nGraalVM is a virtual machine that can run many languages on top of the Java Virtual Machine. It comes with support for JavaScript, Ruby, Python... And you can even run your own language!\n\nIn this session we'll discover what it takes to run another language in GraalVM. Using GraalVM, we don't only get a fast runtime, but we'll also get great tooling support. With Brainfuck as an example, we'll see how we can run guest languages inside Java applications. It might not bring us profit, but at least it will bring some fun."
