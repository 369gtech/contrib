title: 'Mmmm… Clean code with Google Guava'
recordingDate: 1431287151
description: 'The Guava project contains several of Google’s core libraries that we rely on in our Java-based projects: collections, caching, primitives support, concurrency libraries, common annotations, string processing, I/O, and so forth. There will be the slides presenting most useful and interesting features of Guava (v.12) that makes stuff simpler, better and code cleaner. We will cover most of the com.google.common.base.* classes and basic use of functions in collection and Google collections and few other features that are part of Guava and I find them very useful. Some of you will think that there is an overlap with Apache commons – and it’s true, but Guava is built with expectation that there is a Function and a Predicate class as well as various builders which makes it really cool and simple for many use cases.'
