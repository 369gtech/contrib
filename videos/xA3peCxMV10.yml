language: English
recordingDate: 1638822104
description: "Maintaining quality over time is often a challenge for most codebases. Technology evolves, deadlines have to be met and sometimes honest mistakes just happen. But what if there were solutions to keep programmers honest and also automate some of the maintenance tasks?\nTooling offers a range of options to automate both menial and complex codebase maintenance tasks. It can also be used to ensure quality standards are met in future developments.\n\nJoin me for a discussion about quality, technical debt, automation and of course a tour of the various tools available to C++ developers that help improve and maintain quality standards.\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).
