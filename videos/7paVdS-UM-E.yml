description: "Stretch Leadership Meetup is Stretch Conference's (stretchcon.com) free online meetup series, where we bring you great leaders to learn from them and get inspired by their stories.\n\nIn this session, Bal치zs goes through the anti-patterns of measuring team performance, evaluates certain metrics and sees how we can combine practices to minimize the distortion effect of Goodhart's law and maximize learning for the team.\n\nBal치zs is an agile coach supporting agile transformations on both small and large scale. In the past 10 years he was supporting agile teams mainly as a scrum master. He is now also mentoring scrum masters, agile coaches and product owners."
