description: "Deep Dive: Cluster Lifecycle SIG (Kubeadm) - Fabrizio Pandini & Lubomir I. Ivanov, VMware \n\nThe Cluster Lifecycle SIG is the Special Interest Group that is responsible for building the user experience for deploying Kubernetes clusters. Our objective is to simplify creation, configuration, upgrade, downgrade, and teardown of Kubernetes clusters and their components.  In this deep dive, we will take a look at recent changes in kubeadm, examine how kubeadm is going to implement support for high availability clusters, and finally peek through the window to see what will come next.  Weâ€™ll reserve time to talk about how to get involved with SIG Cluster Lifecycle and kubeadm, for your questions, concerns, and feature requests!   \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPj5"
