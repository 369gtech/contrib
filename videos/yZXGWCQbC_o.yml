A pattern is not specific to a domain such\nas text processing or graph analysis, but it is a general approach to solving a problem.Using design patterns is all about using tried and true design principles to \nbuild better software.\n\nVideo gives a brief insight of following topics:\n\n1.Understand Binning Pattern\n\n2.Intro to Partitioning Pattern\n\n3.Understand constraints and design paradigm Mapreduce\n\n4.Understand Summarization Patterns\n\n\nRelated Blog : \nhttp://www.edureka.co/blog/tailored-big-data-solutions-using-mapreduce-design-patterns?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=webinar&utm_campaign=mapreduce-binning-tut\n\n\nEdureka is a New Age e-learning platform that provides Instructor-Led Live, Online classes for learners who would\nprefer a hassle free and self paced learning environment, accessible from any part of the world.\n\nThe topics related to Summarization Design Patterns have extensively been covered in our course 'MapReduce Design Patternsâ€™.\nFor more information, please write back to us at sales@edureka.co\nCall us at US: 1800 275 9730 (toll free) or India: +91-8880862004"
