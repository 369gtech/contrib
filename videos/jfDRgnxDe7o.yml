description: "http://www.Cppcon.org\n—\nFutures from Scratch: A Guided Tour of Concurrency in C++14 and Beyond\n--\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2015\n—\nThe contents of header are probably still a bit mysterious to most people. Sure, we know that setting the value of a promise causes the corresponding future to resolve; but how does that happen behind the scenes in a way that allows us to move futures around? How are we going to implement the new features in the Concurrency TS, such as .then() and .when_all()? How (if at all) do futures interact with std::thread, std::async, and \"executors\"?\n\nWe'll present an extremely simplified implementation of futures and shared_futures, without the template metaprogramming that comes along with future and future and so on, but showing all the pointers and synchronization primitives.\n— \nArthur O'Dwyer worked for many years at Green Hills Software, making the world's most optimizing C and C++ compilers. Now he works at Mixpanel in San Francisco, where he organizes a monthly C++ meetup.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
