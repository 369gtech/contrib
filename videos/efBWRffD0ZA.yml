description: "Everyone knows the importance of software security, but does everyone know how to build a secure application? This tutorial provides best practices for building secure applications with Java EE. It presents the fundamentals of secure software development along with the most prominent security vulnerabilities according to The Open Web Application Security Project Foundation (the OWASP Top 10). In a live demo, you’ll learn how to exploit common security vulnerabilities in session management, authentication and authorization, unvalidated input, and various types of injections. You’ll also find out about common mistakes and omissions, Java EE mechanisms, and best practices for implementing secure applications.\n\n\nAuthor:\nPatrycja Wegrzynowicz\nPatrycja Wegrzynowicz is the Head of Software R&D Department at NASK, Research and Academic Computer Network.
