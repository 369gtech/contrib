description: "In this special edition of APEX Office Hours, we will be joined by Vincent Morneau from Insum Solutions.  Vincent will present some of the work done for for the award-winning fabe (For All A Beautiful Earth).\n\nfabe is an all-volunteer project to provide an app to people concerned about the climate change and wanting to take action in their own lives to make a difference. Powered by APEX, fabe borrows several PWA features to make it more appealing to a mobile market. Mixing APEX and PWA have presented some unique challenges, most of which we've overcome. In this session, Vincent will review fabe innovations for APEX including:\n\n- Putting an APEX app in the Google Play Store\n- Allowing the APEX app to install natively into a mobile device\n- Designing for a native mobile look and feel\n- Sending push notifications\n- Having users permanently logged-in\n- Offering unique navigation patterns\n- Presenting a fast, content-heavy experience\n\nAskTOM Office Hours offers free, monthly training and tips on how to make the most of Oracle Database, from Oracle product managers, developers and evangelists.\n\nhttps://asktom.oracle.com/\n\nOracle Developers portal: https://developer.oracle.com/\nSign up for an Oracle Cloud trial: https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/tryit"
