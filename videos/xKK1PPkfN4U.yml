description: "Chromebooks and network motes to enforce security posture from the device to the cloud. Telling a developer they cannot have admin access on their local machine is not practical. We want them to get work done. For any company that doesn’t have an IT security team greater than 4 to 5 people, monitoring devices is not practical. How do we both provide secure access to production where the stakes are very high, and provide admin rights on personal devices? Our solution was to roll out chrome books, and it was fraught with technical challenges.\n\n\nSpeakers\n\nJon Debonis\nHead of Security / CSO, Blend\nHi. I'm Jon. I study companies who've kept huge amounts of data secure, and try to replicate their success.\n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
