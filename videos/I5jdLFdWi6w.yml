title: 'Camel microservices with Spring Boot and Kubernetes (Claus Ibsen, Denmark)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1528194320
description: "Apache Camel has fundamentally changed the way enterprise Java developers think about system-to-system integration by making enterprise integration patterns (EIP) a simple declaration in a lightweight application wrapped and delivered as a single JAR.\n\nIn this session, we’ll show you how to bring the best practices from the EIP world together with containers, running on top of Kubernetes, and deployed as Spring Boot microservices, which are both cloud-native and cloud-portable.\n\nBuilding and designing cloud-native microservices impacts how we develop. We’ll discuss practices how to build distributed and fault-tolerant microservices with technologies such as Kubernetes Services, Netflix Hystrix, Camel EIP patterns, and Istio. You will see live demos of us killing containers to test fault tolerance, and more.\n\nThis talk is 2/3th slides and 1/3th demos."
