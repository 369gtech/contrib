description: "Find more informatin here: https://berlinbuzzwords.de/session/apache-lucene-6-whats-coming-next\n\nAt the beginning of the year 2016, the Apache Lucene team decided to focus on releasing Apache Lucene 6. Around Berlin Buzzwords, the new version will be available for testing.\n\nThis talk will present the new features that Lucene 6 will bring: A new data type called \"points\" (also known as dimensional values) and corresponding queries as faster, multidimensional replacement for NumericRangeQuery. It will also completely remove the concept of \"filters\" in favour of non-scoring queries. Last but not least, Lucene and Solr 6 will require Java 8 as minimum requirement.\n\nThis talk will also present the many new features in Apache Solr 6: It now understands an SQL dialect to do queries and aggregations. In combination with a brand new JDBC driver, one can query Solr using standard database tools."
