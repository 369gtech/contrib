description: "Damian Conway. Three Little Words\nThe Perl Conference in Amsterdam\n9 August 2017\n\nAll I wanted was to add three extra words to Perl's standard syntax.\nHow hard could that be?\n\nIn the end, it required:\n\n• three years,\n• 2.8 million lines of code,\n• five nested development projects,\n• 3633 CPAN modules,\n• 498405 unit tests,\n• the five most perfectly obfuscated Perl programs of all time,\n• multiple multi-layered multiple-dispatch systems,\n• a 1011-line substitution statement,\n• a 1196-line regex match,\n• an entirely new meta-meta-meta-syntax.\n\nThis is a tale of madness, obsession, and coding extremity.\nThis is a journey to the very heart of Perl...and beyond.\nThis is, very possibly, the most practically useful set of modules I have ever written.\n\nWhat could possibly go wrong? \n\nhttp://act.perlconference.org/tpc-2017-amsterdam/talk/7149"
