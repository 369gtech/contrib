description: "Google Tech Talk (more info below)\r\nMarch 7, 2011\r\n\r\nPresented by Ilya Grigorik.\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nThe social web connects people where they share, critique and interact with content and each other. PostRank is the largest aggregator of social engagement data in the industry. Our platform tracks where and how users engage, and what they pay attention to - in real-time. In this talk we'll take a look at the applications of the technology: enhancing discovery, web search, analytics for the social web, and benchmarking / competitive intelligence. After that, we'll take a look under the covers at how we've architected our system, the technical challenges we've solved, and the challenges in front of us.\r\n \r\nIlya Grigorik is the founder and CTO of PostRank, a real-time social engagement monitoring and analytics platform. He is an avid Ruby blogger (igvita.com, Twitter: @igrigorik), speaker, and a community evangelist."
