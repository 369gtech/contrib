description: 'One of the hottest tools for log monitoring and analytics at the moment is the ELK stack: * Elasticsearch doing the hard work of searching large amounts of data. * Logstash for ingesting logs. * Kibana for visualizing what is going on. This talk gives you an overview of the three technologies, how they are working together, and how they can solve your problems.'
