description: "One day, you wake up and you want to make (web)maps. Alas, this path can sometimes be a tortuous one.\nThis talk describes this journey and the endless discoveries I made as a front-end developer.\nWhether you simply want to add some map to your app, or whether you are already obsessed with them, let me show you a few tricks that I picked up along the road - avoiding a few headaches in the way.\nI will talk about the history of longitude, how earth has been put in a square and how we can map the North Pole. From tiles to WebGL, I will carefully dissect how a web map is made, and how you can build one yourself. At the end, GeoJSON, PostGIS, Overpass, graticule, won't be barbaric terms anymore, but powerful friends that you will know how to use to build awesome maps and datavizualisations."
