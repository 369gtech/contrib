description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2016\n—\nC++ does not yet have complete introspection (reflection), but in many cases it may be easy to complete. We will present an example of what we think is is a general method whenever data specifications may be converted to C++ through a code generator. We have done this for processing financial market data very sensitive to latencies and obtained huge advantages of \n* Economy of effort \n* Performance \n* Reliability \n* Extensibility \nover any other option we considered. We will show: \n* How we converted the specification of market data from an important exchange, CME MDP3, into C++ types and a minimal set of variadic templates that give us full introspection capabilities \n* The code and the techniques to implement generic introspecting software components, including these concrete examples: \n* Converting any value that belongs to the specification into string \n* Testing for whether the value is null in any of the three ways the specification allows encoding of null values \n* Applying design patterns such as flyweights to traverse the data with zero or minimal performance cost \n* Subscription mechanisms \n\nWe hope these code examples will show how straightforward and maintainable metaprogramming techniques can emulate introspection for truly significant quality gains.\n\nSupport code at github:\nhttps://github.com/thecppzoo/cppcon2016/\n— \nEduardo Madrid\nSoftware Developer, Crabel Capital Management\nEduardo Madrid has over 18 years of C++ experience and works as Software Developer at Crabel Capital Management.
