description: "Speaker: Chen Hui Jing, @hj_chen\r\n\r\nThe web is a unique medium on its own and we need to establish a new normal for the web, breaking it free from the shackles of static print design. This new normal involves ceding control of our designs to the browsers that render them rather than constantly engage in this battle to dictate where every pixel should fall.\r\n\r\nWe've always been trying to transfer ideas and concepts from a static medium like print, onto a dynamic medium like the web. But their difference in nature has caused quite a bit of grief. Perhaps we should be taking a different approach to designing and building for the web, a way that better suits the nature of the medium.\r\n\r\nAbout the Speaker:\r\n\r\nHui Jing is a self-taught designer and developer with an inordinate love for CSS. Reducing lines of code in her web projects makes her extremely happy. She used to play basketball full-time and launched her web career during downtime between training sessions.\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/SingaporeCSS/events/244533222/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/eGJK/"
