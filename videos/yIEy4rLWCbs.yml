But it will not be true when an enterprise company has thousands different applications and most important is security compliance, can you get all images to rebuild and deploy to fix vulnerability issues in time on your system? Zhuang and Jordan will introduce a build as a service to free developers from design, implement and maintain build process in their daily work. It builds on standard technology Tekton. We offer several popular builders, even for Functions to represent as build template to describe how to build your source code. You just need to select one to build your source code. We also offer an image definition to monitor and manage your image which you want to build. Of course, Your image will be automatically rebuilt to fix the vulnerability issue if builder or source code is updated. \n\nhttps://sched.co/cp85"
