title: 'Reactive Transactions Masterclass by Michael Simons & Mark Paluch'
language: English
recordingDate: 1572989637
description: "How are reactive transactions supposed to work in a non-blocking, reactive application? Spring draws with its reactive transaction manager a new, strong primitive in the picture of reactive systems.\n\nWe will deeply dive into Reactive Relational Database Connectivity, the reactive specification for SQL database access and into Neo4j 4 that comes with a reactive database client. We will walk through the access of strictly transactional data sources while embracing reactive and non-blocking properties.\n\nThis highly technical Deep Dive session will visit reactive patterns for potentially highly concurrent applications that are no longer opinionated about threading.\n\nCome to this session and learn how to set up and use transactions in a reactive application. We will present R2DBC and Neo4j examples and are open for questions, comments, and discussion.\n\nBring your laptop set up with Java 8 or newer and your favorite IDE, and be prepared to think!\n\nMark is a Software Craftsman working as Spring Data project lead at Pivotal. He has a strong focus on reactive infrastructure and works on MongoDB, Redis, R2DBC, and Apache Cassandra modules. Mark is also is project lead of the Lettuce Redis driver.\n\nJava Champion, Oracle Cloud Groundbreaker. Athlete, family guy. Interested in many things. Loves Neo4j.\n\nMichael Simons:\nI work as Software Engineer for Neo4j in our drivers team.\nWe create the Neo4j Java Driver and my main responsibility is our integration with Spring Data and our own Spring Data Neo4j module and the corresponding object mapper, Neo4j-OGM.\nI wrote the first and best selling German book about Spring Boot. \nDatabases and using data in the most efficient way has been something very important to me during my whole career.\n\nI share my knowledge on my personal blog and in Java User Groups. I founded the Euregio JUG (EuregJUG) in the 3 borders area of the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany."
