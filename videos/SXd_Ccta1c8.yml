description: 'We all want to make more money, being programmers, senior programmers, architects. How to get more money doing the same amount of work and spending the same amount of time is always a big question. There are a number of key points, which you have to pay attention to if you want to boost your profile as a software engineer and increase your salary or your hourly rate. At the presentation we will go through all of them, illustrated by practical examples and real CVs Iâ€™ve been getting over the last five years from over 300 programmers.'
