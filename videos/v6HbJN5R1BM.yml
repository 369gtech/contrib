description: "Data Science is a nascent field, especially in the context of its growing influence in industry. Given this newness, the precise meaning ascribed to the term \"data science\" varies widely person-to-person, company-to-company; however, there are underlying themes that tie data science together as a field. The power of data science is bringing the scientific method beyond the ivory tower. In this talk, we will highlight common patterns of engagement through the lens of one of the data science teams at Twitter whose vision is to make the internet a safer, better, inclusive space.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
