description: "Video with transcript included: http://bit.ly/37kor33\n\nChris Ford demonstrates that music theory can be delightfully represented as code. He shows how to make music starting with the basic building block of sound, the sine wave, and gradually accumulates abstractions culminating in a canon by Johann Sebastian Bach. Examples will be live-coded in Clojure.\n\nThis presentation was recorded at QCon New York 2019: http://bit.ly/2KFk7SO\n\nThe next QCon is QCon London 2020 – March 2-4, 2020: http://bit.ly/2VfRldq\n\nFor more awesome presentations on innovator and early adopter topics check InfoQ’s selection of talks from conferences worldwide https://bit.ly/2tm9loz\n\n#Clojure #ProgrammingLanguages #Java"
