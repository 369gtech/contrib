description: "Talk recording from JSNation Live 2020, the biggest JavaScript conference in the cloud: https://live.jsnation.com\n \n# ESNext: Proposals To Look Forward To\n\nWith the yearly ECMAScript releases (ES2015..ES2019) of a lot of things have changed in JavaScript-land, and there's even more to come. This talk takes a look at a few of the newest (ES2020) and some of the upcoming ECMAScript features, which (hopefully) will become part of the ECMAScript Language Specification in the near future."
