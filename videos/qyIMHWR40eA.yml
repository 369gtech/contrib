language: English
recordingDate: 1538633410
description: "We are all undergoing a digital transformation. Our organization's information infrastructure is no different. How should we digitize our businesses core processes? How should we automate governance and compliance? How can we leverage deep learning & machine learning? How can we optimize our collaborative environments? In short, how do we modernize our information infrastructure? Today we use expensive, monolithic Enterprise Content Management Systems like; Documentum, OpenText and Alfresco. Designed in and for a different era, they simply aren't agile enough for today's business. They are holding us back. According to AIIM and Gartner the answer lies with Content Services. Modern cloud-native microservices that can deliver your businesses content to the right place at the right time. In partnership with Pivotal and DellEMC, Cardinal Health have embarked on just such a journey to modernize their Information Infrastructure through Content Services. By adopting Agile development practices and embracing Open Source Software they are reducing their reliance on traditional on-premises ECM. Using Spring Boot, Spring Data, and DellEMC's Spring Content they are building and delivering modern, agile Content Services running on Pivotal Cloud Foundry. Join Doug Hoke, one of Cardinal Health’s Enterprise Architects, and DellEMC's Paul Warren, creator of Spring Content, on a 30 minute overview of the journey so far.\n\nSpeakers:\nDoug Hoke\nEnterprise Architect, Cardinal Health\n\nPaul Warren\nCTO, Cloud Platform Team, Dell EMC"
