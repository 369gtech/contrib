description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2014.\nSpeaker: Ben Hale @nebhale\nWeb / JavaScript Track\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/creating-restful-hypermediabased-microservices-with-spring-boot\nAs data-driven applications become ubiquitous, the services that provide the data are proliferating. As teams become responsible for more and more of these services, it becomes critical that they be designed and implemented in a way that is as lightweight as possible.\n\nThis session will cover how to design micro-services as RESTful APIs and implement them with minimal code using Spring Boot. It will focus on API design using REST and HATEOAS, with live coding progressing from a tweet-length implementation all the way to a full-fledged app running in the cloud."
