description: "http://www.cppcon.org\n--\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2014\n--\nConcurrency is one of the major focuses of C++17 and one of the biggest challenges facing C++ programmers today. Hear what this panel of experts has to say about how to write concurrent C++ now and in the future.\n--\nMODERATOR: Herb Sutter - Author, chair of the ISO C++ committee, software architect at Microsoft.\nSPEAKERS:\nPABLO HALPERN - Pablo Halpern has been programming in C++ since 1989 and has been a member of the C++ Standards Committee since 2007. He is currently the Parallel Programming Languages Architect at Intel Corp., where he coordinates the efforts of teams working on Cilk Plus, TBB, OpenMP, and other parallelism languages, frameworks, and tools targeted to C++, C, and Fortran users. Pablo came to Intel from Cilk Arts, Inc., which was acquired by Intel in 2009. During his time at Cilk Arts, he co-authored the paper \"Reducers and other Cilk++ Hyperobjects\", which won best paper at the SPAA 2009 conference. His current work is focused on creating simpler and more powerful parallel programming languages and tools for Intel's customers and promoting adoption of parallel constructs into the C++ and C standards. He lives with his family in southern New Hampshire, USA. When not working on parallel programming, he enjoys studying the viola, skiing, snowboarding, and watching opera.

His interests include concurrency, programming language and library design, and modern C++. Artur is one of the co-authors of the Parallel STL proposal; his team is now working on the prototype implementation of the proposal.\nADE MILLER - Ade Miller writes C++ for fun. He wrote his first N-body model in BASIC on an 8-bit microcomputer 30 years ago and never really looked back. He started using C++ in the early 90s. Recently, he's written two books on parallel programming with C++; \"C++ AMP: Accelerated Massive Parallelism with Microsoft Visual C++\" and \"Parallel Programming with Microsoft Visual C++\". Ade spends the long winters in Washington contributing to the open source C++ AMP Algorithms Library and well as a few other projects. His summers are mostly spent crashing expensive bicycles into trees.

He works on the 'await' feature. Prior to joining C++ team, Gor was working on distributed systems in Windows Clustering team.\nMICHAEL WONG - You can talk to me about anything including C++ (even C and that language that shall remain nameless but starts with F), Transactional Memory, Parallel Programming, OpenMP, astrophysics (where my degree came from), tennis (still trying to see if I can play for a living), travel, and the best food (which I am on a permanent quest to eat).  Michael Wong is the CEO of OpenMP. He is the IBM and Canadian representative to the C++ Standard and OpenMP Committee. And did I forget to say he is a Director of ISOCPP.org and a VP, Vice-Chair of Programming Languages for Canada's Standard Council. He has so many titles, its a wonder he can get anything done.  Oh, and he chairs the WG21 SG5 Transactional Memory, and is the co-author of a number C++11/OpenMP/TM features including generalized attributes, user-defined literals, inheriting constructors, weakly ordered memory models, and explicit conversion operators. Having been the past C++ team lead to IBMÂ´s XL C++ compiler means he has been messing around with designing C++ compilers for twenty years. His current research interest, i.e. what he would like to do if he had time is in the area of parallel programming, transactional memory, C++ benchmark performance, object model, generic programming and template metaprogramming. He holds a B.Sc from University of Toronto, and a Masters in Mathematics from University of Waterloo.  He has been asked to speak at ACCU, C++Now, Meeting C++, CASCON, and many Universities, research centers and companies, except his own, where he has to listen.  Now he and his wife loves to teach their two children to be curious about everything.\n--\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
