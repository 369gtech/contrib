description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2019 by Karapet Gyumjibashyan, PMP, Ginosi Apartels and Hotels.\n\nMore info: http://androidmakers.fr/schedule/?sessionId=NIZ-9897\n\nAndroid is not only for regular mobile apps - it can be used to make self-service Kiosks as well. \n\nYou will learn from my experience of leading the development of Android-based self check-in Kiosks about the challenges of locking the system to run single app and blocking any security holes or stability issues.  You'll learn about how to architect the remote maintenance and management infrastructure for Android-based single-purpose applications in a mission-to-Mars autonomous environment and what to expect from Google's new Android Management API (now in BETA). We'll talk not only about the software, but also about the hardware and UI/UX side of creating Kiosks and the unexpected challenges and bottlenecks ahead. You'll leave the talk knowing about the peculiarities of the emerging field of COSU (company owned single use) devices and will be prepared to tackle them heads on when having your next Kiosk project on Android.\n\nAlex Karp Production"
