description: "PyData DC 2018\n\nThe Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) is a space telescope that provides 4k x 4k image series of different layers of the solar atmosphere, sending ~1.5 TB of data per day since 2010. I will present optical flow tracking techniques that was developed in Python to efficiently analyze the circulation of the plasma across the solar surface, and the tools that we use to visualize the plasma flows.\n===\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
