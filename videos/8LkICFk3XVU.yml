language: English
recordingDate: 1619107223
description: "Join us on this week in our Office Hours for Oracle Machine Learning on Autonomous Database, where Thomas Vengal, Director of Product Management for Oracle Stream Analytics (OSA/OEP) and Oracle GoldenGate, will provide the architecture and demo of using the Oracle Stream Analytics with direct calls for scoring OML models using the OML Services REST APIs in real-time.\n\nThe Oracle Machine Learning product family supports data scientists, analysts, developers, and IT to achieve data science project goals faster while taking full advantage of the Oracle platform.\n\nThe Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks offers an easy-to-use, interactive, multi-user, collaborative interface based on Apache Zeppelin notebook technology, and support SQL, PL/SQL, Python and Markdown interpreters. It is available on all Autonomous Database versions and Tiers, including the always-free editions.\n\nOML includes AutoML, which provides automated machine learning algorithm features for algorithm selection, feature selection and model tuning, in addition to a specialized AutoML UI exclusive to the Autonomous Database.\n\nOML Services is also included in Autonomous Database, where you can deploy and manage native in-database OML models as well as ONNX ML models (for classification and regression) built using third-party engines, and can also invoke cognitive text analytics."
