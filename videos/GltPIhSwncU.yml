Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe in Barcelona, May 20–23 (https://bit.ly/2B2vhMl), in Shanghai, June 24–26 (https://bit.ly/2JZcBjs), or in San Diego November 18–21 (https://bit.ly/2K031wW) in 2019.\n\nIntro: Open Policy Agent - Torin Sandall, Styra\n\nOPA is designed and implemented to integrate with a wide range of services, frameworks, and protocols. Today there are integrations with a number of different projects like Kubernetes, Spring, and PAM as well as protocols like HTTP, gRPC, and Thrift. This session will introduce new users to OPA and explain how you can integrate OPA into your apps. The session will focus on the APIs that you need to use to offload policy decisions to OPA. During the session we will walk step-by-step through the process of integrating a sample app with OPA. The session will also cover best practices to follow when integrating with OPA. Attendees can expect to leave with a strong understanding of how to integrate with OPA. We will try to make the session as interactive as possible so that people can ask questions during the step-by-step walkthrough.\n\nTo learn more click here: https://sched.co/FuLE"
