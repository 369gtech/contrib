recordingDate: 1558008004
description: "Can you take an existing C# application and write unit tests for it? Prove it. Start with the starter code and write just a few tests to exercise your C# unit test skills. I bet it will stretch you.\n\nNote that this project is a .NET Standard library. The solution video will create the unit test project in .NET Core using XUnit and Moq.\n\nChallenge Page (with solution): https://www.iamtimcorey.com/courses/c-weekly-challenges/lectures/10260165\nSubscribe to Solutions: https://www.iamtimcorey.com/p/c-weekly-challenges\n\nPractice makes perfect, right? Well, mostly, but practice is very important. This series is all about getting you to practice the things you learn. I would encourage you to do every one. See which ones are just easy refreshers and which ones are difficult learning experiences."
