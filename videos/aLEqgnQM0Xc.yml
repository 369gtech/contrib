language: English
recordingDate: 1597851177
description: "Speaker: \nBrianna McCollough (Infrastructure Program Manager, Google)\n\nAs a woman with a few years of experience in engineering I have often noticed that every team has a \"Hero\", as I have been one myself. The hero is usually identified as the hardworking, highly talented and knowledgeable team member. Contrary to appearances, the hero-based culture is extremely inefficient and creates a rigid environment that lacks the agility to respond to rapidly changing conditions â€“ customers, competitors, product lines, regulations, economics, talent, etc. \n\nIf you identify with the hero-culture in your organization, it is a red flag that your organization needs to change. I will discuss different methodologies to help organizations and teams avoid \"hero culture\"."
