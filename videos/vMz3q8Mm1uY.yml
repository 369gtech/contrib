recordingDate: 1557963457
description: "How can you get a group of computers to come to consensus? It’s a problem that computer scientists have studied for decades, but it’s gained attention again recently, as blockchains and cryptocurrencies rely on consensus algorithms to operate safely.\r\n\r\nThis talk introduces the consensus problem, and surveys many of the algorithms that claim to solve it. It covers historical academic approaches, as well as newer algorithms used in blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, detailing the mechanics and tradeoffs of each. Attendees will leave with a more intuitive understanding of how the algorithms work, and why they matter. - Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/channel/5NYvjSCMHMD"
