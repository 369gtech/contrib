description: "Google Tech Talk\nOctober 23, 2012\n\nPresented by Chris Pacione\n\nABSTRACT\n\nRecent socioeconomic shifts are driving organizations worldwide to get better at innovation—not just within traditional areas like R&D, but throughout an entire culture of work. However current research indicates that, on the whole, most organizations are still at loss as to how to make innovation more frequent and pervasive.\n\nBut this should be no surprise. Do you know anyone with a degree in innovation? Have you ever taken a course on innovation? Do you consider yourself an expert at innovation? Do you think innovation can even be taught? If so, what would *you* teach?\n\nThis talk is about how leveling-up in innovation is not only a global imperative, but possible through mastery of Human-Centered Design—the disciplined practice of developing solutions in the service of people.\n\nDesigner, entrepreneur and current CEO of LUMA Institute Chris Pacione will present how his company is helping all kinds of organizations around the world, get better at innovation and bring new and lasting value to the world.\n\nSpeaker Info\n\nAs Director and CEO of LUMA Institute, Chris leads a highly skilled, multidisciplinary team of practitioners and educators who are passionate about helping everyone \"make things better.\" Chris is a frequent speaker, teacher, and writer on the topics of innovation, design and education in the U.S., Europe, and Asia.
