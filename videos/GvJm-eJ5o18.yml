description: "A programming paradigm is basically a philosophy, style, or general approach to writing code. Possessing a fundamental understanding of different programming paradigms gives us a much wider perspective on how to solve problems in accordance to the task we have at hand. In the past, if you wanted to learn a new programming paradigm you usually had to learn a new programming language as well; but that’s not the case if you’re using a language that supports multiple paradigms, like Clojure. In this talk, I will present nine years worth of experiences (both good and bad) regarding the use of Clojure in a CS undergraduate Programming Languages course where five different programming paradigms are covered: functional programming, imperative programming, concurrent programming, metaprogramming, and relational (logic) programming.\n\nAlso, here are a few free tips to keep in mind if you want to be a successful hitchhiker in the world of multiparadigm programming with Clojure: don’t panic, use mutation only when it makes sense, and always be sure to know where your towel is!"
