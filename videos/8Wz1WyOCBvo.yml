description: "USENIX ATC '21 - Experiences in Managing the Performance and Reliability of a Large-Scale Genomics Cloud Platform\n\nMichael Hao Tong, Robert L. Grossman, and Haryadi S. Gunawi, University of Chicago\n\nWe share our technical experiences in improving the performance of long-running jobs on the Genomic Data Commons (GDC), a large-scale cancer genomics cloud platform. We show how common bioinformatics workloads can cause VMs to age after several days, causing a large number of Extended Page Table (EPT) violations that significantly impact performance. We present host- and VM-level EPT monitoring and evaluate several possible mitigation scenarios. We highlight the long investigative process required for this research, with experiments requiring many days to complete.\n\n\nView the full USENIX ATC '21 Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc21/technical-sessions"
