description: "In this video we will build a Wordpress website without writing one line of code in about 1 hour. This is a good example of how practical and fast Wordpress development can be for freelancers and beginners. We will use a little Photoshop for the simple logos and image resizing but I will include the images below if you want to skip that part and still follow along. Finally we will deploy to InMotion hosting Cpanel and setup SMTP for our contact form.\n\nImages For Site:\nhttps://www.traversymedia.com/downloads/marketone_images.zip\n\nInMotion Hosting (Affiliate Link):\nhttp://inmotion-hosting.evyy.net/c/396530/260033/4222\n\nDesktop Server Download:\nhttps://serverpress.com/\n\nFree Theme:\nhttps://themeisle.com/themes/parallax-one/\n\n?
