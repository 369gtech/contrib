language: English
recordingDate: 1597706535
description: 'Reaching out into space may seem like it would require a PhD and thousands of dollars of equipment, but it can actually be done for about $100. In this talk I will detail how to get started talking to satellites using basic equipment. With just a Ham Radio license and some gear, you too can talk to satellites and by extension people thousands of miles away.'
