description: '"Responsive" currently seems to mostly mean that your website adapts to a changing viewport width. But there are so many other factors to which web interfaces can respond - time of day, geolocation, battery level, connection speed, viewport height, distance from user to screen, existence and type of pointing device, existence and type of text entry device, pixel density and colour depth of the screen. The list is virtually endless. There''s a compromise to be made, between ease of measurement, cost and impact of being responsive. What are the right factors to invest in for the next few years?'
