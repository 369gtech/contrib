description: "Playing some kind of games with your colleagues is a great way to bond and distract your mind. Playing is more fun when it's competitive though, which is why we need a tool to keep track our leagues. So I decided to build such a tool going Clojure full stack (API, frontend and even CSS).\n\nIn this talk I will first give an introduction to the Elo algorithm and then dive into the world of reagent/re-frame and functional reactive programming, using this project as an example for live demos and code samples."
