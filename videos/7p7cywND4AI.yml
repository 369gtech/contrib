title: 'Beyond the basics of SonarQube: improve your JavaScript code even further, Johan Janssen'
recordingDate: 1446556666
description: "SonarQube is (becoming) more or less the standard tool for managing Java code quality. Unfortunately most developers use it just as a replacement for separate Checkstyle, PMD and code coverage tools. SonarQube is capable of so much more than that, over time SonarQube will even replace the Checkstyle and PMD rulesets with their own ruleset.\n\nThis presentation will explain a lot of the more advanced features and plugins SonarQube has to offer. The topics include: measuring coverage of a running Java application in an application server, JavaScript plugin, Pitest plugin, compare, measure, code review, hotspots, architectural constraints, package tangle index, PMD rules for unit test quality, incremental analyses and more.\n\nAfter this session you will be able to get more out of SonarQube and increase the quality of your software even further."
