Metal³ enables the management of bare metal hosts via custom resources managed through the Kubernetes API as well as the monitoring of bare metal host metrics to Prometheus. This presentation will explain the motivations behind creating the project and what has been accomplished so far. This will be followed by an architectural overview and description of the Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) for describing bare metal hosts, leading to a demonstration of using Metal³ in a Kubernetes cluster.  \n\nhttps://sched.co/UaZr"
