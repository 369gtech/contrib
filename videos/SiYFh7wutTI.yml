description: "Web developers have long heralded Progressive Enhancement for delivering web experiences in \"layers\" (HTML, images, CSS, and then JS). It sounds so obvious and elegant, right?

It's time to peel back the layers and re-envision how the web is assembled.\n\nSlides: https://speakerdeck.com/getify/fouc-and-the-death-of-progressive-enhancement"
