description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io\_The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nDelivering Cloud Native Applications Across Multiple Clouds and Clusters - Henry Zhang, VMware & Mingming Pei, Netease \n\nKubernetes has become the standard of application platform. Organizations often have multiple Kubernetes clusters residing in multiple clouds. There're many challenges to manage applications in such a scenario: e.g. distributing images, delivering applications and balancing workload.  Following the guideline of the App Delivery SIG, we manage applications in 3 aspects: definition and artifacts, application deployment and workload management. In production, workload can be delivered to different clusters based on their weights and taking advantage of the cloud elasticity and resources on different cloud providers.  This talk shares our experience on managing a multi-cloud production system: * Container image cross cloud distribution * Cross-cluster application delivery * Cross-cluster traffic control & elastic application * Consistency of application definition and underlying resource \n\nhttps://sched.co/cp8N"
