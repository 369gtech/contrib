description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nkOps: Recent Advances and the Journey to an OSS Kubernetes Distribution - Peter Rifel, DataDog; Ciprian Hacman, eyeo; John Gardiner Myers, Proofpoint; Ole Markus With, Sportradar\n\nkOps is a kubernetes subproject to manage and operate kubernetes clusters, delivering the full end-to-end user experience. We’ll give a quick introduction to kOps, and cover recent advances. Learn about better security, certificate rotation; support for containerd, arm64, azure; dedicated apiserver nodes; binding cloud roles to kubernetes service accounts; initial ipv6 support; much deeper testing and more! We’ll then deep-dive into how we are continuing to deliver the end-to-end experience, even as the core kubernetes repository extracts out networking, storage and cloud support … are we building a distro? What are the implications for how we can continue to develop and build kOps, and what can we learn from traditional Linux distros?"
