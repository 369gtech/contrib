We’ll explore a case study of Agile applied to Marketing and discuss the benefits of aligning your organization’s use of Agile across departments along with the mindset shift necessary. Instead of focusing on who you can sell to, the focus is shifted to truly connecting with who needs your product or service most while leveraging rapid iterations for maximum output. Discover the value of split testing, inspecting and adapting, and applying an iterative process to your Marketing department. Agile Marketing allows you to adjust your focus and streamline your company processes aligned with Sales and Marketing to attract and service your ideal clients with exponential results.\n\nAbout the speaker\n\nMaria Matarelli is a Certified Scrum Trainer (CST) who travels the world on one-way tickets consulting and training companies on reaching true agility.
