description: "Cloud Foundry Availability - Julian Fischer, anynines GmbH\n\nThe definition and measurement of availability is an integral part of any systemâ€™s operational concept. This talk guides through the definition of availability of a Cloud Foundry based platform. This involves the question on what subsystems are relevant to the definition and how they contribute to the availability metric in the end. Once, a definition has been found a brief the measurement of availability is discussed. With a well defined availability metric at hand, the journey of uptime optimization can be started and will be briefly elaborated. By the end of this journey, you will have learned about defining, measuring and improving the availability of not only Cloud Foundry but complex distributed systems in general and know why maintenance windows become obsolete.\n\nAbout Julian Fischer\nJulian Fischer is CEO of anynines, a well established platform consultancy.
