description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2017\n—\nC++ (and C) have always had unique challenges when it comes to build systems. In addition to discussing the common problems that C++ build systems face, this talk will discuss the (abbreviated) history of build systems, where the current build system ecosystem is, where it is heading, and where it might be in the near future. Expect a lively presentation, that is both light on code and heavy on information.\n— \nIsabella Muerte: MNMLSTC, C++ Bruja\n\nIsabella Muerte is a C++ Bruja and Build System Trash Goblin. She taught herself to program at 20 by writing a build system and immediately regretting the decision. Her first computer ran Windows Millennium Edition and her parents forbade her from upgrading to anything else for 5 years. She is still bitter about this. She is an avid fan of C++ and a semi-active member of the C++ community. In her spare time, she is interested in burritos, stoner rock, sludge and doom metal, open source, tattoos, and computer keyboards.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
