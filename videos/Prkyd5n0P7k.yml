description: "Colton McAnlis\n\nThis session will present GRITS, a player vs. player shooter game, built entirely using Google technologies. In this talk, we'll walk through building an HTML5 canvas engine, serving the content, networking using Websockets, using NodeJS, social integration and more.\n\nAttendees to this session will walk away with a big-picture view of all the Google technologies that are relevant to web gaming, a deep understanding of how to get started with them, and have the ability to see them live, in action with the source code to the published game.\n\nFor all I/O 2012 sessions, go to https://developers.google.com/io/"
