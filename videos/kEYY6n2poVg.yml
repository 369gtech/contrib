title: 'Jfokus 2011: Scrum & XP - beyond the trenches'
recordingDate: 1622464779
description: '4 years have passed since I wrote "Scrum and XP from the Trenches". What have I learned since then, and what would I have done differently if I could go back in time? During the past few years I''ve mostly been "trench-hopping", i.e. helping lots of different organizations implement agile software development in practice, and talking to other people that do the same. Consequently there are now several things in the book that I don''t agree with any more, so this talk is the first step towards a followup article :o)'
