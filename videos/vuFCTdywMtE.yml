Java 9 extended this with some nice new features. For many people it is hard to grasp the idea of functional style programming after so many years of purely working in the imperative OOP style. The opportunities Java gives us out of the box are massive on the other hand with great power comes great responsibility. Let me point out common mistakes that are made when integrating functional style programming in your every day Java project and how to prevent this. This way you can make better, cleaner and more readable code. But even more important, you will be able to utilize the functional code constructions in Java 9 to it's full potential!.. and maybe, you even start to like it.\n\n \nBrian Vermeer \nFrom Blue4IT\nSoftware Engineer for Blue4IT working consultancy based on mainly Java projects for the Top-100 companies in the Netherlands. Passionate about Java, (Pure) Functional Programming and Cybersecurity. Co-writer on the published Research paper: Plagiarism Detection for Haskell with Holmes. Besides being an engineer he is a Reservist at the Royal Netherlands Air Force and a Taekwondo Master."
