description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nDiscussion & Comments: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2019\n—\nThe ranges revolution is nearly upon us! C++20 will include concept-enabled, range-based versions of all the standard algorithms you know and love, as well as new “views” which can transform the way you write code. In this talk we’ll offer an overview of the ranges features currently in the C++20 draft, with examples of how you can use them to reduce verbosity, avoid bugs and improve the correctness of your code, and in some cases get better performance. We’ll also cover the currently-available ranges implementations that you can use today, without having to wait for the next version of the standard.\n\nIf you've heard the buzz around ranges and are wondering what they'll bring and how they'll benefit your code-base, then this is the talk for you.\n— \nTristan Brindle\n\nTristan is a freelance developer, C++ trainer and BSI committee member based in London. He’s the author of NanoRange, a C++14-compatible Ranges implementation, and lead tutor for C++ London Uni, a not-for-profit organisation offering free weekly C++ classes for students in London and around the world.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
