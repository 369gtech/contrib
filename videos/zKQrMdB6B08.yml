description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2014.\nSpeakers:Juergen Hoeller, Stéphane Nicoll\nCore Spring Track\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/201409-springonecachingmessaging\nThis session showcases major new features along the lines of two key themes in Spring Framework 4.1: We’ll start with numerous improvements around the caching abstraction, as requested by the community, including the support for JCache (JSR-107) standard annotations. We’ll then move on to messaging-related features such as annotated JMS listener endpoints with flexible method signatures, using the messaging abstraction introduced in Spring Framework 4.0 and therefore aligning our core JMS support with our STOMP endpoint style."
