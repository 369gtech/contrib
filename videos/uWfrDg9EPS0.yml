description: "Enterprise Java is old. Our heritage is ancient practices, patterns, and even cargo cult programming. With Java EE 7, you can remove an amazing amount of clutter just by focusing on the business domain and ignoring ancient  best  practices. In Java 8, you can optimize the code even further: lambdas and Nashorn play well with Java EE 7. In this session, you will see the presenter code, test, and deploy a Java EE 7 application and cover the design choices  on the go.  Questions and discussion are highly appreciated!\n\n\nAuthor:\nAdam Bien\nConsultant and author Adam Bien is an Expert Group member for the Java EE 6 and 7, EJB 3.X, JAX-RS, and JPA 2.X JSRs.
