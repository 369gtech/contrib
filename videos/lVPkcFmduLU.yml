Learn more about how technology was used in the transformation of a storied organization with more than one hundred years of success. Understand why Liberty Mutual chose to partner with Pivotal, ultimately architecting and implementing a solution without 3rd party help. Find out about how developers are freed from the operational aspects of code creation to be more creative, productive, and do more fulfilling work.\n\nSpeaker: Chris Bartlow; Senior Director, Liberty Mutual."
