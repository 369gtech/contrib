recordingDate: 1525694487
description: 'Microservices are still all over the place and people continue to experience various great realizations on the way to Microservices architecture. In this talk we will discuss what Microservices are and I will give some hints when you shouldn''t do and when you should do Micrtoservices. Sometimes you even have no choice, but go Distributed. In any case if Microservices is the way to go you have to be prepared. We will discuss a few characteristics of distributed systems that I find sexy and mostly helpful to manage the complexity. We will talk about REST, Streams and Sockets, Reactive Programming, Reactive Systems, Event-Driven Architecture, Serverless Architecture, The Web, ACID, SOLID, Fault Tolerance, Backpressure even OOP, DDD and the Actor Model. We will mention Akka, Spring, Servlets, Tomcat and Netty, NodeJS and Vert.x, Kafka, Cassandra, Firebase and even Wordpress.'
