description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM SF 2020 - http://bit.ly/2wpn0SM\n\nGet involved in Code Sync's next conference - https://codesync.global\n\n---\n\nOBSERVABILITY FOR ELIXIR MICROSERVICES\nby Vamsi Chitters\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nObservability, Elixir, Fintech\n\nABSTRACT\nThis talk provides a high-level overview of observability at Brex for our microservice architecture in Elixir. In particular, it details the custom libraries and frameworks we use as core primitives to best understand how our systems behave, as well as the tooling we use to surface metrics, logs and traces to developers.\n\nSlides & full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/vamsi-chitters/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - VAMSI CHITTERS\nEntrepreneur interested in observability and building large scale systems\n\nVamsi is a software engineer building core systems at Brex. Previously, he was a co-founder at Elph (a Y-Combinator company that was acquired by Brex) and prior to that, worked on the Knowledge Graph Infrastructure team at Google. \n\nVamsi pursued an M.S. in CS with a specialization in AI & ML at Stanford and a B.S. in EE & CS at UC Berkeley.\n\nMore on Vamsi Chitters: https://codesync.global/speaker/vamsi-chitters/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM SF 2020\nCode BEAM SF is powered by Code Sync.
