description: "PaaS vs CaaS - Where Should I Ship My Code - Johannes Hiemer & Marco Henning, evoila\n\nModern software development methodologies are subjected to continuous change. While development cycles continue to abridge from weeks or month to days or even hours, requirements for features and reliability tend to increase. Agile development allowed for faster delivery of new capabilities on a regular basis, however value might not be put into production due to a lack of alignment with operative processes. Multiple cloud service offerings have evolved over the last decade, tackling problems on different levels, but Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Container as a Service (CaaS) have proven themselves to be the most functional. Although both offerings share similar concepts, their approaches in application development may differ greatly. However their utilization doesn’t have to be mutually exclusive. With their recently announced “Container Runtime“ Cloud Foundry (CF) extended their existing “Application Runtime“ offering, now supporting PaaS as well as CaaS workloads. In the end, no platform is going to be perfect for every use case. Therefore existing applications will have to be evaluated against general guidelines to plan, what it will take to get them to run in a cloud, while new applications will have to be designed in a cloud-native manner to utilize the platforms to its fullest extent. In their talk the speakers will guide the audience through the decision process of where to run different kinds of workloads.\n\nhttps://cfseu18.sched.com/event/FRy9/paas-vs-caas-where-should-i-ship-my-code-johannes-hiemer-marco-henning-evoila"
