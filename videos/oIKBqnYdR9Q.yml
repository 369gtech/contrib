title: 'Mark Heckler - Building Reactive Pipelines: How to go from scalable apps to scalable systems'
language: English
recordingDate: 1555263232
description: 'Going from imperative, blocking code to a reactive programming model enables us to scale our apps in ways that arenâ€™t possible with a thread scale-out approach, which is a good thing! But as with all optimizations, one must examine & address the system holistically or all we accomplish is moving bottlenecks around, creating or finding new chokepoints as we tune certain applications/services. This is not so good. In this session, the presenter discusses: How Project Reactor builds on reactive streams to help you create performant & scalable reactive microservices Message brokers & streaming platforms like RabbitMQ & Apache Kafka * How Spring Cloud Stream leverages Reactor to provide fully reactive pipelines for system-wide (ridiculous!) scalability The presenter will code all examples using 100% open source software live and in real time. This is not an abstract discussion, come to gain real, practical knowledge!'
