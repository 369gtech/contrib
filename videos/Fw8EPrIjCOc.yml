description: "Jeff Lindsay ( http://www.progrium.com ) at Google talking about Web Hooks. Slides here: http://www.slideshare.net/progrium/web-hooks-google-tech-talk\r\n\r\nThis talk introduces the concept of web hooks: simple HTTP callbacks with huge implications. This model allows web services to be customized by the user and tightly integrated with each other unlike anything before. Chock-full of demos and real world examples, this talk also shares an under-appreciated vision of the web that most of the experts have missed: a vision of user-generated functionality and the *real* programmable web."
