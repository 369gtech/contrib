title: 'Velocity 2012: John Rauser, "Investigating Anomalies"'
recordingDate: 1340808793
description: "\"The most exciting phrase to hear in science, the one that heralds new discoveries, is not 'Eureka!' but 'That's funny...'\" -Isaac Asimov\n\nThis is a talk about the wonderful things that happen when you chase down anomalies in your data. When an experiment produces counterintuitive results, or a lovely relationship in your data is spoiled by outliers, a natural tendency is to toss the result aside and try again. But when you take the time to truly understand anomalous results, often one of two things happens: either you destroy your hypothesis, or you make it bulletproof.\n\nJohn Rauser\n\nAmazon\n\nJohn has been extracting value from large datasets for over 15 years at companies ranging from hedge funds to small data-driven startups to amazon.com. He has deep experience in machine learning, data visualization, website performance and real-time fault analysis. An empiricist at heart, John's optimism and can-do attitude make \"Just do the experiment!\" his favorite call to arms."
