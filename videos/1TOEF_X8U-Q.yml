description: "Recent advancements in AI have made powerful content-manipulation tools - that can create\nrealistic images and videos - accessible to the public. Deep-Fakes have already undermined\ntrust in democracy, incited violence and damaged the reputation of brands and individuals.\nThis has motivated the research of technologies that can catch the fakes, such as AdVerif.ai.\nIn this session, Or Levi - Founder of AdVerif.ai, will take us through the emerging Fake News\narms race, between “Bad AI” for generating fakes and “Good AI” for detecting them. Learn how AI can help fight Fake News with a spectrum of tools, ranging from Machine Vision for detecting manipulated images to Natural Language Processing for identifying psycho-linguistic features, and data pipelines for Deep Learning at the scale of billions of items.\n\nVisit the largest developer playground in Europe!\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/wearedevelopers\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/WeAreDevs\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/_wearedevelopers/\n\n#WeAreDevs"
