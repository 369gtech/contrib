description: "Speaker: Rahul Bansal\n\nIndia has the second largest population in the world. More than a million people are directly working in IT sector.\n\nYet, WordPress agency or in general any software agency in India, or even in South Asia is often mistaken as that agency which does low quality work for ridiculously low rates!\n\nWhen we started in 2009, it was very clear that we are not going to be part of this “race to the bottom” culture. We wanted to work on projects that were exciting and challenging. A kind of work that makes you proud at the end of the day!\n\nI would like to talk about how we used innovative methods to hire passionate people, what challenges we faced in motivating our employees to be core contributors, nurturing a culture of giving back to open source and how it all helped us stand out.\n\nThe result – I am glad to say that I have the privilege to lead and work in one of the most talked about WordPress agencies in India today, for right reasons!\n\nAbout the speaker:\n\nRahul Bansal came across WordPress in 2007, looking for ways to customize his blog. He was a full-time professional blogger earning a living through blogging only.\n\nTinkering with WordPress led to releasing his first WordPress plugin in 2008. He started to enjoy developing on WordPress and soon started rtCamp — India’s first WordPress-only agency in 2009.\n\nIn last 8 years, he has been involved in many open-source WordPress projects such as rtMedia and EasyEngine, that are used on thousands of active sites.\n\nApart from contributing code, he has spoken at many WordCamps and other tech events, including the inaugural Nginx conference in San Francisco in 2014.\n\nRahul is also the WordCamp Pune organizer, and is involved with WordPress Hindi translation.\n\nEvent Page: https://2016.singapore.wordcamp.org/\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/VfFf/"
