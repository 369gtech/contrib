title: 'DrupalCon Vienna 2017: Easy decoupled sitebuilding with GraphQL and Next.js'
recordingDate: 1506433622
description: "JavaScript and rich frontend have certainly taken the world by storm. At the same time RESTful APIs have been the norm in Drupal and other backends for years now. But still building a decoupled site continues to have a high overhead because of the setup needed and the nature of RESTful APIs.\n\nIn this session we'll examine how to use GraphQL, a communications protocol, and Next.js a Universal JavaScript framework using React. Together with this combination front end developers can accelerate decoupled site development, and enjoy full freedom from the Drupal sitebuilding practises.\n\nBuilding a decoupled server side rendered React front end with optimal performance and SEO has never been so easy as with GraphQL and Next.js, but there are certain pitfalls you should be aware of.\n\n- Jani Tarvainen"
