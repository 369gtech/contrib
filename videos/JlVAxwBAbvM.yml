description: "Google TechTalks\nMarch 8, 2006\n\nJim whitehead\nJim Whitehead is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of California, Santa Cruz. He has recently been developing a new degree program on computer gaming, the BS in Computer Game Engineering. Jim received his PhD in Information and Computer Science from UC Irvine, in 2000\n\nAbstract:\nAlmost all software contains undiscovered bugs, ones that have not yet been exposed by testing or by users. Wouldn't it be nice if there was a way to know the location of these bugs? This talk presents two approaches for predicting the location of bugs. The bug cache contains 10% of the files in a software project."
