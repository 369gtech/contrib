description: "“What do I need to learn to become a WordPress developer?” This question pops up in forums, social media, and everywhere else on a daily basis. I think a better question is “How do I prepare for a future that looks nothing like the status quo?” \n\nTech is changing at incredible speed, and what we consider important skills today may be meaningless a year from now. This talk is a discussion of what technologies are on the horizon, how the web and the internet will change, and how we can all prepare for a future with or without WordPress.\n\nEVENT: \n\nWordCamp 2017\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nMorten Rand-Hendriksen\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nThe original video was published on WordPress YouTube channel with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex8fMxXJDJw&t=29s"
