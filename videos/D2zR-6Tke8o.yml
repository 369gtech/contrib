description: "Find more information here: https://berlinbuzzwords.de/session/running-high-performance-and-fault-tolerant-elasticsearch-clusters-docker\n\nWe’ve learned how to run Docker containers. And we’ve learned how to run Elasticsearch. However, to run containerized Elasticsearch nodes and to do that effectively -- and at scale -- takes a little more knowledge and work. Sure, containers can be easily started and stopped; but how do you do that with Elasticsearch inside them?\n\nIn this talk we’ll quickly run over the basic Docker+Elasticsearch setup and focus on harder problems:\n\n    Architecting for Elasticsearch fault tolerance and high availability in containerized setup - using sharding, replication, node and shard-awareness for keeping your cluster green\n    Running Elasticsearch in different modes with re-usability in mind\n    Optimizing and tuning Elasticsearch for popular use cases like ELK\n    Ops/Devops - monitoring Elasticsearch & Docker together - which metrics to watch, what they mean, how to act on them and first of all, how to watch them\n\nTakeaways:\n\n    Running Elasticsearch on Docker\n    Performance implications of running Elasticsearch on Docker\n    How to create highly available and fault tolerant clusters\n    Proper Elasticsearch setup in a container\n    Tuning Elasticsearch\n    Which metrics should be looked at when dealing with Elasticsearch\n    Monitoring containers and applications running inside of them"
