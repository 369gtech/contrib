description: "Kirk Pepperdine, Director, Kodewerk Ltd.\n\nUnified logging is a new logging framework in the JVM that replaces all the logging of previous releases. The -Xlog flag will replace all the -XX:+PrintXX flags you would normally use. This session explores how you can use this new JVM component to get information out of the JVM. Additionally, it looks at the ever-evolving jcmd tool as a means to having your JVM spill even more of its secrets."
