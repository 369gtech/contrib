title: 'Functional Web Development – An Introduction to React.js with Bertrand Karerangabo'
recordingDate: 1412801019
description: "React.js is a UI framework created by Facebook and Instagram. Its primary design goal is to help build large applications with data that changes over time. To do so at scale, conventional wisdom and some long-held assumptions about software development had to be challenged. Gone are the “M” and the “C” in MVC. Gone are templates and special HTML directives. Gone also are traditional data-bindings. The results are applications that are extremely fast and reliable, out of the box.\n\nBertrand Karerangabo will dive into those concepts that make React.js unique and along the way, also learn how to build web applications from simple, composable and reusable components.\n\nBertrand Karerangabo\nrangle.io\nhttp://rangle.io/\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
