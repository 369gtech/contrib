description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM V 2020 - https://codesync.global/conferences/code-beam-v\n\nGet involved in the next Code Sync conference - https://codesync.global \n\n---\n\nFROM ELIXIR TO ERLANG - EXPERIENCE REPORT\nby Michal Muskala\n\n\nABSTRACT\nIs the tooling in Erlang really that bad? Are macros in Elixir actually creating that much confusion? And what about the syntax?\n\nOver the last couple months, I worked almost exclusively with Erlang after many years spent with Elixir. In this talk I'm going to share my reflections on the state of both languages and what they can learn from one another. I'll explore things that I found surprising, some that I miss, and couple that were delightful.\n\nSlides & full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/michal-muskala52/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - MICHAL MUSKALA\nEngineer at WhatsApp Erlang Team and Elixir contributor\n\nSoftware engineer, open-source developer, speaker and trainer. Michal is a member of the Erlang team at WhatsApp working on the language and its tooling and a member of the Ecto core team. He also contributes to maintains multiple open source projects including Elixir and OPT and maintains some of his own including Jason - the most popular projects on hex.pm.\n\nWhen not programming, he enjoys reading, travelling, and sailing - no matter if sunny, rainy or stormy. It's even better if all of those are combined!\n\nMore on Michal Muskala: https://codesync.global/speaker/michal-muskala52/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM V 2020\nCode BEAM V is powered by Code Sync.
