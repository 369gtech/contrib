Most speakers wish to deliver a presentation that keeps the audience engaged from beginning to end. The key to accomplishing this resides outside of whichever tool you use. In this talk, we’ll look at five things you can do to improve your next presentation.\n\nThe ideas we will present are tool-agnostic.
