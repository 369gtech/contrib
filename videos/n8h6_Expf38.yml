title: 'How do you deploy a machine learning model as a web service within Azure? (22 of 28)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1594396830
description: "In this video, you will gather all of the important pieces of your model to be able to deploy it as a web service on Azure so that your other applications can call it on the fly. First, you will get the best run from your model and register the model within Azure. Then, you will create an inference configuration; the script and environment to run the data through when you are calling the model from your app. Then you will create an aci config, which is essentially describing the compute needed to run this model on new data. Finally, you will learn how to actually deploy and test the webservice.\n\nhttps://www.aka.ms/DeployModel"
