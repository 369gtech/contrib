description: "Some tools are so useful that once you've used them in one project, it is hard to work on other projects without them. React was certainly that way for me when I first started, and now TypeScript has become the same way. This talk will cover why typed JavaScript, especially in large codebases, is worth the added effort. I will discuss my personal experiences - the good, the bad, and the ugly - and talk about why I can't seem to start a project without `npm install typescript`.\n\nEVENT:\n\nAmsterdam JS 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nAndy Mockler\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nAmsterdam JS Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nJS Nation YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQM428Hwrvxla8DCgjGONSQ"
