title: 'Andrew Nguyen - Healthcare "big" Data from Data Management to Web Apps'
recordingDate: 1395719749
description: "Being a healthcare data startup presents us with several key challenges: every customer's needs are slightly different, we need to build end-to-end solutions, we need to do so with minimal resources, and we need to make it repeatable and scalable.\n\nThe \"big\" data problem in healthcare is actually thousands of little data problems. Given the same data, a cardiologist and a surgeon will interpret them very differently. Even something as simple as counting the number of patient visits or tracking marital status becomes non-trivial.\n\nThis problem gets magnified as we factor in the number of data systems within a typical hospital (hundreds), and the number of clinical environments (thousands of hospitals, nursing facilities, etc.). There are hundreds of millions of unique data needs, translating into as many data requirements. Our product, a cloud-managed, on-premise appliance, is designed around this massive data variety problem while making the data easily available and accessible for everyone downstream.\n\nClojure(script) have become an integral part of our development model, letting us blur the lines between development and runtime requirements. We've been using Clojure(script) for 4 months throughout our entire stack. We will share our journey and lessons learned along the way."
