language: English
recordingDate: 1586568799
description: "Why are there so many talks about rainbows? And what’s on the other side? Rainbows are visions, but not illusions, and rainbows have something to hide!\n\n\nFrustratingly, infrared photographers find that they can never photograph the invisible extra stripes beyond red in a rainbow. Instead, they’ll only see a single monochromatic band! We will explore why, and dive into the boolean solution to make a three-channel model that reveals a full -olor unseen world! Then, we’ll look at pictures of a world entirely in a spectrum we can’t see!\n\n\nEVENT:\n!!Con West 2020\n\n\nSPEAKER:\nPhil Warren\n\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed)\n\n\nATTRIBUTION CREDITS:\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EB06NHlXiow"
