title: 'Getting the best out of Spring Cloud, Kubernetes, and Istio by Magnus Larsson'
recordingDate: 1581886498
description: "Developing, testing, deploying, and managing a system landscape of cooperating microservices can be challenging, to say the least. With tools introduced during the last five years like Spring Cloud, Docker, Kubernetes, and Istio, this has become more manageable.\n\nEach of these tools works great by itself, but it can be challenging to understand how to use them together in an advantageous way. In most areas they complement each other, but in some areas they overlap. It is not always obvious which one to choose for a particular situation. Examples of areas where the tools are overlapping are service discovery, gateway service, microservice configuration, and resilience mechanisms.\n\nThis presentation will discuss how to choose between the alternatives.\n\nMagnus Larsson\nCallista\n\nRecorded at Jfokus 2020 in Stockholm 4th of february\nhttp://www.jfokus.se"
