I don't think so! In this talk, we will see how we can use Elixir and Scenic to build a copy of the immortal 1972 Atari classic. Retro gaming enthusiasts will love this talk for the fun trivia, while Elixir enthusiasts will love it for the live coding madness! At the end of the talk, you should know how to setup your own game using Scenic, while having learned a couple of tricks that are almost fifty years old, yet tremendously effective.\n\nSlides & full abstract: \n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - JU LIU\n\n\nJu was born in China, moved to Italy as a kid, grew up eating a lot of pasta, and started messing around with computers. He now lives in London and works for NoRedInk. He loves to solve hard problems and build amazing products. When he’s not doing that, he’s probably rock climbing.\n\nMore on Ju Liu: \n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM V 2020\nCode BEAM V is powered by Code Sync.
