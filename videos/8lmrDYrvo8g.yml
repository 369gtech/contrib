title: 'Multi-cloud portability for Go applications - Praveen Yedidi - NDC Sydney 2020'
language: English
recordingDate: 1630507219
description: "Often teams want to deploy robust applications in multi-cloud and hybrid-cloud environments, and migrate their workloads between cloud providers without significant changes to their code. To achieve this, they attempt to decouple their applications from provider-specific APIs in order to produce simpler and more portable code. However the short-term pressure to ship features means teams often sacrifice longer-term efforts toward portability. As a result, most Go applications running in the cloud are tightly coupled to their initial cloud provider.\n\nAs an alternative, teams can use Go Cloud, a set of open generic cloud APIs, to write simpler and more portable cloud applications. Go Cloud also sets the foundation for an ecosystem of portable cloud libraries to be built on top of these generic APIs. Go Cloud makes it possible for teams to meet their feature development goals while also preserving the long-term flexibility for multi-cloud and hybrid-cloud architectures."
