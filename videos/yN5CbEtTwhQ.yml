description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM SF 2020 - http://bit.ly/2wpn0SM\n\nGet involved in Code Sync's next conference - https://codesync.global\n\n---\n\nPLAYING WITH LAMBDA CALCULUS\nby Bernardo Amorim\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nlambda calculus reduction\n\n\nABSTRACT\nWe all learn a lot about Turing Machines and why it is an important model and its correlation to the microprocessors we have today. However, not everyone learn about another important model: Lambda Calculus. We'll learn a little bit about simple untyped lambda calculus, implement some data structures using only functions (no other Elixir data type) and hopefully have some fun.\n\nSlides & full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/bernardo-amorim/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - BERNARDO AMORIM\nBuilt a bank using Elixir and created a Word to HTML converter in Ruby that also converted math formulas to MathML.\n\nBernardo started playing around with HTML and JS when he was 11. At age 14 learned PHP through WikiBooks so he could make his MU Online private server registration website and with 1 day running the server learned what SQL Injection is the hard way. Since then he has developer a lot of systems and occupied a range of roles, from intern to CTO of a small startup (also known as the solo developer). Currently he is working with Sunshine Cybernetics and learning about dependent typed languages, interaction combinators and lambda calculus while helping building tools for the next generation of developers.\n\nMore on Bernardo Amorim: https://codesync.global/speaker/bernardo-amorim/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM SF 2020\nCode BEAM SF is powered by Code Sync.
