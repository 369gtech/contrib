recordingDate: 1493231427
description: "There are unmaintained modules and even subsystems\_in core. Now what?\n\nDo we have a hit list to remove by Drupal 9?\n\nAre any of those essential and need to be brought back to life?\n\nWill you cry if the color module is kicked out of core?\n\nWhen was the last time you enabled forum module on a site?\n\nLet's talk about the maintainability of Drupal core, lessons learned after Drupal 8's release, and whether core and some modules would be better off parting ways."
