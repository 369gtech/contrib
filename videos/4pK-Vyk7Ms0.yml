description: "IoT, M2M, V2V: The needs for and evolution towards end-to-end encryption\n\nYou may remember the first versions of WhatsApp and their terrible, insecure encryption. Back then—and before Snowden's revelation—privacy wasn't a major concern. In 2019, WhatsApp and a number of other messaging apps are using end-to-end encryption, or encryption that doesn't allow relay servers to see your messages. The situation for IoT, machine-to-machine, and vehicle-to-vehicle communications is a bit like mobile messaging in 2012: at best connections are encrypted using TLS from clients to server, but end-to-end encryption is almost inexistent. Shouldn't business-critical and privacy-sensitive data have the same level of protection as WhatsApp messages? We believe so, and will describe how to design and deploy strong end-to-end encryption for IoT networks, based on our experience developing such a product.\n\nThe speech took on 8th May 2019 on DevTrends Stage during Infoshare 2019.\n\n#IoT #M2M #V2V"
