description: "What's the absolute minimum you can compress data to? - Entropy conjures up visions of chemistry and physics, but how does it apply to binary codes and computer science? Professor David Brailsford continues his discussion of compression.\n\nAddendum: the formula at 4:40 is the \"weighted average bits for that state\" \nrather than the total number of bits - (log^2)\n\nOriginal Professor Brailsford film on compression: http://youtu.be/Lto-ajuqW3w \nProfessor Brailsford on Error Detection: http://youtu.be/-15nx57tbfc\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/computerphile\nhttps://twitter.com/computer_phile\n\nThis video was filmed and edited by Sean Riley.\n\nComputer Science at the University of Nottingham: http://bit.ly/nottscomputer\n\nComputerphile is a sister project to Brady Haran's Numberphile.
