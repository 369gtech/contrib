description: '[BETTER AUDIO RE-UPLOAD] A widely used approach to displaying realistic FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) ocean water in today''s games is presented. A similar approach has been employed in movies like Titanic and Waterworld and in games like Assassin''s Creed 3 and Crysis just to name a few. In this presentation we will talk about the matematical aspects that are at the heart of this technique up to the shading aspects that will represent the visual appearance of water and also how the LOD of the water mesh is managed. A demo implemented under Unreal Engine 4 or videos will be presented to better explain such a complex topic.'
