description: "Don't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects - Learn more at https://kubecon.io\n\nCortex: Ingesting and Querying 100s of Billions of Samples Per Day - Goutham Veeramachaneni, Grafana Labs \n\nPrometheus is the popular open-source monitoring system that is easy to use and scales quite well. We will start with a quick introduction of Prometheus and then move on to the problem of building a horizontally scalable, distributed version of Prometheus to handle _infinite_ scale: Cortex. We will look at the architecture, see how it is designed with decoupled ingest and query paths that can be scaled independently. We will start with the original architecture of Cortex, see how it evolved and the bottlenecks and issues we hit that inspired the changes. We will see what the community is working on now and what the future holds for Cortex! \n\nhttps://sched.co/YVxo"
