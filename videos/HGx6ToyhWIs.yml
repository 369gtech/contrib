language: English
recordingDate: 1544209886
description: "CSS floats have been the primary way that we define web layout for almost the past decade. They’ve worked pretty well over the years but times are changing. Flexbox is becoming the new norm for layout and solves some of the main gripes we deal with when using floats. Some of the new concepts may be a bit difficult to grasp in the beginning but in this talk we’ll focus on practical ways that Flexbox is used when creating modern interfaces.\n\nBermon Painter\nUser Experience Designer, bermonpainter.com\nhttps://twitter.com/bermonpainter\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
