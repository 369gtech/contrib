title: '"Samba 2020: Why are we still in the 1980s for authentication?" - Andrew Bartlett (LCA 2020)'
recordingDate: 1578975672
description: "Andrew Bartlett\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/140/\n\nAs a developer of Samba's authentication and domain control features since 2001, Andrew Bartlett will ponder how 1980s network authentication technology is faring in Samba and consider the future for on-site authentication and authorization as well as the ever more important cloud/federated identity space. \r\n\r\nThis will in turn inform a bit of crystal ball gazing on where Samba needs to go, to stay relevant, doing more than just being a great AD DC following the protocol pattern from Microsoft.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n#linux.conf.au #linux #foss #opensource\n\nMon Jan 13 11:35:00 2020 at Arena"
