description: "Oracle Data Safe is our newest and fastest growing security service, with something new almost every month. This month the Data Safe team delivers a new feature that many of you have been asking for - information lifecycle management for audit data. Before this latest update, Data Safe was limited to one year of audit data. Now, Data Safe can retain up to 7 years audit data, including both online and archive (offline) data. Join us to learn about the new feature, what the implications are, and how you can use this new feature to meet your audit data retention goals while improving performance for Data Safe reports\n\nWe hold two sessions on the second Wednesday of each month, one at 9:00 am US Central time, the other at 18:00 pm US Central time. Content for both sessions is identical, so just pick whichever works best with your schedule."
