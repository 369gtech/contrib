description: "I've been podcasting for four years and I love making every single episode. I talk to people from around the world about what they love doing, and share this with everyone.\n\nMost people you meet love to talk about topics that interest them and with the right questions they will tell you everything they know.\n\nIn just ten short minutes I'm going to share some of what I've learned about how you can learn from others - how to ask questions, how to listen, how to encourage, when to disagree, when to interrupt and when to stay quiet.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
