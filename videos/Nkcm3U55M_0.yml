description: "Generic Config API: Beyond Cloud, Runtime, and CPI Configs - David Ansari, SAP SE\n\nThis talk starts by demystifying the existing cloud, runtime, and CPI conifg types and revealing weaknesses of their corresponding API endpoints.\n\nWe then present the new generic config API which not only unifies existing configs but, most notably, allows operators to upload any type of config to the BOSH director providing versioning, diffing and branching functionalities out-of-the-box.\n\nFor BOSH operators, these new config types enable unforeseeable uses cases. We present a couple of use cases which are already in the backlog and explain how operators can leverage the functionalities introduced by generic configs. \n\nAbout David Ansari\nDavid works as an open source software developer at SAP. After completing the Pivotal Dojo program in San Francisco he joined the BOSH Openstack CPI team in Walldorf, Germany."
