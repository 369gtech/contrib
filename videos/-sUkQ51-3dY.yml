description: "Developing programs that are inherently immune to attack requires sound software engineering practices. This session looks at the overall software engineering lifecycle and the critical points at which software security is a specific consideration. From the requirements for third-party suppliers to in-house development, your process must offer a level of confidence that the software functions as intended and is free of vulnerabilities. The presentation shows how using threat models, code pattern analysis tooling, targeted reviews, and more enhances Java security.\n\n\nAuthor:\nTim Ellison\nTim Ellison is a senior technical staff member in the Java Technology Centre at IBM Hursley Park.
