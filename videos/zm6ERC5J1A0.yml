description: "Presented by Brad Urani at JSLA (js.la) on Thursday August 27th 2015 - Functional programming is the rage, but you don't need to learn a functional language to get started doing it. In fact, JavaScript has had almost everything you need to program in a purely functional style from the beginning. In this talk, we'll explore the basics of functional programming - higher-order functions, lazy evaluation and immutable persistent data structures. We'll see how a functional style helps you compose logic in a way that's clean, testable and free of certain classes of bugs. Then we'll tie it together into a purely functional style by demonstrating a clever algorithmic game solver.\n\n* twitter.com/bradurani\n* github.com/bradurani"
