The main data type is a set, and an algorithm must be formulated in terms of transformations on these sets, dealing with one element at a time. This is in stark contrast to classical programming languages, which are based on variables, functions, and \ncontrol flow like for loops and conditional statements to process data. \n\nMikio will discuss both approaches and show how to translate a more classical piece of code into the data flow formalism, to be able to benefit from the scalability of these systems. \n\nhttps://flink.apache.org/\nhttp://data-artisans.com/"
