recordingDate: 1521731895
description: 'Big Data - or Data Science - is not only about crunching large amounts of unstructured data, but also about processing, visualizing and browsing data in a timely manner. Vert.x is a polyglott, reactive microservice framework on the JVM. WIth it''s actor like concurrency model and it''s non-blocking I/O processing it is a perfect fit for near-time processing of data streams from various sources. In this talk I''ll discuss and demonstrate approaches for fast & efficient processing and visualization of data from various sources and their use cases implemented with Vert.x.'
