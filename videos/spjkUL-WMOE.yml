title: 'YOW! Nights February 2017 Martin Odersky - From DOT to Dotty'
recordingDate: 1486940064
description: "In this talk Martin Odersky will present some recent developments that pave the way for where Scala is going. The first part covers foundations: We can move confidently ahead only when working on a thoroughly understood basis.\n\n2016 has seen great progress in this respect. Martin presented DOT, a particularly simple calculus that is intended to serve as the foundation of the next version of Scala. Using DOT, he will show that the language core is sound, and can be used to identify unsound features, and develop an intuitive approach to dealing with them.\n\nThe second part is about `dotty`, a new Scala compiler that implements the constructs of DOT in its core data structures and that uses the lessons learned to drive Scala's evolution. He will concentrate in particular on one novel feature - implicit function types, which are a fundamentally new way to abstract over contexts.\n\nMartin Odersky is a professor at EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland. He is best known as the creator of the Scala programming language. Prior to that, he made several contributions to the development of Java. He created the Pizza and GJ languages, designed the original version of generics for Java, and wrote the javac reference compiler.\n\nMore generally, Martin is interested in programing languages and methods, in particular, how object-oriented and functional programming can be made to work seamlessly together. He believes that the two paradigms are two sides of the same coin and should be unified as much as possible.\n\nHe was named an ACM fellow for his achievements in this area.\n\nFor more on YOW!
