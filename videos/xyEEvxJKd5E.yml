description: 'So you’re not crazy, you just want to start your own company. Which kinda takes a level of crazy to pull it off. We’ll talk through what it takes to be an entrepreneur, ideation and the phases of startup, different kinds of companies (service, product, non-profit), how and why (or why not) to raise capital, types of investors, legal requirements, working (or not) with friends, challenges, building total/service addressable market size, back-office administration, employee benefits, equity, pricing, Intellectual Property Rights, economics, and resources for more information and networking. Will include anecdotes and insights of my experiences starting several companies and from multiple founders across the spectrum.'
