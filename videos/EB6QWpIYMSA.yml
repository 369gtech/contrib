description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nRapid Experimentation Simplified with Linkerd - Alexander Simon Jones, DevOps Institute Ambassador\n\nThe cloud engineering team of a multinational financial services corporation used Linkerd to introduce rapid experimentation.\nIt enabled them to create more resilient services and comparatively test changes. In this session, we'll explore how they did it and lessons learned.\nWith the proliferation of microservices architectures, developers need to rapidly set up prod-like dev environments locally.\nFortunately, local Kubernetes clusters to model high-scale, complex architecture within an enterprise are increasingly common.\nThis enables engineers to work with local abstractions of much larger systems.\n\nWithin this paradigm, service meshes also need representation locally as it has intrinsic differences to running a vanilla network layer within Kubernetes.\nTo speed up and ease experimentation, the service mesh must be simple and easy to use. A positive developer experience is key."
