Service Catalog lets you provision cloud services, regardless of where they are hosted, directly from the comfort of native Kubernetes tooling. This works across platforms because we follow the Open Service Broker API, an open standard to provision and manage cloud services. Learn how you can use Service Catalog to access third-party services from your Kubernetes applications. We will walk through provisioning a database directly through Kubernetes and and then connect to it from an application running on the cluster.\n\nTo learn more click here: https://sched.co/FuLO"
