description: "Are you interested in learning how to make your team become smarter and work better together?\nThe concepts of intelligent teams and psychological safety are currently hot topics in the agile world, with numerous blog posts and conference presentations about them appearing. Like most psychological topics, though, they go much deeper than most blog posts and conference presentations would suggest.\nIn this talk, we’ll take a look behind the scenes at the psychological research on team intelligence and psychological safety, exploring not only how they are tested, but also discussing how they can be trained. You’ll learn some simple and fun techniques that you can use to help your team improve. Along the way, we’ll also do some myth-busting on things like 7 plus/minus 2 and the Tuckman model.\n- Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/stretch\n\nStretch Leadership and Management Conference\nstretchcon.com"
