description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2018\n—\nGreg will demonstrate some neat new GDB features and other advanced debugging tools on Linux. \n\nDebugging dominates software development, and yet all too often we rely on printf or at best a little bit of gdb with a bit of 'next' and 'print'. This talk will demonstrate some of the power of newer versions of GDB (Reverse debug, dynamic printf, amazing scriptability possibilities through Python), as well as some of the other Linux debugging tools at your disposal: ftrace, strace, ltrace, valgrind, rr, asan, and lots of very useful stuff in /proc. \n\nThis presentation works either as a stand-alone talk or as a follow on to Greg's popular 'GDB Power User' talk at cppcon 2016.\"\n— \nGreg Law, Undo Limited\nCTO and Co-Founder\n\nGreg is co-founder and CEO at Undo. He is a programmer at heart, but likes to keep one foot in the software world and one in the business world. Greg finds it particularly rewarding to turn innovative software technology into real business development. Greg has over 20 years of experience in both academia and innovative start-up software companies.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
