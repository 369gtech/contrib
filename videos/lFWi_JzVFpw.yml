description: "RubyConfBY 2019 - https://rubyconference.by\n\nVideo Partner – iTechArt https://www.itechart.by \n\nAbout the talk: \nDo you like hacking? For the first time, you will be able to do this during a talk! \n\nIn this talk, Ana will drive the biggest mobprogramming session ever. We all will write code live together to send a PR to an open source Ruby or Rails project. The project we choose, what we implement and the code we write is up to you! More than 200 developers and 45 minutes to select a task, implement it and send a working code upstream may sound impossible. Even if we don't manage, we will learn from each other a ton about open source, git, Ruby and RoR."
