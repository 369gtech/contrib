description: "How the Garden Windows Team Has Made Cloud Foundry the Best Deployment Platform for .NET - Matthew Horan & Natalie Arellano, Pivotal\n\nThe Garden Windows team has been hard at work building first class support for .NET into Cloud Foundry. We'll be providing an update on the new Windows Server 2016 stack, which leverages Windows Server containers. We'll discuss future plans around Cloud Foundry Container Runtime support for Windows, and the shared architecture of Application Runtime and Container Runtime support for Windows.\n\nIn addition to runtime components, the Garden Windows team has been exploring service mesh technologies like Istio, which will greatly benefit .NET developers. Istio enables cross-platform service discovery, failover, and scaling, and is compatible with compatible with Linux, Windows, Container Runtime (Kubernetes) and Application Runtime (Diego). We'll discuss our plans to bring that technology to Cloud Foundry Application Runtime and Container Runtime for Windows.\n\nFinally, we'll discuss some of the work that the .NET Experience team has been working on to bring better support to our Hosted Web Core buildpack. We've been gathering feedback from end users of the buildpack and Application Runtime, and have been working to make the whole .NET experience better for our Cloud Foundry end users. We'll share what we've learned and what's on our roadmap.\n\nhttps://cfseu18.sched.com/event/FRyN/how-the-garden-windows-team-has-made-cloud-foundry-the-best-deployment-platform-for-net-matthew-horan-natalie-arellano-pivotal"
