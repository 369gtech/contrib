description: "This session was presented at EclipseCon 2010, JavaOne 2011, EclipseCon 2012, and JavaOne 2012 as  OSGi for the Earthlings  and has been updated with the integration of Virgo and Gemini. Libra is an open source project under the Eclipse Web Tools Platform Container Project. It provides standard tools for Enterprise OSGi application development, particularly tools that integrate the existing WTP and PDE tooling so that Enterprise OSGi applications can be developed with both toolings at the same time. Libra will also enable users to work with tools for a better experience in the server-side Equinox scenario. Today, with Virgo, Libra offers out-of-the-box simple use of OSGi for regular developers.
