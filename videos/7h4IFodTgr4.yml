recordingDate: 1610129599
description: "Bitcoin just hit an all time high of $33K today. In order to celebrate, lets see if we can install a bitcoin mining client onto my Tesla’s hardware. I don’t know if this is actually possible, but it’s worth it for the educational aspect. Tesla’s are computers on wheels, think of them like you would any other personal computer, except this one is attached to an electric drive train. The vision I have is that someday I can let my Tesla act as a fully autonomous robo-taxi that'll also be earning bitcoin the whole time! It will use its earnings, from both transportation services and bitcoin mining services to pay for its own expenses (repairs, electricity costs, and upgrades) as well as invest them into a diversified portfolio of emerging crypto-community networks. In this episode of my weekly live stream, we’re going to learn a lot about how Bitcoin works, how to install a Bitcoin mining client, and how to create an autonomous trading bot on that same hardware. 3 Wizards will each win $50 BTC for answering my 3 questions related to Bitcoin. Start studying Bitcoin’s functionality and I’ll see you then! \n\nSign up here to answer live questions and compete for the cash prize pool this week:\nhttps://itempool.com/llsourcell/live\n\nCode for this episode:\nhttps://github.com/llsourcell/tesla_bitcoin_miner\n\nSignup for Code Royale to get notified of release on PC/Mac/iOS/Android on Feb 1!
