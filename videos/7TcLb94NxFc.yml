description: 'In this session, we will cover the basics of blockchain and walk through the anatomy of an enterprise blockchain application with special guest Vitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum.  The session will include how to build and manage Quorum infrastructure with the new Azure Blockchain Service, how to use VS Code create and test smart contracts for both consortium networks and public chains and how to interact with both the ledger and smart contracts using new connectors for Logic Apps and Flow. Vitalik will showcase how these tools work well in the public chain as well as private networks running in Azure.  In a demo heavy format, weâ€™ll highlight integrations with both popular Azure services and open source tools, including the just released Confidential Consortium Framework (CCF).'
