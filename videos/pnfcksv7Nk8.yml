description: "Speaker: Sophie Yang\r\n\r\nI built a tool for faster static web loading. This tool parses through html, css, and js files and writes detected dependencies in a resource manifest. This resource manifest help us to benefit from new exciting technology called HTTP/2 Server Push. I will share the tools I used and the concepts (i.e. Abstract Syntax Tree) I learned from this journey.\r\n\r\nAbout Sophie Yang:\r\n\r\n\"I am a 6 months old baby coder. I am in love with and am contributing to the free and open source project called Commons Host.\"\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/Junior-Developers-Singapore/events/252272100/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/kTYk/"
