title: '"Securing Container Runtimes -- How Hard Can It Be?" - Aleksa Sarai (LCA 2020)'
recordingDate: 1579132574
description: "Aleksa Sarai\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/62/\n\nIn the past few years, we have seen a varied array of different security vulnerabilities in container runtimes (often resulting in breakouts or other severe attacks against the host system). As a result, some members of the community have been looking into whether there are more fundamental issues at play which could help resolve some of these problems. In this talk, we will discuss what are possible problem areas for container runtime security and our attempts to solve some of these issues through both kernel-space and user-space protections -- and how some of these protections may help many other programs outside the container runtime community secure themselves against attackers.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
