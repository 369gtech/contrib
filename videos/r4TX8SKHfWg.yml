description: "Building an Effective Feedback Loop for Your Privacy Program through Privacy Incident Response\n\nSri Pravallika Maddipati\n\nPrivacy Incident Response (PIR) can be challenging to most organizations given the growing number of regulations and notification obligations. While most of the focus is on timely response to incidents, breach notification and quick fixes to minimize damage, the communication of lessons learnt to the appropriate product and privacy teams is often ignored.
