description: 'In this talk I will show you how to build a CI/CD pipeline in AWS with, static code analysis in Sonar, tests and continuous deployment of a dockerized service through several environments by using pure AWS services like CodeStar, CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy and CodePipline. I will do a demo of such CI/CD to reveal all guts of tools and services integration and implementation.
