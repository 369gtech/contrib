description: "Google Tech Talk\r\nOctober 22, 2009\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nPresented by Doron Reuveni, CEO & Co-Founder of uTest, at the 4th Annual Google Test Automation Conference, October 21st, 22nd, 2009, Zurich, CH\r\n\r\nIn the highly competitive world of mobile applications, getting high-quality apps to market quickly can make or break the success of a product. With new applications for Android, iPhone and Blackberry battling for media attention and consumer dollars, the pressure to get apps built, tested and launched has never been greater. But the testing methods that have worked for web and desktop app companies (in-house QA, offshore testing firms, emulators/simulators, beta testers, etc.) dont meet the QA needs of mobile apps. The testing matrices in the mobile app world have become far too complex. Companies must test their apps across handset makers, handset models, wireless carriers, OS and browsers.  And beyond that, they MUST account for location-based testing  a task that has proven difficult and prohibitively expensive for even the most mature and sophisticated teams. This unmet challenge calls for a new approach. Crowdsourcing is uniquely suited to meet this challenge. By tapping into the diverse crowd of testers who operate outside the lab environment, companies can build a virtual testing team who meets their coverage requirements. This session will examine the growing trend of crowd sourced testing for mobile applications, as well as addressing the benefits & challenges of this model, compared with conventional testing options.  In this session, Doron Reuveni will address:Alternative Testing Methods and Why They Fall Short of Meeting Mobiles In-The-Wild Testing Demands:In-House Testing Outsourcing/Offshoring Emulators/Simulators Beta Testers The Crowd sourcing Option: Building an On-Demand Testing Team The Complimentary Role a Community Plays in Mobile Testing Crowd sourcing Challenges: Maximizing Quality, Achieving Coverage, Crowd Control Real-World Case of a Company Utilizing Crowds to Test & Launch Mobile Apps \r\n \r\nBio: Doron Reuveni co-founded uTest in February, 2007. Since its inception, uTest has provided functional and usability testing services through a community of QA professionals that includes 20,000+ testers from 157 countries around the globe.
