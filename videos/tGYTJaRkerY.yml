description: 'These days everyone talks about company’s culture as a most important thing to consider for any transformation, especially Agile one. But what if your company has multiple locations spread geographically? That means you have different cultures in-house by definition. Add here frequent acquisitions and rapid growth, and you will get a mix that sometimes is contradicting by its nature. What is so different, how to deal with it, could Agile have a chance to survive and become the common denominator, what are the key points to consider – this is what this talk is about.'
