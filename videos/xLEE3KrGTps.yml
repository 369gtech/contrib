description: "21st century problems cannot be solved with 20th century software architectures. So why is the starting point for so many projects built on the assumption of a simplistic monolithic, three-layer architecture sat on top of a RDBMS? Hardware has progressed. It has changed many of the assumptions that such architectures were built upon. Modern systems are distributed, deal with massive throughput of data and transactions. Users expect 24/7 service.\n\nThe Reactive Manifesto describes what it takes to build systems that meet these demands. Such systems are Responsive, Resilient, Elastic and Message Driven. What does this mean in terms of software architecture and design? This presentation will introduce these ideas and describe how systems built on these principles work.\n\nDave Farley is a thought-leader in the field of Continuous Delivery, DevOps and Software Development in general. He is co-author of the Jolt-award winning book ‘Continuous Delivery’ a regular conference speaker and blogger and one of the authors of the Reactive Manifesto.\n\nDave has been having fun with computers for over 35 years has worked on most types of software, from firmware, through tinkering with operating systems and device drivers, to writing games, and commercial applications of all shapes and sizes. He started working in large scale distributed systems about 25 years ago, doing research into the development of loose-coupled, message-based systems – a forerunner of MicroService architectures.\n\nDave has a wide range of experience leading the development of complex software in teams, both large and small, in the UK and USA. Dave was an early adopter of agile development techniques, employing iterative development, continuous integration and significant levels of automated testing on commercial projects from the early 1990s.\n\nDave is the former Head of Software development at LMAX Ltd, home of the OSS Disruptor, a company that are well known for the excellence of their code and the exemplary nature of their development process.\n\nDave is now an independent software developer and consultant, and founder and director of Continuous Delivery Ltd.\n\nFor more on YOW! conferences, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
