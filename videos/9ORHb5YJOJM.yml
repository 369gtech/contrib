description: "Speaker: Surya Dharma Tio (DevOps Lead, Mohammad Aslam (DevOps Engineer) \n\nWhen talking about companies that deploy their applications to production several times a day, we always hear of the same Silicon Valley examples: Google, Netflix, Facebook...\n\nWe're glad to have a few companies in Singapore that are doing it just as well. RedMart has moved to Continuous Delivery and a full micro-services architecture a few years ago. \n\n\nSurya Dharma Tio (DevOps Lead) and Mohammad Aslam (DevOps Engineer) will walk you through the entire CI/CD pipeline at RedMart, from idea to production rollout.\n\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/singajug/events/237446113/\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/5Vqw/"
