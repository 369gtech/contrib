Rook is an open source cloud-native storage orchestrator for Kubernetes, providing the platform, framework, and support for a diverse set of storage solutions to natively integrate with cloud-native environments. Rook turns storage software into self-managing, self-scaling, and self-healing storage services. It does this by automating deployment, bootstrapping, configuration, provisioning, scaling, upgrading, migration, disaster recovery, monitoring, and resource management. We will explore the benefits and use cases of Rook, and we will also walk through the architecture that the project is built on. Rook was accepted as the first storage project hosted by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) in January 2018.\n\nTo learn more click here: https://sched.co/FuLF"
