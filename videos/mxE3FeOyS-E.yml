description: "Google Tech Talks\nMay, 23 2008\n\nABSTRACT\n\nOverview: Mark Birbeck has spent a number of years working on flexible user interfaces, both by developing software and working with the W3C on new standards. His latest work involves creating an Ajax framework\nthat uses metadata embedded in HTML documents to drive dynamic user interfaces. The framework makes it easy for authors to build interactive sites, whilst still creating accessible, searchable documents.\n\nIn this talk Mark will look at how embedded metadata can be used by anyone from scientific researchers to bloggers, through news organisations to photographers, to improve how their pages are understand and interacted with.\n\nSpeaker: Mark Birbeck \nMark Birbeck devised RDFa, a new standard from the W3C that allows metadata to be embedded in HTML and XHTML documents, rather than being stored separately. Web pages enriched in this way provide more accurate information for use in search engines, as well as creating enormous potential for building a new generation of\ninteractive tools for the end-user. Mark is also involved in the XForms Working Group and the XHTML 2 Working Group, has contributed to books on XML and RDF, blogs regularly about XForms, the semantic web,\nand RIAs, and his company, webBackplane develops a range of open source software for semantic-driven user interfaces.
