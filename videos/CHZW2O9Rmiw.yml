title: 'Functional web applications using F# and suave - Thomas Jansson'
recordingDate: 1470654620
description: "The web is functional, so why not write web applications in a functional language? Suave is a lightweight, non-blocking web server implemented in and for F#. To get a web application up and running you only need a couple of lines of code compared to multiple classes and tons of boiler plate code in a standard .NET web application. The building blocks in suave are really small, and making custom ones is easy. You can chain the building blocks together forming one application using one simple operator. Suave also comes with features like typed routing for better safety, sockets, basic authentication and more.\nThis talk will show you how to get started with suave on Windows or Linux and create a 100 % functional web application."
