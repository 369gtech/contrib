title: 'Learn to build fullstack React apps with Blitz.js'
recordingDate: 1602107129
description: "Our #WednesdayStreams return in October with a look at some new tools for building full stack JavaScript apps!\n\nIn September we built a \"Tag Journal\" habit tracking app with Laravel. This month we're going to build a similar app using the full-stack React framework Blitz.js. (https://blitzjs.com)\n\nIn this first stream (Part 1 of ... 4?) we'll look at some of the open source tools Blitz.js brings together: Next.js, Prisma 2 and React Query. We'll try to understand how they work separately, by building a simple project so that next week we can see how Blitz.js builds on top of these existing tools.\n\nIf there's time, we'll also deploy our demo app to Vercel.\n\nSoftware and services:\nhttps://blitzjs.com\nhttps://nextjs.com\nhttps://prisma.io\nhttps://react-query.tanstack.com/\nhttps://vercel.com\nhttps://digitalocean.com\n\nOrder of events:\n2:02 Video intro after live stream introduction\n9:03 Kick off a new Next.js project from scratch\n26:54 API Routes in Next.js\n30:47 Set up Prisma 2 and some basic data models\n56:06 Fetching data from API routes\n1:00:24 Intro to React Query\n1:13:32 React Query dev tools\n1:20:23 Deploy the project to Vercel with the Github integration\n1:22:36 Create Digital Ocean Postgres Database\n1:23:32 App deployment successful, waiting for db...\n1:30:27 Database is up!\n1:31:49 Vercel overview, setting up database connection Environment variable\n1:49:10 It works!\n1:49:30 Slow network round trips to San Francisco\n1:51:24 One single Vercel config to make it much faster\n1:55:44 Outro, thanks!\n1:56:31 Post outro Prisma examples\n1:57:41 End\n\nNorfolk Developers Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/NorfolkDev\nShaun on twitter: https://twitter.com/shaunchurch"
