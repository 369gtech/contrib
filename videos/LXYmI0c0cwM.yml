title: 'BDD Anonymous, a testers addiction | Vernon Richards | CukenFest London 2017'

description: "I’m a tester by trade, and whenever I find anything that helps make software development easier, I’m interested. Over the years, I’ve always felt as though testers were BDDs biggest supporters and we often persuade teams to give it a try. But, lately, I have found myself asking “Can we be too successful at this?” I have seen teams become addicted to feature files. No matter the context or the mission, the creation of feature files seems to be the way to go. Why are we so easily seduced by this? What are the dangers? What can we introduce to encourage moderation and a sense of appropriate response to team needs? I’d like to explore and play around with why this happens and how we might be able to break our addiction!\n\nA software tester with 10 years experience testing products developed in various technologies/languages using Agile (Scrum) and Lean (Kanban), v-model & waterfall methodologies."
