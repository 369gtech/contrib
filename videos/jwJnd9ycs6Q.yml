description: 'In this live coding session, we will refactor a part of some legacy system. We will approach the problem pragmatically, identifying issues and fixing them by applying rules and patterns related to modularity, cohesion, testability, and more. We will also see how Domain Driven Design can help us achieve the goal of clean and solid code.'
