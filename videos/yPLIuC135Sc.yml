description: "Speaker: Leonard Loo (https://www.linkedin.com/in/leonardloo)\r\n\r\nSynopsis:\r\n\r\nform.sg is a form builder tool for government to self-service and create online forms that capture classified data, with the goal of replacing paper forms. It does so while working around and sometimes taking advantage of the government infrastructure that is currently in place, with a lean team. In this talk, we outline the motivations for building form.sg, the challenges that were encountered in doing so, the product decisions made to meet those challenges, and what lies ahead for government forms in Singapore.\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/ProductTank-Singapore/events/255955192/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\r\nRecorded by: Michael Cheng"
