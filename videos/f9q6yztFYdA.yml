description: "by Philip Durbin\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/H.2215/dataverse.webm\n\nDataverse is open source research data repository software installed by 52 institutions around the world and translated into ten languages. It facilitates data sharing, allowing researchers to replicate and build upon each other's work and receive academic credit in the form of citations for publishing data. Data deposited into Dataverse installations is made more discoverable through harvesting of metadata via standard protocols, publication to registries such as DataCite, and indexing into scholarly search engines such as Google Dataset Search. Data exploration is enabled by a variety tools contributed by the international Dataverse community that make use of Dataverse APIs to get data in and out. These APIs also enable a variety of integrations with scholarly publishing systems such as electronic lab notebooks, journal systems, reproducibility platforms, and more. In this talk a core developer for Dataverse will introduce the audience to the world of scholarly publishing, making the case for data publication and how it contributes to the advancement of science. An emphasis will be made on how Dataverse goes beyond simply being open source by being friendly to contributions from newcomers.\n\nRoom: H.2215 (Ferrer)\nScheduled start: 2020-02-02 13:00:00"
