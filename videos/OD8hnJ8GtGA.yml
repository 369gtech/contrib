language: English
recordingDate: 1639090900
description: "Transforming Innovative Security Concepts into Disruptive Security Companies\n\nRick Gordon, Managing Partner, Mach37 Cyber Accelerator\n\nSecurity operations people worldwide continue to be overwhelmed by global malicious actors who enjoy an asymmetric advantage. In order to level the playing field, innovators continually create new capabilities that enable them to secure their information infrastructures more scalably and efficiently. Often times, these innovations can solve the same or similar problems in many other enterprises—representing an attractive business opportunity by addressing a large unmet need.\n\nHowever, inserting these innovations into existing market ecosystems is significantly more challenging than simply packaging together a few lines of code and selling them. Rather, these technical innovators must often transform themselves into business leaders that embody marketing, finance and product management skill sets for which they may have had little or no formal training.\n\nThis talk will describe that transformation as technology-focused entrepreneurs with disruptive concepts can build companies that can attract the talent, capital, and customers required for their innovations to reach their intended markets.\n\nRick Gordon is an expert on security technology investing, business strategy and early-stage venture development. Rick currently serves as Managing Partner of Mach37™, the premier accelerator for cybersecurity entrepreneurs and startups. MACH37 launches companies that are delivering the next generation of cybersecurity solutions.\n\nPrior to this role, Rick served as Vice President of Product Management at KEYW Corporation, COO of Lookingglass Cyber Solutions, Managing Director at The Civitas Group, CEO of Tovaris, and was a founding board member of Invincea.\n\nView the full USENIX Security '15 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity15/technical-sessions"
