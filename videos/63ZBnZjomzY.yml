title: 'DrupalCon Vienna 2017: Community is shared values.'
recordingDate: 1506604475
description: "Removing assumptions and crafting a Statement of Values as a path towards clarity of mission and practice in community governance.\n\nOur current Code of Conduct is a mix of idealism and practice. If we are to be a community based on values, or principles, or ideals–and maybe we’re not–we need to say so. We need to discover what those values are and express them in actionable, ways. A Statement of Values would give us an instance, something concrete to reference when we talk about the “who we are” part of Drupal.\n\nWith that in hand, we’d have a powerful tool to help us create a separate, new Code of Conduct (and/or structures, procedures, rules, documentation) based on those values expressed in the Statement of Values. This new CoC (or whathaveyou) could help us to act predictably, consistently, and in accordance with our agreed values.\n\nI recently conducted a survey of our community to get an idea of what our shared values and priorities might be. In this session, I present results and insights I gained from the hundreds of answers the survey’s respondents provided and use them to propose the outlines of a Statement of Values and a way forward towards a clearer community identity."
