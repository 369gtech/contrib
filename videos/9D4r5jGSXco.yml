description: "Lessons Learnt Operating Multiple Cloud Foundry on OpenStack Deployments - Tyler Britten, IBM\n\nAccording to OpenStack users survey, Cloud Foundry is the 2nd most popular workload on OpenStack. You want to deploy Cloud Foundry on OpenStack or already have. What's next?\n\nCloud Foundry continues to evolve, often with revolutionary changes, e.g move from bosh-micro to bosh-init, using the new eCPI, move to Diego etc. Same with OpenStack, e.g changes from Keystone v2 to v3, from Kilo to Mitaka, network plugins changes etc. Both IaaS and PaaS layers are changing frequently.\n\nIn this talk will discuss our lessons learnt operating hybrid Cloud Foundry deployments on top of OpenStack over the last years. We will discuss how we have used underlying technologies like BOSH, Ansible, Jenkins, Razor, Rally etc to seamlessly operate Cloud Foundry on OpenStack. We will also detail community tools to validate whether Cloud Foundry deployment will work on your OpenStack etc."
