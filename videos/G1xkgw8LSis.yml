description: "When you run your C++ code, have you ever considered how the linker, loader, operating system, C and C++ runtime all work so hard to get everything set up for you to start running your code in main()? \n\nIn this Linux-focused talk, Matt will talk about how the linker stitches together your code and how that fits in with dynamic linking. He'll touch on debugging issues with the loader, and how ODR violations can manifest themselves. Then he'll take a look at what's going on behind the scenes to get the C runtime up, and then the C++ runtime, along with all the global object constructors - showing more reasons why you shouldn't be using them! \n\nBy the end of the talk you should have an understanding of how a bundle of object files are brought together by the linker, along with the relevant runtimes, and then loaded and executed by the operating system.\n\nEVENT:\n\nCppCon 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nMatt Godbolt\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nCppCon Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video."
