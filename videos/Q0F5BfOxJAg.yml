description: "Demystifying Machine Learning in Production: Reasoning about a Large-Scale ML Platform\n\nMary McGlohon, Google\n\nMachine Learning is often treated as mysterious or unknowable. This can lead to SREs choosing to work around ML-related reliability problems in their systems rather than through them. This avoidance is not only risky but also unnecessary: Any given SRE operates with systems that they themselves may not know in great depth. To manage risk, they use a series of generalized techniques to understand the properties of the system and its failure modes.\n\nIn this talk, we apply this outside-in approach towards ML reliability, drawing from experiences with a large-scale ML production platform. We describe common failure modes (spoiler alert: they tend to be the same things that happen in other large systems), and based on these failure modes, recommend best practices for productionization: Monitor systems and protect them from human error. Understand data integrity needs, and meet them. Prioritize pipeline workloads for efficiency and backlog recovery.\n\nView the full SREcon21 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon21/program"
