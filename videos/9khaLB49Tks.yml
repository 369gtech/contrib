description: "Bosh Vault: Secretless Bosh Manifests and Vault - Matt Surabian, Zipcar \n\nCloudFoundry's config server API has changed the way we're able to manage our infrastructure's secrets by limiting the amount of information our Bosh director needs to remember. Even though the config server API was designed as a generic abstraction, Credhub was the only secure implementation of it.   At Zipcar we were already invested in Vault and didn't want to have to manage two secret storage solutions, so we decided to write a config server implementation that was able to use Vault as a backend. This talk introduces the bosh-vault open source project, explores working with config servers and Bosh in general, and talks about the awesome community support that made this experiment possible. \n\nFor more info: https://www.cloudfoundry.org/"
