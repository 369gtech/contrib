description: "Session from the 'Agile Riga Day 2012' conferenece.\n\nToday, when good developers are as hard to find as honest politicians, we — the development teams — run the show. But increasingly, we're losing touch with the very thing that allows us to be successful.\n\nWe're forgetting about how to make our (development) clients happy. More fundamentally, this means that we're losing touch with the end goal: to build products that have a high value, regardless of how they're developed.\n\nIn this session i'll show you modern agile methodology called BDD and couple of accompanied tools, that will finally help you on the way to make well thought products.\n\nWebsite: http://www.agilerigaday.lv/Sessions/using-bdd-to-make-clients-happy"
