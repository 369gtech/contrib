language: English
recordingDate: 1433246562
description: "As in almost any other part of Java, the security area for web applications offers a huge number of different-size libraries and tools that all promise to make the life of a developer much easier. However, their sheer number raises the question of which libraries are used best at which time and which tools optimally support the secure development of a web application. This session introduces seven different security tools and libraries (frameworks) that support developers who are developing secure Java-based web applications. These libraries solve common and widespread security problems in web applications, and these tools assist developers and make it easier to preserve the achieved level of security in the web application.\n\n\nAuthor:\nDominik Schadow\nDominik Schadow has more than 10 years of experience in Java development and is working as a senior consultant at bridgingIT in Stuttgart, Germany.
