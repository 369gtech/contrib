title: 'Simplifying Production Machine Learning with MLflow - Daniel Haviv'
recordingDate: 1582014083
description: "Bringing a machine learning project to a successful conclusion is more difficult than it may seem initially. We have to take into consideration the full machine learning lifecycle, which allows us to focus not only on the development of the model, but also on production and monitoring. Thankfully, there are mature tools available to manage the machine learning lifecycle. One of the tools for end-to-end machine learning lifecycle management is the open-source platform MLflow.\n\nDuring this session Daniel deep dives into main MLflow components:\n- MLflow tracking: using an API and UI to track/log/visualize machine learning experiments.\n- MLflow projects: using standardized format to package reusable data science code.\n- MLflow models: using provided tools to deploy common model types to diverse platforms."
