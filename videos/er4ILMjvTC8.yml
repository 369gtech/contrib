title: 'Jendrik Joerdening and Anthony Navarro on Self-Racing Cars Using Deep Neural Networks'
language: English
recordingDate: 1521531068
description: "The podcast with show notes is available on InfoQ:  http://bit.ly/2FQA9sc \n\nCase Study: Last year a team of 18 Udacity Self-Driving Cars students (with limited experience leveraging deep learning) designed, implemented, and ultimately raced an autonomous control system for a self driving car. \nWes Reisz talked to Jendrik Joerdening and Anthony Navarro about the race, the preparation, and what it looked like testing and iterating with a multitude of models. Topics covered on this podcast include: building/modify their simulator, behavior cloning, Convolutional Neural Network, platform architecture, segmentation network, and more.\n\nFor more awesome podcasts check InfoQâ€™s selection: http://bit.ly/2zFu2PN"
