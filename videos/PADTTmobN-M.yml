title: 'Be a Kubernetes master without ever leaving your code, debugger, and IntelliJ - Ivan Portyankin'
language: English
recordingDate: 1564568110
description: "Video from Devoxx Poland 2019.\n\nGo from zero to a deployed and running Java Cloud Native application with Google Cloud / Kubernetes Tools for IntelliJ and Java (all other major languages and JetBrains IDEs are supported too). We will quickly convert plain Java application into full-blown Kubernetes one barely touching CLI and YAMLs, then live debug the newly deployed application on Kubernetes without making any configuration changes.\n\nWe will then fix a bug (or add a feature) in the running application which will automatically redeploy.\n\nThis talk intends to make the audience see how easy it could be to develop and iterate on a Kubernetes application when using any Kubernetes cluster and a new IntelliJ IDE plugin from Google.\n\nThe developers can forget about the tedious Kubernetes deployment process and just focus on what they care about - their code."
