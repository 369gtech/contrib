recordingDate: 1469391731
description: "This episode of Fresh Machine Learning is about generating rap lyrics! Lyrical generation is possible using either Hidden Markov Models or deep learning. In this episode, I go through a few past examples of what's been done before, then dive into our own example that we can code in Python. Welcome to the machine MC revolution!\n\nThe demo code for this video can be found here:\n\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/Rap_Lyric_Generator\n\nI created a Slack channel for us, sign up here:\nhttps://wizards.herokuapp.com/\n\nTry it out live here:\n\nhttp://deepbeat.org/\n\nI introduce three papers in this video\n\nUnsupervised Rhyme Scheme Identification in Hip Hop Lyrics Using Hidden Markov Models:\n\nhttp://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-39593-2_3\n\nModeling Hip Hop Challenge-Response Lyrics as Machine Translation:\n\nhttp://www.illc.uva.nl/LaCo/CLS/papers/wu_hiphop_itg.pdf\n\nDopeLearning: A Computational Approach to Rap Lyrics Generation:\n\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04771\n\nMore info about Hidden Markov Models:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPRoLreU9lA\n\nhttps://www.quora.com/What-is-a-simple-explanation-of-the-Hidden-Markov-Model-algorithm\n\nhttp://www.developerstation.org/2011/11/hidden-markov-models-for-dummies.html\n\nI love you guys! Thanks for watching my videos, I do it for you. I left my awesome job at Twilio and I'm doing this full time now. \n\nI recently created a Patreon page. If you like my videos, feel free to help support my effort here!:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/user?ty=h&u=3191693\n\nMuch more to come so please subscribe, like, and comment.\nFollow me:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/sirajraval\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/sirajology Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/sirajraval/ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/sirajraval/"
