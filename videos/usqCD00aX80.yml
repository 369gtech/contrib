We have to do our best to include everyone from a diverse background as speakers and learn from their experiences. This panel discussion features established speakers with diverse backgrounds and will inspire you to start your own public speaking career. We will talk about topics like the impostor syndrome, stage fright, topic selection, and will have an extensive Q&A to answer anything you are wondering about public speaking.\n\n\n\nPanel participants: \n\nArmagan Amcalar\nHead of Software Engineering - Wayfair\n\nArmagan is currently working as a Senior Engineering Manager at Wayfair, responsible for leading the creation of innovative products to enhance the experiences of Wayfair's partners.
