There are a lot of options to choose from, between Java EE, what is now Jakarta EE, MicroProfile, and combinations of their APIs. If we look at available application containers the number of possibilities are even higher. Which platforms, particular standards and runtimes should enterprise developers base their applications on in year 2018?\n\nThis session shows the difference between Java EE, Jakarta EE, MicroProfile and their individual specifications. We’ll how their APIs complement each other and enable us to develop applications with focus on high productivity using well-known APIs Especially cloud native applications require a few additional technical concerns, such as telemetry and resiliency that are added by the recent MicroProfile specifications. We will also see a comparison of Java Enterprise runtimes, which containers support MicroProfile, which deployment models are there, and what choice makes sense for different technology stacks.\n\nSebastian Daschner \nFrom Sebastian Daschner - IT-Beratung\nSebastian Daschner is a self-employed Java consultant, author and trainer and is enthusiastic about programming and Java (EE).
