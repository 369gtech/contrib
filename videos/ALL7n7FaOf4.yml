description: "Chaos Engineering is the discipline of experimenting on a distributed system in order to build confidence in the system’s capability to withstand turbulent conditions in production (definition by http://principlesofchaos.org).\n\nIn this talk we explore the basics of Chaos Engineering. We take a look at an system design that supports conducting chaos experiments and then we dive into some more low level approaches to injecting faults into a system under test.\n\nFirst we focus on modelling a Chaos Engineering system using a functional language like Elixir. We discuss how chaos experiments and fault injections are mapped in this language. Later on, we look at the techniques to implement chaos orchestration - i.e. how to inject actual faults into a running distributed system. Finally we briefly go over ideas on how to disrupt a running Elixir node. This section explores actual Elixir code that would be injected during a chaos experiment to trigger faults in the node.\n\nThe examples in the presentation correspond to a real Chaos Engineering platform that is being developed and used at Erlang Solutions.\n\nMore details on website here: http://www.elixirconf.eu/elixirconfeu2018/szymon-mentel"
