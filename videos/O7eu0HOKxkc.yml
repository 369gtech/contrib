description: "The Internet is no longer a toy we play with, it’s where we live. In it we have new problems and old problems amplified. The new problems include mis- and disinformation, tracking through metadata, the effects of the attention and surveillance economies, to outright betrayals of trust from our ISPs and other providers. Old problems like flaming, abuse, and rudeness which in the wrong places have lead to violence and genocide. Even one of the best things about the Internet, helping communities of people who might never meet, allows communities of bad people to form as much as good ones. Today’s problems are bad enough that we often think it’s as if our house is filled with roaches.\n\nThese problems are also the excuse for calls for more surveillance everywhere and newest global Crypto Wars. Governments that want to spy are using these problems as their excuse for fighting against encryption. They say that bulldozing the house will fix the problem. They’re wrong about the solution, while right that the problems are real and worth solving.\n\nThis talk will look at these very real problems and how hackers, security people, and others can work to mitigate our quandary. It isn’t easy, there’s no silver bullet, and that’s why we should give it our attention. We hackers have skills the world needs.\n\n=== \n\nJon Callas is a cryptographer, software engineer, UX designer, and entrepreneur. He was most recently at Apple, where he helped design the encryption system to protect data stored on a Mac. Jon also worked on security, UX, and crypto for Kroll-O’Gara, Counterpane, and Entrust. He has launched or worked on the launches of many tools designed to encrypt and secure personal data, including PGP, Silent Circle, Blackphone, DKIM, ZRTP, Skein, and Threefish. Jon is also a tireless advocate within the tech companies he has worked for, in Internet standards bodies, in the press, in public speaking, and in government advocacy for secure and confidential communications. He is fond of Leica cameras, Morgan sports cars, and Birman cats. His photographs have been used by Wired, CBS News, and The Guggenheim Museum."
