description: "PyData NYC 2018\n\nApproaching data science as a graph theorist can yield surprisingly effective results. However, the the graph theory jargon can make graph analytics seem more intimidating for self-study than is necessary. In this talk, the audience will be exposed to some of the basic concepts of graph theory (no prerequisite math knowledge needed!) and a few of the Python tools available for graph analysis.\n\nSlides - https://www.slideshare.net/PyData/graph-analytics-from-the-whiteboard-to-your-toolbox-sam-lerma\n===\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
