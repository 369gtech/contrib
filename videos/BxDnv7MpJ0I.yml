description: "Intro + Deep Dive: Kubernetes (Network) SIG - Tim Hockin, Google \n\nThis presentation will include an introduction to Kubernetes networking, covering the high level challenges the Kubernetes network model solves, Kubernetes specific concepts such as Services, Ingress, and NetworkPolicy, and how they interact and are typically used. We'll then dive deeper into topics currently being discussed in SIG network, opening the floor for discussion and debate on a range of topics based on attendee interest and moderated by members of the SIG. In this latter half, we hope to bring contributors and users together to discuss the problems they are currently facing and how we can collaborate to solve them. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPky"
