description: "Nowadays, most of the time in Data Science projects are not spent in performing analytics but in other tasks, such as organizing data sources, collecting samples and preparing datasets, compiling and validating business rules in data, etc. This fact has been studied as the \"80/20 dilemma in Data Science projects\", and its treatment is important to have better management of time and resources, especially in real-life projects that demand results in a short time frame. In this talk, we will present the main problems involved and exhibit some cases worked at Fligoo and technologies implemented to deal with this dilemma, then some current trends will be mentioned in order to optimize the effort in these projects. This presentation is intended for every data scientist, data engineer and project manager who may be interested in learning some tips and methodologies to tackle this issue.\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
