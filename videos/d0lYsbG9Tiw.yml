description: "Hate it or love it, the iframe is one of the most dynamic elements in the current html spec. All the popular websites will contain a few of them as they are used by the advertisement industry. But that's not its only purpose. Iframes have a wide variety of use cases and implementations. From form targets to sandboxes to websites-in-a-website to seamless pseudo-element to parallel processing to unblocked preloading to clickjacking. In my talk we'll dive deeper into what it's like to be an iframe. We'll look at what the spec has to say about them and how they are used in the wild. We'll try to figure out where the tag came from, where it is now, and what makes it so unique.\n\nSlides: https://qfox.github.io/htmlday16/htmlday2016.final.pdf\nExperiments: https://github.com/qfox/htmlday16\nAbout Peter: http://qfox.nl/about\n\nMore about CSS Day: http://cssday.nl or https://twitter.com/cssdayconf\nReceive conference announcements in your inbox: http://cssday.nl/subscribe"
