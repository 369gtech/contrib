description: "Streams, batches, and microservices. Oh My! Data integration and related workloads are at the foundation of all enterprise workloads. They ingest streams of events. They process large batches. How do we develop applications to address these kind of workloads while taking advantage of modern cloud infrastructure to deploy and monitor them?\n\nWhile Radio Shack may have left us, their slogan of \"You've got questions, we've got answers\" is the theme for the day. Bring your questions about these workloads and let's chat. No slides, no demos, no pitches. Just good, honest conversation between devs.\n\n===\n\nMichael Minella is a software engineer, Java Champion, speaker, & author with over 18 years of enterprise development experience. He has been a member of the Spring R&D team as the project lead for the Spring Batch & founder of the Spring Cloud Task projects for over 7 years. Michael has spoken on a number of Java, Spring, & Big Data topics & is a JavaOne Rockstar.
