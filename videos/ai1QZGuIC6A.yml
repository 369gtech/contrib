title: 'Incremental Bayesian Networks for Natural Language Parsing'
recordingDate: 1191899522
description: "Google Tech Talks\nAugust 13, 2007\n\nABSTRACT\n\nNatural language parsing is a particularly challenging structure prediction problem, due to the large space of output structures and the complex nature of the statistical dependencies between features of the output structures. Typically these statistical dependencies are specified by hand, but recently there has been interest in using latent variables to induce them automatically. In this talk I will present a framework for structure prediction with latent variables based on a form of Dynamic Bayesian Network called Incremental Sigmoid Belief Networks (ISBNs), and illustrate how it can be applied to parsing. Approximations to ISBNs have achieved..."
