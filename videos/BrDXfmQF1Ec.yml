description: 'Current status quo of credential management in cloud related DEVOPS environments enables attackers to easily obtain leaked credentials. This presentation showcases how leaked credentials in public repositories can potentially lead to further compromise in enterprise environments.The focus will be on the DEVOPS attack surface and the toolchains involved within this process in cloud platform environments. Presenters will use a recently released tool (Git Wild Hunt) to show how public leaks can lead to further compromise of individuals and enterprises with actual examples of derived information from compromised secrets. An analysis of credentials leaked globally and its source (company affected and user) will be provided as examples.'
