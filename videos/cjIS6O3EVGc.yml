description: "In this talk, I will introduce the audience to Julia and show you how seamless it is to start programing in Julia from a Python background. I will talk about my experience using Julia in a few different projects and why Iâ€™ve found Julia an accessible yet special language with a lot of potential. I will also share what I love about the Julia community.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
