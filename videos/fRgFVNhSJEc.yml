title: 'NDC 2018   Dag 2   Sesjon 5   Sal 4Deconstructing TypeScript’s Type System - Spencer Schneidenbach'
recordingDate: 1533563937
description: "TypeScript isn’t just a strongly-typed replacement for JavaScript – it’s a full language with lots of modern features, including a cutting-edge type system. This awesome type system is often overlooked in favor of other features such as decorators and async/await, but is in fact one of the best reasons to use TypeScript.\nIn this session, Spencer will discuss the advanced type features of TypeScript, including intersection types, type guards, nullable types, type aliases, string literals, and discriminated unions. We’ll also discuss ways to take full advantage of TypeScript’s compile-time checking to ensure your code is clean and safe."
