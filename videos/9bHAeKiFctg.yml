description: "Liron Amitzi, Senior Database Consultant, Brillix LTD\n\nIn 20 years of SQL tuning, this session’s speaker has learned many things. The number of elements that affect query tuning is huge: tables’ structure, indexes, optimizer behavior, and the SQL text itself are only some of them. This session takes a deep dive into specific examples of SQL tuning, based on real-life experience. Together, he and the audience members will identify a problem, analyze it (from understanding the schema and the application logic to looking at the object structure and SQL text), and fix it, while learning techniques and gaining some best practices for performance tuning."
