description: "The way we build software has taken a huge paradigm shift in the last few years. The applications/services that are developed in the cloud era have to be intrinsically reliable, resilient to failure (at the hardware/network/app level), highly available, and scalable. Though there are some general guidelines, key design factors for building cloud-native app/services is still both art and science.\n\nIn this talk, I'd like to present some key insights I've learned as a Lead Platform engineer to the same old problem(s) to building apps in a distributed environment.\n\nSpeakers: Dilleswara Anupoju, Lead Platform Engineer, Comcast\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2019\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/monoliths-microservices-events-functions-what-it-takes-to-go-through-the-transformation"
