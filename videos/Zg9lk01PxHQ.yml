description: "Data Binding: what is it, what it’s made of, and finally - how does it work?\n\nDifferent frameworks use “two ways data-binding” now: Angular, Knockout, Ember, Polimer, etc. Any of them has its' pros and cons.  While one approach gives you better performance, it also comes with uncomfortable coding practice, and vice versa. So how do you choose your way?\n\nThings we are going to do on the workshop:\n•  We will overview how Data Binding works inside. \n• We will implement fastest “two way binding” based on the new possibilities of ECMA Script 5 and 6 as an example.\nKnowing this you can use Data Binding in your projects better."
