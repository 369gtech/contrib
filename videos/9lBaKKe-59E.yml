title: 'Tanzu Tuesdays - Using Knative Eventing for Better Observability with Tyler Britten'
language: English
recordingDate: 1610565485
description: "If you’re using one of the great observability tools out there, you probably already mark your data with important events that may affect it- deployments, configuration changes, etc. But what about changes Kubernetes makes on its own like autoscaling events? We’ll talk about Knative Eventing and how we can use it to automatically mark these events in your data, and some other ways you can use it to improve your Observability.\n\n===\n\nTyler Britten\nTyler has spent the last 18 years working with cloud, virtualization, and infrastructure technologies. Prior to joining Pivotal/VMware, Tyler worked in technical marketing and developer advocacy roles for Red Hat, IBM, and EMC. He also worked as a consultant and a network engineer for a Fortune 1000 company. When the computers are off, he likes to spend time outdoors hiking, biking, snowboarding, or tailgating at a Penn State game. He also has his pilot’s license and enjoys cooking and brewing beer."
