title: 'microXchg 2017 - Jorge Salamero: How to Monitor Microservices'
recordingDate: 1487950833
description: "First, containers radically changed how you could get visibility into your applications. As developers have started to leverage orchestration systems on top of containers, the game is changing yet again. What was a simple application on a host before is now a sophisticated, dynamically orchestrated, multi-container architecture. It’s amazing for development - but introduces a whole new set of challenges for monitoring.\nIn this talk we’ll lay out a few key principles for monitoring microservices and the containers they are based on. These principles are based on my experience, but also leverage the wisdom of hundreds of organizations that are currently monitoring microservices with Docker, Kubernetes and Mesos. \nWe’ll address issues such as:Do host-based metrics matter any more? If so, when?What techniques can be used to extract application data from inside containers?How do you resolve tricky issues like greedy containers?When can you leverage (Kubernetes/Mesos/Docker) metadata to solve problems?How do you alert on elastic services that are growing and shrinking on-demand?\nYou’ll walk away with a good understanding of the challenges of monitoring microservices and how you can set your team up for success. During this talk we’ll also cover open source tools you can use that are designed to monitor and troubleshoot your microservices."
