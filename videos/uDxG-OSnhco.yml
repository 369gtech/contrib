title: 'NSDI ''20 - TCP ≈ RDMA: CPU efficient Remote Storage Access with i10'

description: "TCP ≈ RDMA: CPU efficient Remote Storage Access with i10\n\nJaehyun Hwang, Qizhe Cai, Ao Tang, and Rachit Agarwal, Cornell University\n\nThis paper presents design, implementation and evaluation of i10, a new remote storage stack implemented entirely in the kernel. i10 runs on commodity hardware, allows unmodified applications to operate directly on kernel's TCP/IP network stack, and yet, saturates a 100Gbps link for remote accesses using CPU utilization similar to state-of-the-art user-space and RDMA-based solutions.\n\nView the full NSDI '20 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi20/technical-sessions"
