description: "Google Tech Talks\nJune 4, 2008\n\nABSTRACT\n\nSpeaker: Andrew Ireland\nAndrew Ireland graduated with a First Class Hons degree in Computing Science from the University of Stirling.\nSupported by a Carnegie Scholarship, he continued his studies at Stirling obtaining a PhD.  He then moved to the University of Edinburgh, where  he took up the post of teaching assistant within the then Department of Artificial Intelligence. He joined the Mathematical Reasoning Group at Edinburgh in 1990 as Research Associate, where he worked on techniques for automating the search for formal proofs, in particular proof by mathematical induction and proof planning. In 1995, he became a lecturer in Computer Science at \nHeriot-Watt University, and was promoted to senior lecturer  in 2005. He is a founder member of the Dependable Systems Group at Heriot-Watt, and has maintained close collaborative links with the Mathematical Reasoning Group.  This is reflected in his research, which focuses upon the role of formal proof within the development of dependable software systems, both verification and synthesis. The applied nature of his research has led him into collaborative research projects with Praxis High Integrity Systems and QinetiQ. He will\nbe Program Co-Chair for the IEEE/ACM International Automated Software Engineering Conference (ASE) in\n2008 which will be held in L'Aquila, Italy."
