description: "Sean Johnson\n\nAmazon's Identity and Access Management is a risky needle to thread when it comes to deploying into the cloud, especially when it comes to empowering your developers to make their own changes. In this talk I will be showing how to leverage PyTest to test your policies before they hit production.\n\nhttps://2019.pycon-au.org/talks/securing-your-aws-identity-management-pipeline-with-pytest\n\nPyCon AU, the national Python Language conference, is on again this August in Sydney, at the International Convention Centre, Sydney, August 2 - 6 2019.\n\nVideo licence: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 - https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU\n\nFri Aug  2 11:50:00 2019 at Cockle Bay"
