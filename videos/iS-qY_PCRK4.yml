language: English
recordingDate: 1625753624
description: "In this episode, our co-founders Sandro Mancuso and Mashooq Badar and Spain Managing Director José E. Rodríguez Huerta discuss if it is possible to bring Agile and Developers back together. What was Agile originally about? Why developers got disheartened with the Agile evolution? What went wrong? What role Software Craftsmanship played in the evolution of Agile and how developers feel today? How Lean and DevOps fit into the mix? And most importantly, is our industry better today than it was before? How does the future look like?  Those are just some of the topics discussed in this episode.\n\nIf you would like us to discuss a topic, please let us know in the comments and we will do our best to address it in a future episode. Any topics around Agile, Software Craftsmanship, Extreme Programming, technical practices, thought leadership, architecture, management, team dynamics, or anything else related to technology or software projects are welcome. \n\nThe idea of the Fireside chat series is to record many informal conversations we normally have outside working hours. Topics are normally decided just before we start recording. Our objective is to have spontaneous conversations instead of something more structured or scripted. \n\nFor more information about Codurance, please visit our website: https://codurance.com/."
