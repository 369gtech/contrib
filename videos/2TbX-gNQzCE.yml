description: "Google Tech Talk\r\nJanuary 4, 2012\r\n\r\nPresented by Jason Rodi\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nhttp://blog.thenomads.com/?p=5603\r\n\r\n\"To reiterate the project, I have chartered a great ship, the HANSE EXPLORER, to traverse the sub-antarctic seas from Cape to Cape (Cape Horn, South America, to Cape of Good Hope, South Africa).  Our journey will bring us to Bouvet Island, the furthest uninhabited island in the world.  Weather permitting, we will attempt a climb to it's summit, an extinct volcano.\r\n\r\nI wish to bring three poles of human awareness on the trip, three people representing knowledge, philosophy, and creativity in the goal of returning with a vision of the future.\r\n\r\nFrom February 8th to March 12th 2012, The EXPEDITION for the FUTURE will travel from the end to the beginning of civilization.\r\nIt would be an honour if Google joined us in creating this vision of the future.  My goal is to produce a television documentary about the journey, an interactive book authored by the three poles, and an educational experience for museums and planetariums.  With Google's involvement we can maximize this great content opportunity even more.\""
