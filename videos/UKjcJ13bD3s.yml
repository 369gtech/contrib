title: 'Functional Patterns for the Asynchronous Web'

description: "Asynchronous programming is the latest hype for web development.  While Asynchronous programming can help improve total throughput on a multi-core machine, the current state of the art lacks common patterns for how to define asynchronous flow.\n\nIn this presentation from the 2013 Northeast Scala Symposium, Typesafe's Josh Suereth covers those patterns, from joining together a series of asynchronous operations to chaining a pipeline of asynchronous tasks. Josh discusses a few core abstractions that help define asynchronous workflow (applicative functors, monads, traversal), then uses these same abstractions to test the same flows synchronously.\n\n** Visit our site for more content on Scala, including the rest of the presentations from NE Scala 2013: http://marakana.com/s/tags/scala"
