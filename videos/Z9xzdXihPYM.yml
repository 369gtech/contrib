title: 'Beyond the Cookbook: Using Workflow to Bring Continuous Delivery to Any Project - May 23, 2017'
recordingDate: 1496962288
description: "Jean-Paul Robinson, DevOps Architect at SAP NS2 - ChefConf 2017\n\nWhile we all know workflow provides an easy way to do continuous integration/delivery for cookbooks, we also all have other parts that need to be developed and maintained for a successful DevOps environment. This talk will provide information on how to extend the power of delivery to those other projects, and provide the basics needed to understand creating build cookbooks well enough to create one for any project. Topics covered: Understanding the build cookbook, what the phases of the build cookbook are, and how workflow uses them. Using dependencies to tie together both cookbook and non-cookbook items. Demo: Using workflow to build a small web application including building the Web server from source, and delivering to an end environment."
