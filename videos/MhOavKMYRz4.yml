Moreover, some people find reading someone else’s code boring, frustrating or even creepy. Others consider this activity a waste of time.\nHowever, this is a common misconception which must be cleared. Do you want to know why? Are you still wondering how to master the art of reading code? Then come and hear it!\nThis talk will be helpful for newbies who got stuck and don’t know how to start reading and understanding someone else’s code, as well as for professionals who want to structure their knowledge and learn some new patterns."
