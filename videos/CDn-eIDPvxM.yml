description: "I wanted a quicker way to figure out the loot that monsters had. That also turned out to be a good reason to learn how to use a module and understand YAML a bit more.\nOnce I was able to quickly get loot, what about determining what the kinds of things the players met? It was an ideal excuse to write a dispatch table. Once I had that written I wanted to share it. Instead of trying to figure out how to package it up, I learned how to use the Mojolicious web framework to make it a web app.\nForm fillable PDFs make it easy to provide pre-generated characters for players at a gaming convention. What if I could start with a simple YAML file and have a program fill out the PDF for me?\nMuch of my hobby code Iâ€™ve written is to support one of my favorite hobbies, RPGs.\nAfter attending this talk I hope that you will better understand how to:\nuse a module to randomly generate events\nuse a dispatch table instead of nested if structures\nshare a program you wrote that goes from the command line to the web.\nuse your hobbies to improve your skills in other areas of your life\nsharing your work with a community makes you aware of how you code\nSlides available at: https://archive.org/details/using-rpgs-to-fuel-my-code-habit"
