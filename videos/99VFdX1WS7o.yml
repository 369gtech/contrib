description: 'Software developers spend most of their time working with code on the literal level. Unfortunately, the vast amount of design flaws hides behind hundreds of interrelated packages, classes, and methods, destroying your system deliberately. In this talk will supply you with the knowledge necessary to manage the complexity of your logical design from theoretical, practical and tooling perspectives. Time to keep architecture in a predictable and manageable state!'
