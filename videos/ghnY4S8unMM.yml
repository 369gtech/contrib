title: 'Building Code Analyzers with the new C# compiler platform (Roslyn) - Filip W'
recordingDate: 1473101914
description: "We all love Resharper and its amazing code analysis capabilities, right? Now with Roslyn you can built IDE code fixes and refactoring extensions yourself. Move class to a dedicated file? Easy. Enforce coding conventions? Why not. Finding logical issues on the code? Absolutely.\nWe'll have a look at everything that's needed for building analyzers, such as, for example, how you can traverse the syntax trees and obtain semantic information about a code base using Roslyn.\n\nThere is also a plot twist in all of that. Are Visual Studio Roslyn Analyzers really only for Visual Studio? We'll find out."
