This presentation gives an overview of the current status and future work. \n\nThis talk is a replacement for the cancelled talk by intel's Manasi Navare \"Display Stream Compression: More pixels, faster, over DisplayPort\", as intel decided not to approve travel for Manasi. \n\nRoom: K.4.401\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 14:00:00+01"
