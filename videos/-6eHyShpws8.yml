It's operated by the Wikimedia Foundation, a non-profit. \r\n\r\nLearn more about some of the latest developments in wiki technology: a new editing interface for Wikipedia; social features that support collaboration; a new labs and application development infrastructure for volunteers; improved media support; developments in structured data, and more. \r\n\r\nWikimedia's tech projects are 100% open source, and we're hoping Google and Wikimedia can learn from each other.\r\n\r\n-------\r\nLicense:\r\nCreative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0)\r\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode"
