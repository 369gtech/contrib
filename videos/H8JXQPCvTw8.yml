I love discussing about FP, distributed systems and cloud architecture.\n\ncltdl.fr/me\n\nTDD as in Type-Driven Development\n\nTest-Driven Development is widely accepted as good practice. But can we do better? By specifying behaviour with types, you can go a long way, with more confidence and with less hassle than with tests.\nIn this talk, we'll see a new vision of types. We'll see about how types allow us to prove properties about our program and how genericity is a powerful tool for specification. We'll go on to discover means of reasoning based on types. Finally, we'll explore the complementarity between types and tests.\n\nhttp://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2018/clement-delafargue"
