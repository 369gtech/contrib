description: "Are you having a hard time pinpointing errors as they arise? With distributed systems and complex environments, it’s more important than ever to be able to understand what’s happening, and identify the root-cause of an issue in real time. This is even more crucial when your systems need to scale quickly or handle traffic spikes efficiently.  \n\nA modern log management platform with flexible log processing can help to add value to Erlang and Elixir ecosystems. By utilizing existing open-source tools it’s easy to take the data from a system written on top of the beam vm and ingest it into a log management platform for live or after-the-fact analysis. Users of tools such as Grafana can even use this type of platform as the data lake for their existing metrics dashboard by ingesting their metrics into it.\n\nIn this webinar, Kresten Krab Thorup - CTO and Founder of Humio and Stender Boisen - Solution Architect at Humio demonstrate the value of a platform built specifically for streaming log data that allows organizations to have complete observability for large, scable deployments, where real-time communication and user experience is critical to the success of the business.\n\nERLANG SOLUTIONS - \n- Website: https://www2.erlang-solutions.com/btw... \n- Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/ErlangSolutions \n- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/erla... \n- GitHub: https://github.com/esl\n\n HUMIO-\n- Website https://www.humio.com/\n- Twitter: https://twitter.com/meethumio\n- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/humio/\n- GitHub: https://github.com/humio"
