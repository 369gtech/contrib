recordingDate: 1396870647
description: "In this talk we will present a number of common patterns from Erlang systems and how these patterns relates to business needs.\n\nMost of the patterns revolve around the notion of how failure is handled and we will discuss how active treatment of failure leads to better options for the product owner when it comes to prioritising fixes and new features.\n\nBy modelling the patterns using OPM (Object-Process Methodology) we get a new way of talking about Erlang systems and architectures, which will make our thoughts and insights easier to share."
