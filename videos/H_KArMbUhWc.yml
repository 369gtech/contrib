description: "Russ Kennedy\nVP of Product Strategy\nCleversafe\n\nCleversafe has created a breakthrough technology that solves petabyte and beyond big data storage problems. This solution drives up to 90% of the storage costs out of the business while enabling secure and reliable global access and collaboration. Cleversafe is combining the power of Cleversafe's Dispersed StorageÂ® System with Hadoop MapReduce on the same platform. This solution replaces the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) which relies on 3 copies to protect data thereby significantly improving reliability and allowing analytics at a scale previously unattainable. Many of the world's largest data repositories rely on Cleversafe for limitless data storage."
