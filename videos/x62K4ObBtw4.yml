description: "This video was recorded at Scala Days Berlin 2016\nfollow us on Twitter @ScalaDays or visit our website for more information http://scaladays.org \n\nAbstract:\nIn this talk we'll have a deeper look into Akka Streams (the implementation) and Reactive Streams (the standard). The term streams has been recently pretty overloaded, so we'll disambiguate what streams are and what they aren't. We'll dive into a number of real life scenarios where applying back-pressure helps to keep your systems fast and healthy at the same time. We'll mostly focus on the Akka Streams implementation, but the general principles apply to any kind of asynchronous programming."
