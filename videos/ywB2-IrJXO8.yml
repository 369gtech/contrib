language: English
recordingDate: 1633612216
description: "TypeScript is often praised for adding a layer of bug protection on top of JavaScript applications. But, how can we also use TypeScript to improve the readability of our React component interfaces for our fellow team members?\n\nJust because types compile, doesnâ€™t mean they are helping to document and describe our code for our future selves and others.\n\nPerhaps we can shift our perspective about TypeScript from a bug catching tool to a developer experience tool that enables us to write reasonable and intuitive code interfaces.\n\nIn this talk, you will learn how to think like a consumer and take advantage of basic and advanced TypeScript types to enhance the readability of your React component APIs.\n\nSlides: https://github.com/darcar31/slides/blob/master/2021/JSWorld/BuildingConsiderateReactComponentAPIswithTypeScript-JSWorld2021.pdf\n\nJSWORLD Conference: https://jsworldconference.com/\nSign up for our newsletter: https://www.frontenddeveloperlove.com/newsletter\nStay up to date via LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/frontendlove/\n\nPowered by https://passionatepeople.io\n\n#unittests #webaudio #unittesting #hiphop #frontendlove or #vuejsamsterdam #javascript #reactacademy #react #microinteractions #designsystems #javascript #artificialintelligence #amsterdam #speaker #conference #frontendlove #frontenddeveloperlove #javascriptconference #frontendconference #vue #angular #react #cfp #theateramsterdam #meetup #conferences #events"
