description: "Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) methodologies have traditionally served consumer products and enterprise applications. These programs are usually well defined, with established architectures, target markets and product development cycles that span months or years.\n\nEnter the Internet of Things, where there are no pre-defined form factors. An “IoT product” may be a smart fridge, a pacemaker, or a smart city. Makers of these classes of devices are often small/medium sized businesses, who are racing against the large corporates and other similar sized competitors to launch their products first. They look for standards in communication protocols, software stacks, libraries, and reuse them wherever possible. But standards are few and rarely one-size-fits-all. When it comes to securing IoT products, there are myriad of challenges on both process and technical fronts.\n\nOur presentation introduces the audience to a cutting-edge version of Security Development Lifecycle, called the Security & Privacy Development Lifecycle (SPDL). Tailored specifically for IoT platforms, the SPDL is an agile framework that breaks-up a “generic” IoT architecture into its logical sub-components, accounts for the security assessment activities for each of them, as well as for the entire ecosystem. Privacy is woven into the process, and privacy-specific activities are planned at each step of the SPDL. Using standard waterfall-oriented SDL methodologies for IoT programs can be challenging and messy. We talk about the shortcomings of these existing models, and how our proposed SPDL framework addresses them.\n\nAs we write this, there’s extensive media coverage on companies collecting and sharing user data with third parties leading to global consequences. Compliance with privacy (for example, consent rules in GDPR) can be very challenging for IoT. We explore some of these topics, and also introduce a privacy vulnerability scoring framework (CPVSS) that can aid in measuring, prioritizing and addressing privacy breaches and data thefts.\n\n\nSpeakers\n\nSumanth Naropanth\nInformation Security Leader - IoT, Cloud and Mobile\nCEO of Deep Armor Business and technical leader in information security.
