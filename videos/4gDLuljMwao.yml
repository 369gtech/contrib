title: 'How to Secure and Monitor External Service Access With a Service Mesh'
language: English
recordingDate: 1581025255
description: "One of the key operational challenges of securing microservices is understanding, securing and monitoring access to external services. A service mesh like Istio can enable organizations to offload this critical functionality from applications to the infrastructure, thereby decoupling the developer and operations teams and gaining efficiency.\n\nThis webinar will explore various architectural options available to secure traffic to external services and their tradeoffs when using Istio. Neeraj will also cover how operations teams can incrementally increase their security posture by using telemetry from Istio and configuring explicit policies for external services access control."
