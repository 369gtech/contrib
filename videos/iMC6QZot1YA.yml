description: "Spring Initializr is used to generate in excess of 1,000,000 projects per month from the WebUI, IDE plugins or even command line. But what’s not always appreciated is just how flexible a tool it can be.\n \nAt Morgan Stanley, we’re undergoing a major project to evolve our technology landscape towards one that is cloud-friendly, agile and DevOps focused. Moving several thousand Java developers into a new world of cloud-friendly microservices is a daunting task that demands tool support to be at all feasible. In this talk, we’ll describe how Morgan Stanley is building a platform around Spring Initializr that improves developer productivity at every level. This includes encouraging a consistent approach in how development teams use open source libraries by simplifying adoption of best practices, integration with CI/CD pipelines, and software lifecycle management (including metrics gathering, infrastructure provision, migration to newer versions of software, and even developer onboarding).\n\nElspeth Minty, Head of Java Platform Engineering at Morgan Stanley; \nGeorge Ball, Developer, Java Platform Engineering at Morgan Stanley\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/not-just-initializing"
