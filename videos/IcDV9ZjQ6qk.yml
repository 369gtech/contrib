description: "Machine Learning is one of the hottest new technologies impacting everything. Laurence Moroney meets with Joshua Gordon over coffee to talk about Machine Learning and his new show to help developers get started! P.S., in the video we used the word 'class' - really, it's a tutorial series, very informal.
