description: "Speaker: Jon Brisbin\nSlides: www.slideshare.net/jbrisbin\nReactor is a succinct and powerful foundational library for building reactive, fastdata applications on the JVM. Although it is part of the Spring IO platform, the core Reactor libraries have no dependency on Spring. Above the core library, there's direct support for the Disruptor via the high-speed Processor abstraction which provides a Reactor API over the RingBuffer, first-class support for the high-performance JavaChronicle persistent message-passing library through the flexible PersistentQueue abstraction, first-class support for Groovy closures and @CompileStatic, high-performance TCP client and server support based on Netty 4.0, powerful annotation-based Spring support, and much more. Join Jon Brisbin at the event to get introduced to the first major GA release of Reactor, and learn how Reactor's Promise and Stream APIs are used to wrangle the inherent complexity of asynchronous, event-driven application code."
