And Formula 1 cars produce more than their share.\n\nI will present a working demonstration of how modern data streaming can be applied to the data acquisition and analysis problem posed by modern motorsports.\n\nInstead of bringing multiple Formula 1 cars to the talk, I will show how we instrumented a high fidelity physics-based automotive simulator to produce realistic data from simulated cars running on the Spa-Francorchamps track. We move data from the cars, to the pits, to the engineers back at HQ.\n\nThe result is near real-time visualization and comparison of performance and a great exposition of how to move data using messaging systems like Kafka. The code from this talk will be made available as open source."
