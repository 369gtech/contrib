recordingDate: 1576205441
description: "In this talk, Blazor's two architects will take you deeper into the framework, showing a range of more advanced features and their internal workings. We'll dig into server-side Blazor and how we built the SignalR-based mechanism for efficiently streaming UI updates, as well as authorization in Blazor WebAssembly, and more.\r\n\nThis will be a fairly informal talk that encourages conversation with the audience, so bring your questions! If you want to request any specific demos in advance, feel free to tell us on Twitter (Steve:@StevenSanderson, Ryan: @aVerySpicyBoi).\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks, courses, and conferences in the following links:\r\nhttps://ndcsydney.com/\r\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
