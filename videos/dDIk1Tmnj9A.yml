description: "Discover how to achieve superpowers by embracing machine learning in JavaScript using TensorFlow.js in the browser.  Learn what machine learning is, get a high-level overview of how it works, get inspired through a whole bunch of creative prototypes (from invisibility to teleportation) that push the boundaries of what is possible in the modern web browser, and then take your own first steps with machine learning in minutes. By the end of the session, everyone (no matter what your background) will understand how to recognize an object of their choice, which could then be used in any creative way you can imagine on your own website. No background in machine learning is required. Take your first steps with TensorFlow.js!\n\nResources:\nLearn more about TFJS → https://goo.gle/2UXmFzX\nGet Inspired with top community projects → https://goo.gle/39kf2vE\n#MadeWithTFJS latest submissions → https://goo.gle/377lUKe\n\nSpeaker: Jason Mayes\n\nWatch all Chrome Developer Summit sessions here → https://goo.gle/cds20-sessions\nSubscribe to Google Chrome Developers here → https://goo.gle/ChromeDevs\n\n#chromedevsummit #chrome #machinelearning"
