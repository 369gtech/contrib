description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nRethinking the K8s DNS for the Modern Enterprise - Deepa Kalani & Venil Noronha, VMware \n\nThe Domain Name System (DNS) is the component that provides the most vital piece of information for one to locate and communicate with services running in a Kubernetes cluster. This technology provides a set of features for name resolution, service discovery, metrics collection, query tracing, etc. However, this is only sufficient to satisfy the requirements of traditional workloads, and modern enterprises demand more.    In this talk, we will discuss the state-of-the-art in the modern enterprise in the context of the Kubernetes DNS. We will present use-cases like extensive aliasing, multi-tenancy, security, etc. that stretch the capabilities of currently available DNS solutions like CoreDNS, Kube-DNS, etc. We will then examine possible approaches to solve these challenges and see where these technologies fall short and how they could be improved. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UacZ"
