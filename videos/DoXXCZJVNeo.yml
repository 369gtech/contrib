description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2018\n—\nWe will discuss how to implement a rapid web development framework in Modern C++, paying attention to ease-of-use and comparing favorable with frameworks of other lanuages. \n  \nThe Feather framework is composed of four cool libraries working together. These libraries are: \n\n*) cinatra, a flexible and powerful http/websocket library providing web services. It supports a functional interface and Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) for web applications. \n\n*) ormpp, an Object-relational mapping (ORM) library that provides a single interface for database access. It currently supports MySQL, PostgresSQL, and SQLite and can be extended to support other databases. \n\n*) render, a HTML template rendering library. \n\nWe’ll cover how these libraries work together to implement that Feather framework and how to use Feather to develop a web application rapidly.\n— \n\nYu Qi, oneflow\nTechnical Director\n\nYu is a C++ programmer with 10 years experience who lives in Zhuhai, Guangdong province, China. He loves modern C++ and has founded an open source community ( http://www.purecpp.org/ ) to promote C++11/14 in China. His focus is distributed systems and he is the author of rest_rpc, an RPC library implemented in C++14. Yu's github is https://github.com/qicosmos . Yu wrote a Chinese language book about C++11 in 2015: http://item.jd.com/11701870.html The title translates as \"C++11 In Depth.\"\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
