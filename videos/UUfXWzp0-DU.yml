description: "Google Tech Talk, May 5th, 2016, presented by Adam Barth\nABSTRACT: Archimedes once said \"give me a deep enough pipeline, and I shall move the world.\" Well, that's what he should have said in any case. This talk will describe the nuts and bolts of how Flutter transforms a tree of widgets into pixels on the screen at 60 Hz by pushing data through its pipeline of layout, painting, compositing, and finally rasterization.\n\nTo learn more about Flutter and how it helps developers build mobile apps, please visit https://flutter.io\n\nSee Ian Hickson's Google TechTalk on Flutter's Layered Design at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkyY9WCGMi0"
