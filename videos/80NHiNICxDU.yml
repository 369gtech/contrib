description: 'When Microsoft moved their compilers and framework to an open source model, they gave us unparalleled access to a real world, large scale managed code base. Inside the source code repositories there are many lessons to learn, and lots of useful bits of code we can borrow. In this session, we’ll explore the code base and look for hidden gems. Some of these gems are useful, other bits make for interesting trivia, and some classes are so bizarre you’ll have to see them to believe them. Expect equal levels of entertainment and education in this whirlwind tour of C# code.'
