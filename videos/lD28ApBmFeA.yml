description: "Andres Almiray, Principal Consultant, Trivadis AG\n\nThe Java Persistence API (JPA) is the go-to solution for writing the persistence layer in many enterprise and cloud-enabled applications. There are many tricks that can be applied to make the application performant, and one in particular is the configuration of the second-level cache (L2C for short). This session presents a real use case, searching for the optimal configuration of different JPA and L2C combinations. It includes a walk-through of the approach taken, from naive measurements and first tests to, ultimately, JMH benchmarks."
