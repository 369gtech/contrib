title: 'Making humans cool again: A conversation with Paul English'
language: English
recordingDate: 1476815289
description: 'Paul English’s last startup, Kayak, used search technology to commoditize travel; his new one, Lola, bets that people will pay a premium for a better experience. Paul’s vision of pairing up AI and human expertise to create a far better user experience than either could do alone is at the very heart of the Next Economy story and has so much to teach us about how to do business in the future. How can we not feature a guy who says that he wants his new startup to “make humans cool again”?'
