description: "Apps aren't just for phones and tablets anymore, you'll often need to target a variety of platforms and form factors from iPhones to Xboxes. How do we architect our solutions to maximize code reuse in a sane manner? Can we favor composition over inheritance all the way through our technology stack?\n\nIn this session you'll learn about the myriad mechanisms to share your C# (or F#!) code across all platforms using Xamarin, including the new options presented by Visual Studio 2017 and .NET Core, such as multi-targeting.\n\nYou'll see demos in C# on how to level up from a view model per screen, to using conductors to orchestrate multiple view models working together. We'll cover composing view models to create reusable screen patterns such as Master / Details while keeping your code more flexible, maintainable and testable."
