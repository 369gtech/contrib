description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nArchitecture Patterns To Enable Stateful Communication Over Stateless Serverless Apis - Wenbo Zhu, GoogleSDCC \n\nIn this talk, Wenbo will go through the issues of exposing stateful and long-lived APIs with serverless based end-points. To ease the development of client applications, one architecture pattern will be to layer stateful communication on top of stateless RPCs to have the benefits of both worlds, i.e. simplicity and real-time guarantees of stateful APIs for client applications, and scalability and reliability of stateless services for serverless based end-points. A detailed case study will be presented, such as building a real-time online chat application."
