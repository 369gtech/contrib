description: "Gary Whitehill (Entrepreneur Week) - Humans deserve better. Roadmap to a 21st century city.\nThe speech was given on 2016-05-18 at infoShare 2016 (Inspire Stage) in Gdańsk. http://infoshare.pl\n\nGrounded in the reality of now, Gary Whitehill is the 21st Century futurist who believes that unstable times create incredible opportunities. Since 2013, Gary has been to over 60 countries to witness how power, structure and control – the elements that have bound people for centuries – are facing extinction. He has seen a future where humanity is enriched through inclusion and participation. Only human ingenuity will help people rise above global turmoil that is currently converging in economic, political, technological, environmental, cultural and social pillars of life. Gary predicts that the structures and strategies we have come to rely on to hold society together will be made evermore irrelevant by the speed of distributed innovation. They will be replaced by agile tactics and fluid networks which embrace less dependence on centralized authority. In his global speaking engagements and consulting work, Gary realigns political and business leaders worldwide around new ways for forward-thinking companies, cities, and governments to achieve “smart” humanity-centered outcomes to thrive in the 21st Century. He spends time in communities helping everyday people to shape the energy that is being unleashed in this century of change into innovation networks that empower cooperation, creativity and inclusiveness. Because humans deserve better! \n\nFollow infoShare:\nhttps://facebook.com/infosharepl\nhttps://twitter.com/infosharepl\nhttps://www.instagram.com/infoshare/\nhttps://plus.google.com/+infoshare/"
