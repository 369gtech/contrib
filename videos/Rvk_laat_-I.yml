description: "Spring I/O Bridge (online conference) - 15 May 2020\n\nGitHub repo: https://github.com/alek-sys/spring-microframework-talk\n\nQuite often Spring is opposed to so called “micro” frameworks in Java world. “Micro” means different things to different people, but usually it implies reduced runtime footprint and code simplicity. In this talk, I’ll show that you don’t have to abandon your favourite Spring Boot to a new and shiny thing to achieve the same result. Also I’ll show how to find the balance between simplicity and productivity, improve runtime efficiency, e.g. image size, memory footprint, and startup time when using Spring Boot."
