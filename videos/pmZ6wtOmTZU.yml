description: "The human factor: Inspiring the pursuit of success and averting drift into failure\n\nSidney Dekker, Professor, Griffith University \n\nThe 'human factor' has long been seen as a weak link in otherwise well-functioning systems, and control through compliance and bureaucracy has often been relied on as a solution. But research over the past decades, from a number of industries, shows something very different. People are critical to the discovery and development of pathways to successâ€”despite organizational, managerial and operational obstacles, goal conflicts and resource constraints. Investigating why things go well, rather than hunting and tabulating individual errors, is proving to be a much better predictor of both failure and success. It can help avert organizational drift into failure by making visible the little and larger sacrifices people make every day to get stuff done. It can also inspire organizations to offer their people autonomy, mastery and purpose in their roles, allowing creativity and innovation to blossom.\n\nDOES17 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
