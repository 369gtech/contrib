description: "Keynote: Delivering Simpler, Clearer, Faster Government Services with Cloud Foundry - Lindsay Holmwood, Head of Development, Australian Government Digital Transformation Office\n\nNobody interacts with government because they want to - they interact with government because they have to, and most people come away from online interactions feeling more confused than when they started. \n\nThat's why the Digital Transformation Office was created in 2015 – to change the way Australian governments deliver services, by relentlessly focusing all delivery activities on user needs, and modernising technical delivery methods. \n\nCloud Foundry is at the core of this technical modernisation, with the DTO providing a Cloud Foundry-based delivery platform to government for building new services. Every team gets a CD pipeline, centralised monitoring and logging, and an app runtime – driving a culture change through tools. \n\nIn this talk we'll learn about the problems with the traditional approach to digital service delivery in government, what opportunities Cloud Foundry creates for architecting the delivery of user-focused services, and how Cloud Foundry enables the DTO to help government deliver simpler, clearer, faster public services.\n\nLindsay Holmwood \nAustralian Government Digital Transformation Office\nHead of Development\nAustralia\nLindsay Holmwood is a engineering manager living in the Australian Blue Mountains.
