description: "\"Over the last several years of building a small startup that develops and works with original cognitive linguistics algorithms, we have often been asked or advised to differentiate our technology from traditional NLP. However, we have actually learned to solve certain problems by combining the two – first by using NLP to enhance our cognitive linguistics work and then by adding a cognitive layer to NLP tasks.\n\nWe will begin with a brief overview of cognitive linguistics and our company’s technology before looking at techniques and examples.\n\nWhile this talk will involve proprietary technology, we will provide access to an API to allow participants to further explore the topic.\"\n\nI will present an overview of what we have learned in my company from combining our own proprietary cognitive linguistics technology with simple NLP methods such as sentiment analysis and named entity recognition. We will explore several use cases and discuss the impact of using both approaches together.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
