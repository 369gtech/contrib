He studied art and physics at the University of Wisconsin -- Madison, where he did his doctoral research on the simulation of neutrino detectors. His company, NPX Designs, specializes in software for large-scale science projects, and has done work ranging from Linux device driver development to interactive Web site development for experimental control and scientific visualization. He has also exhibited artwork  in half a dozen states across the USA, and created one of the first Web sites for presenting artwork (Jan. 1994).
