title: 'Stephanie Gasche: Measuring Performance - Quantifying the Work of a Scrum Master at Stretch'
recordingDate: 1582182013
description: "Scrum Masters are an essential part of any Agile transformation, yet the role is so new that it is difficult to know whether they are actually adding value. If you wish to know how you may be able to measure the impact from both the perspective of the Scrum Master and management, come to my talk.\n\nAgile evangelists typically tell companies that each of their teams needs a Scrum Master. However, we rarely show proof of their added value to the teams. Could it be that 18 years after the Agile Manifesto, we still do not know how to measure the performance of a Scrum Master? In this talk, we will look at metrics for each of the three aspects of a Scrum Master role: Facilitator, Servant Leader and Change Agent. I will provide Scrum Masters with practical tips on how to continuously measure themselves and use that as an argument for pay raises in their performance reviews and a larger lever in the change process. While metrics are often seen as negative, we will have a look at the Do‘s and Don’ts of using them and why Scrum Masters should actually be eager for their companies to introduce metrics. Come and join me for a different view on this controversial topic.\n\nStretch is a non-profit leadership and management conference that brings 500 attendees and 16 speakers from all around the world who want to build effective organizations since 2013. An international platform and community for leaders and managers to share stories, hands-on solutions and explore new trends and ideas to lead, fail, learn and stretch.
