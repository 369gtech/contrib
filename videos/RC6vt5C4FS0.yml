description: "Laziness is one of Larry Wall’s “three great virtues of a programmer”, but most people probably don’t consider it a virtue when writing tests! Wouldn’t it be great though, if we could write a program that generates our tests for us? As it turns out, we can and should do this using property-based testing. I’ll go through some example testing scenarios in a few popular mobile programming languages, aiming to demonstrate:\n\n* What property-based testing is and why EVERYONE should be using it (not just people coding in functional languages!)\n* How generators can quickly & easily come up with more thorough test inputs than a programmer typing in magic numbers\n* How to (and how not to) define properties to specify program behaviour\n* The genius of shrinkers and why they can save you hours of tedious debugging and questioning your life choices\n\nAttendees will gain a solid & practical understanding of how they can apply property-based testing to their own code, in fashion that is both enjoyable and lucrative.\n\nSam has a background in .NET enterprise development, but now works mainly on mobile apps & cloud services. He’s been an Apple fanboy since the 80s, and was coding Objective-C before it was cool. He mainly develops in Swift & F# these days, and actively tries to avoid writing any JavaScript.\n\nSam runs the Perth-based software consulting company codesplice, and organises the Perth iOS developers meetup group.\n\nFor more on YOW!
