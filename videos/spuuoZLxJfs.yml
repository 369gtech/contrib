description: "Further information: https://berlinbuzzwords.de/17/session/rolling-out-enterprise-kubernetes-clouds-sap\n\nIn this talk we give insights in how we have set up several Kubernetes clouds for SAP. We tell the whole story, from PoC state, first developer installations, testing until production. We implemented on premises, in internal and external IaaS clouds. We used Docker and Rkt, rolled out database applications and implemented deployment pipelines. Special applications have special needs, so we tweaked parameters. At the end, we implemented several self-installing, self-hosted, self-healing and extendable Kubernetes clusters, which allow application deployment on scale for cutting edge case involving high performance databases and number crunching applications.\n\nSpeaker:\nStefan Vetter & Thomas Fricke\nhttps://twitter.com/GreatSUN2009"
