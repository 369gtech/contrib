description: "Bert Jan Schrijver, Software craftsman, JPoint, OpenValue\n\nAngular is doubtless one of the most popular frameworks for building modern web front ends, and most of its concepts are not that far off from everything we know from the Java world. Take TypeScript, for example: you now can write proper typed code in the browser! This session’s speaker shares his experience as a Java developer developing Angular applications. He explains everything about tools such as npm, RxJS, Sass, Karma, and Protractor and compares them with their counterparts in the Java ecosystem. He starts with an empty IDE and live-codes his way to a working Angular application connected to a Spring Boot back end, sharing lots of tips, insights, and gotchas. After this session, you’ll know enough about Angular to get started right away."
