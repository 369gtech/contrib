description: "The Memex was proposed in 1945 as the ultimate organizational tool. The desk-sized device would store a user’s personal library and allow for information to be searched, organized, connected together with hyperlinks, and shared.\n\nWithout a device like this, its creator suggested, our species would drown in information overload and come to a premature end.\n\nTragically, zero of these devices were ever produced, but 72 years later, Andrew has built a Memex in JavaScript. He's built importers for dozens of different sources of personal data and data consumptions and put it all behind a graph-based API.\n\nHe’ll be going over the history of the Memex and demoing his own version by showing what type of queries, organizing tools, and visualization are available."
