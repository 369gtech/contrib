title: 'Git at Google: Making Big Projects (and Everyone Else) Happy, Dave Borowitz - Git Merge 2015'
recordingDate: 1431452392
description: 'Google likes to push the boundaries of what''s possible with Git. With big projects like Android and Chrome, we need some pretty big hosting infrastructure: we built a custom globally replicated storage layer, added bundles and bitmaps to reduce server load, and built specialized tools like Gerrit Code Review. But working on large Git-based projects is still not as nice as we''d like it to be. In this talk I''ll discuss what we''ve done to make large projects happy at Google, and what we hope to do to make large projects happy everywhere.'
