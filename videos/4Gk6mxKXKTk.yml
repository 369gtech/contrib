description: "The Chinese state run news agency Xinhua recently revealed the first Artificial Intelligence news anchor. They're now able to generate video of a newscaster using a model trained on real newscaster data and use it to disseminate information 24/7. When I saw this, I knew it was time to start studying China's role in the AI revolution in-depth. In this video, I'll cover China's power structure, generative adversarial networks, its startup scene, Confucianism, the social credit scoring system, algorithmic policing, surveillance, privacy, autonomous weapons, and convolutional neural networks. A lot of different topics to cover, but I hope this video provides a coherent narrative around the use of AI in China and how it plays into the global AI community.
