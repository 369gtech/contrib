description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nDistributed Computation with WASM and WASI - Bailey Hayes & Carl Sverre, SingleStore\n\nDistributed computation is a necessary paradigm for modern analytics. WASI-data is a new proposal for a WASI interface-type API that enables portable, host-, and language-independent ecosystems of composable WASM modules to support distributed algorithms. In this talk, we present the WASI-data interface design and demonstrate a reference implementation written in Rust. We will discuss WASI-data's potential to eliminate data lakes and how WASM could become the primary unit of compute for data processing systems."
