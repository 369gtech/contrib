description: "Speaker: Jordan Dea-Mattson, VP of Engineering\r\n\r\nFor the first week’s talk, we’ll be giving an overview of Scrum and how it works, including the processes, practices and artifacts involved. We’ll show you how to do it properly while avoiding cargo cult engineering. You’ll also learn the reasons why there are certain “rituals” around Scrum practices (such as daily standups and sprint planning) and why they are important to build high-performing product and engineering teams.\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.eventbrite.sg/e/carousell-level-up-applying-scrum-for-better-delivery-tickets-33690577424?aff=ebapi\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG"
