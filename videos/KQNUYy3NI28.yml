recordingDate: 1555660008
description: "The promise of cross-platform frameworks looks great on paper, and some of them do a pretty good job delivering actual results. \n\nBut with inherent differences between platforms, is \"build once, run anywhere\" even worth pursuing? \n\nLearn how you can share parts of your app between mobile platforms (and even the web!) without compromising quality, and delivering a best in class Android experience. \n\nDuring this talk I'll explain some ideas on how to structure not only your code, but also your teams, I'll show how to implement your own Kotlin MP libraries and showcase a few ones that you can use out-of-the-box."
