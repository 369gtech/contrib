description: "One of the main design considerations for the Java platform is to provide a secure environment for executing code from trusted and untrusted sources in a mobile world. Java comes with its own unique set of security challenges. Although the Java security architecture can protect users and systems from hostile programs downloaded over a network, it cannot defend against implementation bugs that occur in trusted code. Such bugs can inadvertently open the very holes that the security architecture was designed to contain. Java Secure Coding Guidelines helps avoid security bugs to keep Java safe. Therefore, this presentation provides examples of good and bad use of security patterns and gives advice on how refactorings will lead to safer programs.\n\n\nAuthor:\nMarc Schönefeld\nMarc is working within the Java Security community\nsince 2002, first as part of  this PhD thesis research, and later\n(2007-2011) as member of the Red Hat Security Response Team. \nIn 2011 he joined Oracle's Java Vulnerability team. \n\nView more trainings by Marc Schönefeld at https://www.parleys.com/author/marc-schonefeld\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
