title: 'GeeCON 2019: Jean-Philippe Bempel - Understanding Low Latency JVM GCs'
recordingDate: 1563984048
description: 'Since several years, the world of JVM GC evolved. A new kind of GC emerges: low latency GCs. Shenandoah is provided by Red Hat, Oracle open sourced ZGC in OpenJDK since JDK 11 and Azul C4 is sill there.​ As ''classical'' GCs are well understood, this talk will focus on internals of the most recent ones. We will explain Concurrent Marking (tri-color marking), the C4''s Load Value Barrier, Shenandoah''s Brooks Pointers and ZGC''s multi-mapping. Finally, how to choose a low latency GC?​'
