recordingDate: 1508461201
description: "In this talk I will share my teams gruelling journey in attempting to migrate a batch like system into a streaming framework.\n\nWalking through the various solutions that we tested using Flink, I'll be discussing each ones performance characteristics and bringing to light misconceptions in their designs.\n\nRoman spends most of his time building machine learning pipelines in Spark and Flink. He am quite fond of functional programming.\nHe is currently working obsessively on an async machine learning api. \nHe has also contributed heavily to Scoozie which is a Scala DSL for Oozie.\n\nFor more information on YOW!
