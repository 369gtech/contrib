description: "Recorded from a Live Event - Low Resolution\n\nMake It So: Interaction Design lessons from Science Fiction explores how sci-fi and interface design relate to each other. The authors, Nathan Shedroff and Chris Noessel, have developed a model that traces lines of influence between the two, and use this as a scaffold to investigate how the depiction of technologies evolve over time, how fictional interfaces influence those in the real world, and what lessons interface designers can learn through this process. This investigation of science fiction television shows and movies has yielded practical lessons that apply to online, social, mobile, and other media interfaces.\n\nIn this webcast, Chris Noessel will help you:\n\n    Learn the ways you as a design influence sci-fi\n    Learn the ways sci-fi are influencing your users\n    Understand how anthropomorphism affects user expectations\n    Hear reminders of HCI lessons anchored in scifi\n    See sci-fi examples of concepts being developed in laboratories\n    See examples of lessons that can be applied from speculative technology\n\nAbout Chris Noessel\n\nChristopher Noessel, in his day job as managing director at the pioneering interaction design firm Cooper, designs products, services, and strategy for the health, financial, and consumer domains, among others. In his role as practice lead, he helps manage the \"generator\" type of interaction designers, helping them build their skills and lead client projects to greatness.\n\nChristopher has been doing interaction design for more than 20 years (longer than we've even been calling it that). He co-founded a small interaction design agency where he developed interactive exhibitions and environments for museums, and he worked as a director of information design at international Web consultancy marchFIRST, where he also helped establish the interaction design Center of Excellence.\n\nChristopher was one of the founding graduates of the now-passing-intolegend Interaction Design Institute Ivrea in Ivrea, Italy, where his thesis project was a comprehensive service design for lifelong learners called Fresh. The project was presented at the MLearn conference in London in 2003. He has since helped to visualize the future of counterterrorism as a freelancer, built prototypes of coming technologies for Microsoft, and designed telehealth devices to accommodate the crazy facts of modern health care in his role at Cooper.\n\nChristopher has written for online publications for many years, and was first published in print as co-author of the interaction design pattern chapter in the textbook edited by Simson Garfinkel, RFID: Applications, Security, and Privacy. His Spidey sense goes off at random topics, and this has led him to speak at conferences around the world about a wide range of things, including interactive narrative, ethnographic user research, interaction design, sex-related interactive technologies, free-range learning, the Interface Parenthesis and the future of interaction design, and the relationship between science fiction and interface design."
