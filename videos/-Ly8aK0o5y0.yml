This big data provides critical insight into the way government works, but thousands of datasets are published every day and are often ignored. How can we make this data accessible for everyone to analyze?\n\nWhen the UK government published every item of spending over £25,000, it was big data published in a complex way. UK Guardian Datablog made that data publicly available and asked its users to get involved in poring through the numbers. The result was readers and journalists working together to make real stories out of raw numbers.\n\nIn the past, journalists kept the raw information close to their chests; now by opening it up to the world, everyone becomes a potential data journalist. Every day the Guardian publishes the raw data behind the news using Google tools, opening up and making government statistics accessible in a form their readers can use.\n\nPublicly sharing and visualizing data can help gain insight and answers to questions that aren't immediately obvious. The public can combine the public data with their own. Using the tools available, anyone can now create their own stories and visualizations with the data, which leads to increased knowledge and action.\n\nIn this keynote, we explore how the UK Guardian Datablog is at the forefront of data journalism. We'll cover several of the tools and technologies they have used to collect, analyze and visualize, and share their data with the world.\n\n\nKathryn Hurley\n\nGoogle\nKathryn Hurley recently joined Google as a Developer Programs Engineer for Fusion Tables.
