title: 'LISA21 - "Disorganizing"" Your SRE Organization'
language: English
recordingDate: 1623258113
description: "\"Disorganizing\"\" Your SRE Organization\n\nLeonid Belkind, StackPulse\n\nMore than a year ago, COVID-19 has presented us with a challenge on how to establish and grow our SRE practice under new conditions of working from home (while doubling and then tripling our team). Instead of trying to treat the situation in a \"\"business as usual\"\" manner, we embarked on a journey to reorganize our SRE practices, tools, and culture. In this talk, we will share the assumptions we started the process with, our learnings during the process, and the state we ended in, after more than a year of a change.\n\nView the full LISA21 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa21/program"
