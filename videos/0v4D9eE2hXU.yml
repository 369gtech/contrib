description: "In this video from our Virtualization, Networking, and Storage video training course, expert author Bruce Hartpence teaches you some best practices associated with virtual machines. For more information about the course, as well as more free lessons, visit http://oreil.ly/2koF0B6. \n\nAbout the full course:\n\nVirtualization is central to modern communications. From cloud services to internal compute clusters, virtual machines and hypervisors play an ever growing role in client-server communications and in design discussions. But virtualization is not limited to servers. Virtual private networking, virtual circuit and logical topologies have used many to one ratios to describe the relationship between logical connections running over physical pathways. In addition, a virtual environment such as that seen in a data center is not isolated. A significant amount of connectivity and configuration is necessary to allow virtual nodes to exchange data with physical entities.\n\nThis video course adopts the ideas espoused by DevOps with a “full stack engineer” approach. The goal is to provide students with working knowledge and skills in all three areas. In this way, they are able to more effectively communicate with others in comprehensive projects, develop their own abilities and understand the issues associated with technology integration in these disciplines.\n\nConnect with us and join the conversation:\n\nSubscribe to O'Reilly on YouTube: http://goo.gl/n3QSYi\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/oreillymedia\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/OReilly\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/oreillymedia/"
