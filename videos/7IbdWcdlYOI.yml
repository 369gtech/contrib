title: 'Reactive Microservices with Vert.x by Edson Yanaga and Burr Sutter'
language: English
recordingDate: 1478851761
description: "Everybody is talking about microservices and reactive programming these days. And there’s a reason for that: the high-demand and high-scale distributed world that we have today, reacting to events in an asynchronous and non-blocking fashion seems the right approach to deal with scalability. And to achieve microservices you need a lightweight, fast, modular, high-performance and un-opinionated environment. Meet Vert.x: a toolkit for building reactive applications on the JVM.\n\nCome to this session to see how you can use Vert.x to create reactive code using Java, Groovy, JavaScript or other JVM languages. We’ll demonstrate how to build Vert.x-based systems leveraging the unique Vert.x event bus for creating apps with real-time communications from the modern web browser to the cloud and back again. Have fun with a large number of live demonstrations that will cause you to reconsider your reliance on monoliths and consider leaving tradition behind for an event-driven, reactive, microservice-focused architecture.\n\nEdson Yanaga, Red Hat's Director of Developer Experience, is a Java Champion and Microsoft MVP. He is also a published author and a frequent speaker at international conferences, discussing Java, Microservices, Cloud Computing, DevOps, and Software Craftsmanship.\n\n[HKC-9910]"
