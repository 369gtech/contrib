description: "Full title: MUD to OOP: An Introduction to Object-Oriented JavaScript in Online RPGs\n\nPresented at Abstractions II, a software conference Code & Supply in Pittsburgh, PA August 21-23, 2019. Learn more at http://www.codeandsupply.co or https://abstractions.io. \n\nThe RAW CUTS series is comprised of selections from a few of our stages wherein the raw video was of high enough quality for C&S to release it before post-production. \n\nPost-production for a community-run conference with as many speakers and as low of a budget as Abstractions is an enormous and time-consuming undertaking. If you're interested in volunteering your time and CPU cycles to help with post-production, we can use your help. Email us at support@codeandsupply.co and we'll get you into the mix. You'll be permitted to credit yourself in the video pre-roll and credits and we'll thank you in this text and on social media.\n\nInterested in sponsoring professional post-production costs in exchange for your company's name and logo in the video forevermore? Contact us at sponsorship@abstractions.io. Opportunities start at $1,000.\n\n-----\n\nText-based online multi-user dungeons, or “MUDs” have been around since the 1980s, and are still popular in 2019. Based on Dungeons & Dragons, MUDs offer an interactive roleplaying experience, without the manual work of the tabletop game.\n\nThey taught me about the concept of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), long before I even knew what it was. Objects are used for virtually every aspect, from players and objects, to rooms and the non-playable characters we “fight”.\n\nIn my talk, I'm going to provide some actual examples of MUD objects, represented in JavaScript!\n\nBy bridging the concepts of classes, attributes, and methods with object models in MUDs, new and experienced coders alike can better understand how objects interact, and the problems that objects solve in games.\n\nhttps://abstractions.io/schedule/#MUD%20to%20OOP:%20An%20Introduction%20to%20Object-Oriented%20JavaScript%20in%20Online%20RPGs-Nicole%20Archambault"
