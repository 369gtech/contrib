description: "Talk recording from AmsterdamJS August 2018 Meetup\nhttps://www.meetup.com/AmsterdamJS/events/252195725/\n\nLet's talk about the way engineering and product work together. Andrey believes the future of our projects depends on it. He has been jumping between those two roles for several years. It put things into perspective for him and he’d like to share his learnings. It is a mental model and a set of concrete tools and techniques developers can use to make products better and reduce the amount of work wasted.\n\nAbout Andrey\nProgrammer, product manager, podcaster. Andrey is now working on Polychops (http://polychops.com/) – a service that helps musicians improve their rhythm, collaborate and inspire each other. His job before was making sure Productive Mobile (http://productivemobile.com/) were building the right thing."
