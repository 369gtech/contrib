recordingDate: 1325711720
description: "A follow-on to Analyzing Social Networks on Twitter, this webcast will concentrate on the social component of Twitter data rather then the questions of data gathering and decomposition. Using a predefined dataset, we will attempt to find communities of people on Twitter that express particular interests. We will also mine Twitter streams for cascades of information diffusion, and determine most influential individuals in these cascades. The webcast will contain an initial introduction to Social Network Analysis methods and metrics.\n\nAbout Maksim Tsvetovat:\n\nMaksim Tsvetovat is an interdisciplinary scientist, a software engineer, and a jazz musician.
