description: "All kids should learn to code! Yes, I think we programmers all agree with Bill Gates and Sheryl Sandberg that kids should learn programming. But what is programming? What should kids know? What should they practice? How should they practice? And how will we make programming more inclusive?\n\nIn her keynote, Felienne will take you through her research on programming for children, as well as her quest to make programming education for everyone."
