description: 'PHP continues to power over 80% of the entire internet, whereas .NET is arguably the most robust, secure and performant platform for software development. PeachPie is a project that aims to bridge the gap between the two worlds; it is an open-source compiler and runtime of PHP under .NET, sponsored by the .NET Foundation. Capable of running massive real-world applications, such as WordPress, Laravel or MediaWiki, PeachPie allows for bi-directional interoperability between PHP and .NET and provides performance as well as security benefits.'
