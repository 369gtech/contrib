title: '#ChefConf 2014: Clinton Wolfe, ''Bulletproofing Attributes With Validation And Tracing''--SFW'
recordingDate: 1400784183
description: "Everyone uses node attributes - they are the \"knobs\" that let you unleash the power of cookbooks, customizing them for each environment, role, or node. Attributes are incredibly flexible - you can set any value (string, boolean, number, array....) and have them interact with each other through precedence rules in innumerable ways....\n\nWhich is a total maintenance nightmare.\n\nHow do you disable something? 0/1 ? true/false ? \"true\"/\"false\" ? nil/\"dummy\"? Should that be a hostname or a URL? Does it matter? (YES! 0 is true!). Using the attribute-validator cookbook, you can define simple rules on an as-needed basis to enforce SANE values for attributes. Regex, hostname, collection size - even Proc checks.\n\nWhere did **that* value come from? I only override it 4 times, in the community cookbook, then in my wrapper, then in my role, then in my environment...* I'll show you how to use a special attribute tracing library to detect exactly when, where, and how a value was changed - throughout the course of the compilation and convergence. Then I'll go on to show how this tool can be used to experiment and understand Chef's precedence rules, making you a happier, more fulfilled person."
