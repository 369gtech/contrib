description: "This talk was presented during the React Native EU 2021 - the largest community conference in the world focused exclusively on React Native.\n\nAbstract:\nIt was not long ago when we released React Navigation 5, and announced it at RNEU. So I'm back again, this time with React Navigation 6. In this talk, I'll go through some highlights of React Navigation 6 and how it improves the DX, and discuss the reasons behind a major version bump.\n\nSatya is a maintainer of React Navigation who has been contributing to React Navigation from almost the beginning, and lead the work behind React Navigation 5. He also maintains many other Open Source libraries besides React Navigation. Besides buildings components with React & JavaScript, he also like to cook delicious food and play video games.\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/satya164 \nGithub: https://github.com/satya164"
