description: "Chris Thalinger, Staff Software Engineer, Twitter, Inc.\n\nRunning Twitter services on Graal has been very successful and has saved Twitter a lot of money on data center cost. But the company would like to run more efficiently to reduce costs even more. Who wouldnâ€™t? To do this, Twitter is using its machine learning framework, called Autotune, to tune Graal inlining parameters. This session shows how much performance improvement it got by autotuning Graal."
