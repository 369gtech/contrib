description: "Keep Ruby Weird 2018 - Using psql to \\watch Star Wars And other silly things! by Will Leinweber\n\nWill doesn’t really want to think about how long he’s been working with Postgres. He is currently working on horizontally scalable Postgres at Citus Data, and before that was a principal member of the Heroku Postgres team. Please don’t try to right-click and steal the source for his WebSite bitfission.com."
