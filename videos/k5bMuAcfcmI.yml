description: "We're living in a more and more connected world. Everyone who has a social network account has potentially a large number of \"connections\". In the past, relational databases help us to \"define\" relationships between entities, nowadays graph databases help us to \"find\" and \"discover\" relationships between connected entities we don't even know they exist.\n\nIn this talk, we'll have a look at property graphs and see how Apache TinkerPop and its Gremlin graph query language can help you to extract and discover relations from your data lake. For each example we'll provide side by side the Gremlin query, SQL query and corresponding functional code\n\nDuyHai DOAN is an Apache Cassandra Evangelist at DataStax and committer for Apache Zeppelin. He spends his time between technical presentations/meetups on Cassandra, coding on open source projects like Achilles or Apache Zeppelin to support the community and helping all companies using Cassandra to make their project successful. Previously he was working as a freelance Java/Cassandra consultant."
