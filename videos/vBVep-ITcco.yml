description: "Panellists:\nPat Kua (Seasoned Technology Leader)\nNelida Velazquez (Senior Developer, DetroitLabs)\nJack Franklin (Software Engineer, Google)\nSuman Roy (Director, Engineering, NYT)\n\nDealing with legacy systems is an inevitability, but when it comes to setting priorities it always seems to drop off the list; and when you’re adding the complexity of completely retiring a system, it can feel like a problem that’s always just out of reach. \n\nAnd retiring a legacy system comes with its own challenges. Mapping interdependent structures, working with outdated and unreliable code, and ensuring that disruption is kept to a minimum during the switch over are all vital to a project’s success. \n\nIn this session will be thinking about deprecation, how to manage the project of retiring a legacy system, and outlining technical approaches to ensure that systems are retired in a smooth, controlled manner."
