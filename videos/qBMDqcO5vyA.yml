As learning programming basics have become more online based than physical, how do we account for the ease acquisition. How do you make learning a new language exciting to all developers?\n\nIn my talk, I would like to introduce you the core principals I have learned in creating exciting documentation and online developer experience that enable all developers to be successful in the browser.
