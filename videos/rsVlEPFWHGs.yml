description: "We will take a closer look at the landscape after the crypto crash. By some called the most healthy thing that happened to the blockchain space. We will look at first successful crypto startups, who are getting traction and start to grow. At those who show a clear path forward for the next couple years. We will discuss highly experimental technologies that are just leaving laboratories to power the next wave of emerging products. \n\nThe speech took place on 9th May on Crypto & Security Stage during Infoshare 2019 in Gdansk, Poland.\n\n#ICO #Cryptocurrency #blockchain"
