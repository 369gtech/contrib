description: "Slides: http://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/cloud-native-security-rotate-repair-repave\n\nEnterprise software security traditionally resists change as a matter of unquestioned policy. Vulnerability is a function that changes with time. The probability of being exploited increases with the accumulation of long lived credentials and unpatched code. The question that must be asked is: how can a security strategy which resists change keep up with the pace of the modern threat landscape? This asymmetry in speed and adaptiveness only creates advantages for the attacker. What if the only what to increase security is to move as fast as possible? Continuously rotating credentials, patching systems, and rebuilding clusters to minimize windows of vulnerability decreases the threat profile in time and severity. This presentation will outline principles and practices of Cloud Native Security and how Cloud Foundry can be part of your strategy to increase velocity and security.implementation and scale it up in stages, splitting out backend resources and authentication to separate services.\n\nSpeaker: Justin Smith,  Pivotal"
