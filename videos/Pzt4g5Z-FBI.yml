description: "PyData DC 2018\n\nThe world wide web contains text in many languages and modern systems often cannot be restricted to a single locale. Being able to make use of the text in other languages requires a pipeline that can scale. We'll describe and demonstrate how we can create a streaming pipeline to consume, preprocess, and translate the streaming text.\n\n===\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
