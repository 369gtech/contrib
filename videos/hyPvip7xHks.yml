I used CircleCI prior to them becoming a sponsor and I love that their free tier is powerful enough for small personal projects, even if they are private.

It is insanely fast, because it only executes tests affected by your code changes and runs tests in parallel.

Most coding content out there focus on step-by-step tutorials. We think tutorials are too far removed from what everyday development is like. Instead, FFF has created a completely new learning environment where we grow from failure, by solving problems while intensively interacting with a live audience. \n\nTutorials try to solve a problem. Failing Together makes you grow as a developer and coworker.\n\n📹 Each show is recorded live on Twitch in a 2-hour livestream on Mondays. The host, assisted by the audience, is tasked to complete a programming challenge by an expert guest. Like in the real world, we often fail, and learn from it. This, of course, reflects what the audience identifies with, and is one of the most praised aspects of the show. \n\n⏯ On Fridays, an edited version of the show is adapted for and published on YouTube. \n\nContent Topics revolve around: JavaScript, Functional Programming, Software Architecture, Quality Processes, Developer Career and Health, Team Collaboration, Software Development, Project Management"
