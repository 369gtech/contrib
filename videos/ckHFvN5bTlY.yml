description: "How can you keep your systems safe from the next cyberattack?\n\nWe all want our applications to be secure, but code security is often an afterthought for busy teams. This can lead to serious problems down the line. But times are changing. Tech teams are now viewing app security as more than just a ‘box to tick’. So how can engineers prioritize security and protect their products?\n\nIn this panel, we’ll discuss why engineering leaders should view security as an integral part of an engineering org. The panel will look at how to deliver securely in distributed businesses, manage increased data and the ever-present threat of cyber attacks.\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\n- Assess security threats in an ever-changing tech landscape\n- Incorporate security practises early on in product development\n- Manage schedules for shipping products faster with higher security\n- Establish buy-in within your engineering org to prioritize security in all projects"
