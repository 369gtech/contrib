description: "Please Note: The audio was recorded over a phone line and is not HD quality. \r\nMaking the right choices leads us and our organizations to thrive. Many books and speakers wax poetic that the best ideas come from \"blue-sky ideation,\" but generating ideas is only part of the challenge of winning. While brainstorming generates lots of ideas, but you still have to discern the right choices to win.\r\n\r\nThe current economic situation means identifying, winnowing and making the tough choices to choose ideas that deliver immediate results. Organizations often avoid tough choices because they want consensus, immediate results, and to avoid political fights.\r\n\r\nThe opposite of whiteboarding, the MurderBoarding decision process ensures teams creatively generate many potential options before \"killing off\" options one-by-one until there is single best solution for a specific organization and situation. The result is the organization aligns to a common goal and takes on clear, achievable, and measurable goals. This session provides you with a framework for nailing the tough choices you need to make to win."
