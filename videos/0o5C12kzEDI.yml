Do they spike when you're updating your app or rotating your k8s cluster nodes?  Maybe you used to have this problem -- then you added some strange settings and it's mostly working now…    What most people need from Kubernetes regarding web-traffic is a repeatable but under-documented combo of esoteric, non-default options.    We'll walk through the basic needs of shaping traffic and apply that knowledge to the states of compute, rollout, and canonical networking we see with k8s.  Expect tidbits about CRI, CNI, Ingress, and the design trade-offs present in Kubernetes and its API's.    You’ll leave this session knowing how to keep your apps serving successful requests for a myriad of edge-cases.  \n\nhttps://sched.co/Uads"
