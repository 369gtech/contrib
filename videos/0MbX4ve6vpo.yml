recordingDate: 1609873269
description: "Talk \nContinuous integration is a key practice from DevOps that encourages frequent code check-ins and testing in a production-like environment. While continuous integration is typically associated with speeding up development cycles for software, it also provides a rigorous framework for automating analysis, modeling, and reporting data viz and statistical results that is desirable for open science.\n\nSpeaker \nDr. Elle Oâ€™Brien is a data scientist at Iterative, Inc. (the team behind DVC and one of the creators of Continuous Machine Learning (CML), an open source project for advancing DevOps practices in data science. She holds a PhD from the University of Washington and has presented about data science, DevOps, and scientific methods at more than 25 academic and industry meetings. Previously, she conducted research in computational neuroscience and speech perception, and worked as the Chief Scientist at Botnik Studios, an AI-comedy writing collective.\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
