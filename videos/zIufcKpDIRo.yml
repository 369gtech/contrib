title: 'Where iOS View Controllers (and Their Views) Come From'
recordingDate: 1337282383
description: "View controllers are everywhere in iOS programming; they are the basis of the dynamic iOS screen, making views come and go coherently along with animation, and taking care of rotation. But view controllers can be created in several different ways, and can obtain and configure their views in several different ways; this makes for a daunting combination of possibilities.\n\nJoin us for a live webcast presentation with Matt Neuburg, author of Programming iOS 5, 2nd Edition, and he will make it all perfectly clear with a live \"hands-on\" presentation.\n\nThe webcast is aimed at iOS programming beginners and near-beginners (or anyone who has been using storyboards to avoid grappling with view controllers directly). If there's time, we'll also talk about iOS 5's new support for custom container view controllers.\n\nAbout Matt Neuburg:\n\nMatt Neuburg started programming computers in 1968, when he was 14 years old, as a member of a literally underground high school club, which met once a week to do time-sharing on a bank of PDP-10s by way of primitive Teletype machines. He also occasionally used Princeton University's IBM-360/67, but gave it up in frustration when one day he dropped his punch cards. He majored in Greek at Swarthmore College and received his Ph.D. from Cornell University in 1981, writing his doctoral dissertation (about Aeschylus) on a mainframe. He proceeded to teach classical languages, literature, and culture at many well-known institutions of higher learning, most of which now disavow knowledge of his existence, and to publish numerous scholarly articles unlikely to interest anyone. Meanwhile he obtained an Apple IIc and became hopelessly hooked on computers again, migrating to a Macintosh in 1990. He wrote some educational and utility freeware, became an early regular contributor to the online journal TidBITS, and in 1995 left academe to edit MacTech Magazine. In August 1996 he became a freelancer, which means he has been looking for work ever since.\n\nHe is the author of AppleScript: The Definitive Guide, REALbasic: The Definitive Guide, and Frontier: The Definitive Guide, all from O'Reilly Media, Inc.."
