description: "A talk from Barcelona Ruby Conference 2013 (http://baruco.org)\n\nIt's not your fault. Code rots. We don't hold entropy against you, but we expect you to give a damn. This story is about code that brings new meaning to the word 'legacy'. The accidental discovery of this body of code provoked a moral crisis. I wanted to pretend I hadn't seen it, yet I couldn't justify tiptoeing quietly away. This talk examines the dilemmas we face when balancing our choices today with their cost tomorrow. It's not your fault. Even so, it is your responsibility.\n\nhttp://www.baruco.org/talks/here-be-dragons\n\nRecorded & produced by El Cocu (http://elcocu.com)"
