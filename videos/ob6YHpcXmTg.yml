description: "All I wanted was to add three extra words to Perl's syntax. How hard could that be?\n\nIn the end, it required:\n\n    * three years, 2.8 million lines of code\n    * five nested development projects,\n    * 3633 CPAN modules,\n    * 498405 unit tests,\n    * the four most perfectly obfuscated Perl programs of all time,\n    * multiple multi-layered multiple-dispatch systems,\n    * a 1011-line substitution statement,\n    * a 1194-line regex match\n    * an entirely new meta-meta-metasyntax\n\nThis is a tale of madness, obsession, and coding extremity.\nThis is a journey to the very heart of Perl...and beyond.\nIn three little words.\nDamian Conway is a 52-year-old Australian male, wanted in connection with various outrages and atrocities committed on CPAN over the past two decades, as well as numerous assaults on the sanity of Perl audiences across four continents."
