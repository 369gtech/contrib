description: "Unit testing is an important part of writing quality software. It is also a controversial and somewhat difficult topic to get started in. In this video, we walk through why we would use unit testing, what a unit test is, how to create a test, and how to deal with some of the more difficult situations.\n\nAlong the way, we will cover best practices, the pitfalls to avoid, and how to write more testable code.\n\nThis video uses XUnit instead of NUnit or MSTest based upon my preference. However, the techniques taught will apply to other test types.\n\nNewsletter signup (with exclusive discounts):  https://signup.iamtimcorey.com/ (your email will be kept safe and you will not be spammed).\nSource Code (and homework): https://leadmagnets.app/?Resource=IntroToUnitTesting"
