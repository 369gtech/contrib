description: 'Perimeter defenses are holding an important role in computer security. However, when we check the method of APT groups, a single spear-phishing usually enough to gain a foothold on the network. Therefore, red teams are mostly focused on "assume breach" type of scenarios. In these scenarios, testers need to use a post-exploitation framework. Besides that, testers also need to hide the server-agent communication from NIDS (Network Intrusion Detection Systems). In this session, we will discuss one of the most famous post-exploitation tool, Empire''s situation against payload-based anomaly detection systems. We will explain how to normalize Empire''s traffic with polymorphic blending attack (PBA) method. We will also cover our tool, "firstorder" which is designed to evade anomaly-based detection systems. firstorder tool takes a traffic capture file of the network, tries to identify normal profile and configures Empire''s listener in such way.'
