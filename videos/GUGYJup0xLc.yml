title: 'GopherCon UK 2018: Michael Hausenblas - Three Billy GOats Gruff: A Dev''s Tale from VMs to Serverless'
recordingDate: 1535661928
description: 'As developers we’re dealing with an increasing pressure to deliver features ever faster. This talk will walk you through a number of development and delivery models for Go. We’ll be starting with the traditional binary-running-on-a-VM setup, then move on to container-based development and further on to the serverless/Function-as-a-service model using AWS Lambda and Apache OpenWhisk on Kubernetes. We’ll be using the same codebase, effectively starting with a monolith, breaking in down into (containerized) microservices and further on breaking it down to a dozen functions. For each of the development and deployment models we’ll discuss pros and cons and trying to determine their respective sweet-spot. This is a hands-on, minimum-slides session.'
