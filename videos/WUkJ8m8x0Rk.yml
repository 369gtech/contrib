description: "When we build a React Native project, we often start by deciding whether to go with native navigation (react-native-navigation) or JS navigation library (react-navigation).\n\nIn this talk, we will explain the differences between native and js based navigators, when to choose native over js, and why at Wix Engineering we decided to develop a native navigation solution for RN.\nWe will also cover the main concepts of react-native-navigation and its API, so after this talk, you will be able to easily use it in your next project.\n\nFor more engineering updates and insights:\n\n* Follow us on Twitter → https://twitter.com/WixEng\n* Subscribe our monthly newsletter →  https://www.wix.engineering/subscribe\n* Visit our blog →  https://www.wix.engineering/blog\n* Follow our Medium publication →  https://medium.com/wix-engineering"
