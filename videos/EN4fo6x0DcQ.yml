title: 'DataFX: The Best Way to Get Real-World Data into Your JavaFX Application'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433506121
description: "The real value in most client-oriented business applications is the data sitting on remote servers and cloud systems. Unfortunately, retrieving and displaying this data is an exercise left to the developer, and it must be done (correctly!) before end users can interact with it. Fortunately, the open source DataFX framework aims to simplify this by enabling JavaFX developers to easily retrieve data from a variety of sources in several formats and rapidly integrate it with JavaFX components (such as TableView), using typical JavaFX patterns. This session introduces the free and open source DataFX project, gives practical advice for using it, and provides insight into future plans for this project.\n\n\nAuthors:\nJohan Vos\nJohan Vos started to work with Java in 1995. He worked on the Java Linux port with the Blackdown team. He has been doing Java consulting and development for a number of customers in completely different areas. Over the years, he has been active in a number of Java-based community projects, e.g. OSGi, the Glassfish project and JFXtras.org.\nWith LodgON, the company he co-founded, he is mainly working on Java solutions for social networking software. \nSince he can't make a choice between embedded development and enterprise development, his main focus is on end-to-end Java, combining the strengths of back-end systems and embedded devices. His favourite technologies are currently Java EE / Glassfish at the backend and JavaFX at the frond-end.\nView more trainings by Johan Vos at https://www.parleys.com/author/johan-vos\n\nHendrik Ebbers\nHendrik Ebbers is Java Architect at Canoo Engineering AG and lives in Dortmund, Germany.
