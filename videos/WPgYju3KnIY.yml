description: "Domain-Driven Design Europe 2016 - Brussels, January 26-29 2016\nhttp://dddeurope.com - https://twitter.com/ddd_eu\nWe often speak of software as possessing properties, usually expressed using –ilities (extendibility, reusability, scalability), or by adherence to some principle (separation of concerns, don’t repeat yourself), or defined by metrics (coupling, cohesion) or even using broad, subjective characterizations as “fragile”, “robust”, “clean”, etc.\n\nThis is also true for physical materials: we define a material as a conductor, or an insulator; as being compressible or incompressible; etc. However, a property in physics is always defined in relationship to a (generalized) force applied to the material. We speak of conductors and isolators because we have a notion of electrical current and electric potential difference; we speak of compressibility because we have a notion of compression; etc.\n\nIn software, we speak of properties like “extendibility” or “fragility” but we’re left to vernacular usage or arbitrary definitions, because the forces at play are unknown and undefined. Yet there are forces acting on our software. We just don’t know them well and we don’t use them well when we design software structures.\n\nThis talk is about a possible theory of forces in software, and how it can inform the way we design, the way we talk about design, the way we think about design. While it is necessarily broad and introductory, it also gives a few specific examples in relationship with known principles and a more precise characterization of some –ility, together with a few new concepts that form the basis of the theory itself."
