But what actually happens when the little-fish company is acquired by a bigger-fish company? How hard is it to bring two company cultures together and ensure that the newcomers feel welcomed and accepted? In this talk, Paula Kennedy, former Chief Operating Officer of CloudCredo will talk about how the initial fears of acquisition and cultural change were supplanted by the realisation of being welcomed by family."
