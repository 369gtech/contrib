title: 'The Tales of Event-Driven Told by a Spring Developer'
language: English
recordingDate: 1601027633
description: "Developers have long employed message queues to decouple subsystems and provide an approximation of asynchronous processing. However, these queuing systems don’t adequately deliver on the promise of event-driven architectures and often lead to the usage of anti-patterns. The events are carrying both notification and state, which enables developers and data engineers to design and develop to event-driven systems. Developers benefit from the asynchronous communication that events enable between services, and data engineers benefit from the integration capabilities.\n\nIn this talk, Viktor will explain the concepts of events, their relevance to software and data engineers, as well as their power for effectively unifying architectures. You’ll learn how stream processing makes sense in microservices and data integration projects. The talk concludes with a hands-on demonstration of these concepts in practice, using a modern toolchain: Kotlin, Spring Boot, Ktor, and Apache Kafka!\n\nViktor Gamov: Developer Advocate, Confluent\n\nSlides: link to come"
