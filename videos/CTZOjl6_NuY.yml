description: "\"You Deserve Nice things\" is an exploration of extending system classes in Swift. Class extensions are a first class feature of Swift's and by using them, we can gain more expressive, more powerful, and easier to read code. Sometimes, though, it's hard to decide what logic belongs in an extension and what logic belongs in a separate type.\n\nSoroush will provide a framework through which you'll be able to understand when and why to extend system classes to add new functionality. He'll also give a few examples of useful extensions that you should add to your projects today.\n\nKey takeaways\nYou will learn when to extend classes in Swift\nYou will learn what rules to follow to decide how to extend classes\nYou will learn why Apple doesn't include these niceties for us\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
