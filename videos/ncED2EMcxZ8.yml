description: "Machine Learning the Kubernetes Way - Ania Musial & Keith Laban, Bloomberg \n\nThe Bloomberg Professional Service (aka \"the Terminal\") provides data, analytics, news, information and communication to professionals in business, finance, government, and philanthropy. Through our internal machine learning platform, Bloomberg is applying advanced AI and GPU-accelerated compute to dozens of domains such as NLP, computer vision, time-series analysis and personalization.    In this talk we'll discuss how we adapted Kubernetes to support a diverse set of machine learning workloads; how an ecosystem of data connectors enables rich collaboration; how we address multi-tenancy, data security and privacy; and finally, how we support heterogenous compute requirements and hardware acceleration. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/GrSJ"
