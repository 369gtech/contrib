description: "Many tools and processes go into modern front-end development: from component development to design and data fetching to testing and more. How does Stripe make these all work together? Join Paul Asjes from Stripeâ€™s engineering team for a talk on how to make all these components and processes work in a way that makes the modern front-end greater than the sum of its many parts.\n\nPaul is a developer support engineer at Stripe by day and a sleepy one at night. He helps companies get set up with Stripe in a variety of languages, but JavaScript is his favourite. He's written a book on Slack bots and likes to spend time underwater when not running around Singapore eating all the things.\n\nThis talk is sponsored by Stripe - https://stripe.com\n\n\nJSConf.Asia - LASALLE College of the Arts, Singapore - 15 June 2019\n\nSource: https://2019.jsconf.asia/\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
