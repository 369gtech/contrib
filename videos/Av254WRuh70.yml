title: 'Cogynt: Flink without code - Samantha Chan'
recordingDate: 1588067366
description: 'In our data-driven world, the need for speed has never been greater. The advent of Flink has no doubt paved the way for faster and more efficient data delivery solutions; however, it is not without its costs. The amount of time, talent and resources required to effectively manipulate streams and conduct analysis at scale is far from trivial, and it can be especially daunting to the uninitiated or technically challenged. In an effort to make scalable stream processing more readily accessible to the world, Cogility Software created Cogynt: a zero-coding analytics platform for the masses. Cogynt enables engineers and non-engineers alike to manipulate and analyze streams on an abstracted level, while leveraging the power of Flink and Kafka under the hood to declaratively build complex Flink jobs. Shielding the analyst from low-level system configuration and programming API’s lends itself to creating an environment where analysts can focus on what’s most important to their businesses – the data. This session will demonstrate, from a data science perspective, how Cogynt can easily do almost anything Flink users can do with code, and more!'
