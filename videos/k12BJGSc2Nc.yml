description: "http://www.Cppcon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2015\n—\nEvery day we develop software that relies on math while we often overlook the importance of understanding the implications of using our IEEE floats. From the often cited “floating point error” to unstable algorithms, this talk will explain the importance of floats, understanding their storage, the impact of the IEEE floats on math, and designing algorithms better. Finally, the talk will conclude with a quick case study of storing time for games and simulations.\n— \nJohn Farrier is a software engineer, researcher, and musician. He designs software architectures for military modeling and simulation activities. His projects support efforts across the U.S. Department of Defense ranging from lab-based experimental software to fielded software on live fire test ranges.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
