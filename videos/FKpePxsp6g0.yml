description: "SOA was yesterday, microservices\nare hot today, and nanoservices are the next big thing.\nHowever you call your services, with Java 8 and Java EE 7 you can delete even more code as it was the case with Java EE 6.\nServer side applications can be built faster, without any technical \"noise\", than ever before.\nIn this session I will build a few examples based on Java 8 and Java EE 7 and demonstrate some approaches of how to further rethink enterprise apps with Java 8 and Java EE 7."
