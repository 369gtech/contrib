It is used to safely and efficiently extend the capabilities of the kernel without requiring to change kernel source code or load kernel modules. However, BPF programming is far more strenuous than it may sound, which can be discouraging for many. In this talk, Wenbo will share with you the past, present and future of BPF, and some tips and tricks to developing BPF tools using the libbpf library."
