description: "JMS 2.1, the next version of this popular messaging API, will be released as part of Java EE 8. Come hear how it will continue the ease-of-use improvements started in JMS 2.0 by providing a more flexible way of defining MDBs and even closer integration with CDI, and get a first peek at some of the other improvements proposed. There will be an opportunity to make comments and contribute to the development of these new features. This session also reviews the new features of JMS 2.0, which is now supported by the latest versions of many app servers and messaging providers.\n\nSpeaker:\nNigel Deakin, Principal Member of Technical Staff, Oracle\nNigel Deakin is specification lead for JMS and a principal member of technical staff at Oracle, working on the development of the WebLogic and GlassFish application servers.
