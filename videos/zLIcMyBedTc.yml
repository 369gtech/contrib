description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nLessons Learned: Four Years with Emissary-ingress and Envoy - Flynn, Ambassador Labs\n\nThe Emissary-ingress (née Ambassador API Gateway) project got its start in 2017, with the stated goal of making it easy for developers to harness the power and flexibility of Envoy, in Kubernetes, without needing to be experts on either Envoy or Kubernetes. Realizing that goal has been quite a journey: to bring Envoy to non-experts, the Emissary-ingress team has needed to learn an enormous amount about how Envoy, from the basics of how it works and how to configure it to best effect, to how to build it, test it, extend it, and debug it. The experience has been by turns challenging, surprising, frustrating, delightful, and ultimately extremely rewarding: after four years, Emissary-ingress is a CNCF project running in thousands of installations around the world, bringing Envoy into production use for organizations that wouldn't otherwise be able to take advantage of it. Join Flynn from Ambassador Labs to dive further into the challenges we've seen, the many lessons we've learned along the way, and the things we think anyone working with Envoy should know."
