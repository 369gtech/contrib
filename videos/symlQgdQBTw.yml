description: "Join us for #RenderConf 2018: https://goo.gl/iXs1mJ\n\nSlides: http://bit.ly/render2017slides\n\nThe web platform is a wonderful playground of artistic and technical expression. The artists of the web often release amazing creations. As developers we can use a powerful language to bring our ideas to life.\n\nThis talk will go through creative coding, the demoscene, and a range of optimisation techniques. Then we will work on a little Audio-Visual demo together.\n\nI hope this will inspire new JavaScript artists and bring a dash of creativity to our every day problem solving.\n\nABOUT MATHIEU 'p01' HENRI\n\nMathieu 'p01' Henri is a JavaScript developer at Microsoft in Oslo, Norway. Previously he worked on the Opera browser. At night he is a creative coder & demoscene artist specialised in real time audio visual animations in a few hundred bytes for the web platform, PC and Atari ST computers."
