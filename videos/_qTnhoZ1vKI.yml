title: 'Oracle Code Innovate Retools, Embraces Virtual Format to Engage Cloud Developers'
language: English
recordingDate: 1638163103
description: "Jim Grisanzio from Oracle Developer Relations talks with Chip Baber from Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) about the Oracle Code Innovate Program. The conversation centers around building the cloud community by working directly with developers — that's side by side, hands on coding collaboration — on real cloud projects for customers.\n\nThe program, which started in 2018 with in-person sprints and moved virtual in 2020, uses a flexible Agile framework that spans a week of interactions, such as planning, training, ideation, coding, standups, demos, etc. What’s great about the program is that all sides learn — the customer’s developers get more direct experience coding in OCI, the customer’s executive management gets needed projects initiated that can be evolved to eventual deployment, and Oracle gets valuable engineering feedback that can help improve OCI. Plus, it’s fun. People at all levels who contribute to the project are really passionate about it. Listen in to hear why.\n\n#oci #cloud #foss\n\nPodcast\nhttps://oraclegroundbreakers.libsyn.com/oracle-code-innovate-retools-embraces-virtual-format-to-engage-developers\n\nChip Baber, Senior Manager, Code Innovate, Emerging Technology Oracle Cloud\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/chipbaber/ \n\nContact the Code Innovate Team\ncodeinnovate_us_grp@oracle.com \n\nLatest Video Review of the Virtual Code Innovate Program\nhttps://youtu.be/BcNuD8fm62k \n\nDozens of Videos on Oracle Code Innovate\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPIzp-E1msrZMCfSHbKgLK3KWsNM9JB9a \n\nChip Baber's YouTube Tech & Code Channel\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsnBif_-5JnA8Hzvp8e1bQ3fo6VEvYEB0 \n\nJim Grisanzio, Oracle Developer Relations\nhttps://twitter.com/jimgris \nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/jimgris/ \nhttps://developer.oracle.com/team/ \nhttps://oraclegroundbreakers.libsyn.com/\n\nPhotos from Live Code Innovate Events: 2018-2019\nOracle and GE Digital Bangalore https://flic.kr/s/aHsmtEb4XB\_\nOracle and McAfee Bangalore https://flic.kr/s/aHsmsufTbW\_\nOracle and Cisco San Jose https://flic.kr/s/aHsmBpBhVk\_\nOracle and Cisco Bangalore https://flic.kr/s/aHsmDKBpPY\n\n00:00 Intro\n00:40 Code Innovate goes virtual\n02:51 Keeping the in-person energy\n04:20 Getting started, structure, use cases, building, ideation, Agile\n11:48 Goal of Code Innovate, cloud co-development\n14:24 Examples of past events and tech used\n20:44 The learning goes both ways with the pull model\n23:16 Wrap, customer IP, tech videos on program"
