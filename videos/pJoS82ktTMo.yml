description: "How to validate architecture & design principles in code at compile time for .NET Projects\nA lot of work should be done before actual development could start. Conceptual models, different views on system – everything should be aligned with business requirement, but how to get confidence that implementation reflects architectural and design intentions? Code review is good approach, but it is time consuming, maybe something can be automatized? In my presentation I’m going to show you what can you do to save some time and not reinvent the wheel from the very beginning. And it’s not about simple code forms, that can be checked by StyleCop."
