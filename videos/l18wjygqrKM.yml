title: 'DEF CON Safe Mode IoT Village - Barak Sternberg  - Hacking smart devices for fun and profit'

description: 'Smart-devices are anywhere, connecting lights, AC, cameras and even heat-sensors. They present a weak spot in which hackers can hack and learn about internal network-configuration, change arbitrary controllers, and lead to high physical & software damage. In our scenario, thousands of HDL smart devices could have been exploited & remotely controlled in the wild. 4 unique vulnerabilities have been found and presented here - We show how they can be utilized by a sophisticated attacker to stealth-access smart-devices remotely, change, control and take advantage of their data. Also, we show how a full data-extraction of smart-devices managing accounts: private data and credentials could have been extracted as well. This unique attack scenario demonstrates the high-security impact of deploying IoT devices over any organization, especially when using dedicated IoT hardware and proprietary components which are interconnected and even remotely managed. A coordinated responsible disclosure was done and thankful to HDL responsiveness & approach - All was fixed.'
