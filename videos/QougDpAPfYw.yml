title: 'Episode #014 - Securing File Uploads'
language: English
recordingDate: 1461862095
description: "Be default, Refile does not have a way to secure file downloads. It relies on a generated hash that is unknown to users unless the page renders that image or has a download to that file. This is okay sometimes, however, protecting the file from being downloaded for those who have the URL is a bit more involved.\n\nhttps://www.driftingruby.com/episodes/securing-file-uploads\n► Visit the Merchandise Store - https://www.railsstore.com/\n► Uptime Monitoring with pingVerse - https://www.pingverse.com\n► Ruby on Rails Templates - https://www.rubidium.io\n► Subscribe to Drifting Ruby at https://www.driftingruby.com/subscription/new"
