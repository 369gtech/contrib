description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nMy Container Image has 500 Vulnerabilities, Now What? - Matt Jarvis, Snyk\n\nAs security becomes a bigger concern in the world of containers and Kubernetes, using vulnerability scanning tooling in our workflows is becoming increasingly common. But many container images can show tens if not hundreds of vulnerabilities, particularly if they are built using upstream base images from public repositories. If your container has a huge amount of vulnerabilities, what do you do ? Many of us will reach information overload when faced with such a list, and struggle to work out what actions we should take. In this talk, we’ll look at how container images are constructed, understand how potential vulnerabilities can get into our images, and explore how we can prioritize and remediate the vulnerabilities we find. Take control of your vulnerabilities !"
