title: 'YOW! Lambda Jam 2014 - Quicker Sort? Implementing generic linear time sorting - Declan Conlon'
language: English
recordingDate: 1421916015
description: "Established generic sorting is based on comparison and is known to have a lower bound of O(n log n). In a recent paper1 Fritz Henglein sets out an approach based on discrimination which has a lower bound of O(n), a fundamental improvement to the state-of-the-art. In this talk Haskell and Scala implementations of generic linear time sorting, based on this paper, will be presented. Performance measurement methodology and the initial, encouraging results will be discussed.\n\nAcademic research can often be intimidating, and bridging the gap between paper and implementation can seem like a big task. In this talk the speaker will share their perspective on this process.\n\nThe talk seeks to demonstrate that composition can yield fundamental insights, that research is more accessible than people may think, and to show interesting implementation details of the algorithm by comparing and contrasting Scala and Haskell.\n\nFor more on YOW!
