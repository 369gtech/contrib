Human intuition, judgement, and choices play a critical role in the answers we get from any data analysis. In this talk I will discuss the work of our group in studying human data interaction, including the tidycode package for analyzing R code, and experiments we are running in our massive online open courses to study the decision making behind data analysis. - Captured Live on Ustream at https://www.ustream.tv/channel/JUMjvCF2ucj"
