description: "Parsing and Generating KML with Google's KML Library\r\nMichael Ashbridge (Google)\r\n\r\nKML is a file format used to display geographic data in an earth browser, such as Google Earth, Google Maps and Google Maps for mobile. You can create KML files to pinpoint locations, add image overlays and expose rich data in new ways. This session will introduce Google's open source KML library for working with KML files. We'll explore its architecture and then show you how to parse and generate KML in your applications and scripts. Participants should have basic familiarity with KML."
