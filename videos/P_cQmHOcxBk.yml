title: 'What Can Tanzu RabbitMQ Do Better for You? with Gerhard Lazu'
language: English
recordingDate: 1604591765
description: "Friends advise friends to exercise extreme caution when running stateful workloads on Kubernetes. The best of friends however will help you run stateful workloads anywhere you want them to, and even containerize them for you. Let us show you what we have done to make it easy for you to run & operate RabbitMQ. We have solved many tough problems so that we have more time for what really matters: better conversations.\n\n---\n\nGerhard is a staff engineer at VMware where he works on RabbitMQ operations, resiliency & observability. Shipping straight into production and testing in production are some of Gerhardâ€™s favourites, only second to efficient infrastructure, monitored well. Driving for pleasure and taking as long as it takes to prepare the perfect cortado (scales and stopwatches are involved) are common pastimes."
