description: "Decades of exposure to sci-fi literature, movies and games have shaped our vision of VR, establishing certain expectations. In this session, we talk about chasing these fantasies and sculpting them into real products that children, grandparents, teachers, and gamers alike can comfortably enjoy. First, we introduce a framework thatâ€™s enabled us to turn out 60+ VR prototypes with weekly sprints. Next, we discuss a new design process for exploring, polishing, and launching consumer VR products while avoiding the pitfalls of a traditional 2D workflow. Finally, we conclude with tips for building your own VR design team.\n\nSee all the talks from Google I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/olw6kV\nWatch more Android talks at I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/Uv3jls\nWatch more Chrome talks at I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/JoMLpB\nWatch more Firebase talks at I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/JTH9Fr \nSubscribe to the Google Developers Channel: http://goo.gl/mQyv5L \n\n#io16 #GoogleIO #GoogleIO2016"
