description: "Google Tech Talk\r\nMarch 23, 2009\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nPresenters: Peter Sanders\r\n \r\nI give an overview of our current and future work on route planning. Based on contraction hierarchies, a simple technique that allows fast routing by exploiting the hierarchy available in the network, I explain how this can be used for static routing in continent sized road networks in about 0.1 ms, as a basis for transit-node routing that is another two orders of magnitude faster, and for computing distance tables, yet another order of magnitude faster. The latter method has applications, e.g., in logistics optimizations. Perhaps more importantly, we now generalize our techniques to more general settings including turn penalties, traffic jams, mobile hardware, time-dependent edge weights, public transportation, and multicriteria optimization."
