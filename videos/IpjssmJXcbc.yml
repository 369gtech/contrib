description: "PyData LA 2018 \n\nThis introductory workshop assumes no prior exposure to Julia. It should be accessible (and hopefully useful!) to scientists, engineers, and anyone else with technical computing needs. We will show you why Julia is special, demonstrate how easy it is to come to Julia from a Python background, and get you writing your first Julia programs.\n\n---\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
