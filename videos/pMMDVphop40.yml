description: "Git + Github revolutionized collaboration for developers, but for writers it doesn’t get better than Google Docs. But without WiFi, offline editors like Microsoft Word remain their tool of choice despite the explosion of feature-rich web apps, leaving them out in the cold when it comes to realtime collaboration.\n\nWith the help of Operational Transforms + Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types, peer-to-peer web apps can empower writers, musicians and artists to collaborate off-the-grid and climb up to the digital nomad’s ultimate dream: collaborative writing atop Half Dome."
