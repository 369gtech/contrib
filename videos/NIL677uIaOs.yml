description: "by Paul Masurel\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/K.3.201/deepdive_tantivy.webm\n\n\nTantivy is a search engine library,  akin to Lucene but for Rust. \n\nIn this talk, we will walk through the building blocks that make a scalable full-text search engine. While this talk will be centered on tantivy, most of the concepts introduced should apply to other inverted-list search engines like Lucene. \n\nRoom: K.3.201\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 12:30:00+01"
