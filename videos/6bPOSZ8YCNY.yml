description: "Lightning Talk: Cloud TPU? Don’t Mind If I Do - Nathan Murthy, Tesla \n\nApplication-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) have unleashed a wave technological of breakthroughs that have accelerated the pace of development and performance of products up and down the stack. Machine learning libraries like Tensorflow can benefit from these new tightly-integrated hardware architectures. Once exclusive to Google’s data centers, Tensor Processing Units are now available as cloud compute resources to everyone. At Tesla these breakthroughs offer potentially new avenues for our AI/ML projects to grow. \n\nTo learn more: https://sched.co/GrVP"
