recordingDate: 1542284861
description: "VR has finally left the trough of disillusionment! For some years now, people have believed VR to be a gimmick or an outright flop. If you look at it from the consumer side one can easily argue that we are still left in the trough.\n\nHowever, from an enterprise perspective there are numerous invaluable applications of purposeful VR implementations. Some examples of these, along with an outline of a possible future that includes VR and AR will be given during this talk.\n\nJaana Nykänen is the CEO of Divine Robot, who develops strategically purposeful VR and AR simulations to strengthen the business cases of their clients. With the help of gamification, the experiences become intuitive and immersive tools for training, marketing, design, innovation, and digitalisation. Jaana has a background in software engineering, and is a gamer at heart.\n______________________\nFoo Café is a meeting place for people with an interest in software development and IT. \n\nHere, user groups and partner companies find the perfect atmosphere for sharing knowledge and develop competence. \n\nFoo Café is open for everyone and is free to attend.
