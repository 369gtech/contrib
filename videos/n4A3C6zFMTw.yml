language: English
recordingDate: 1433260994
description: "Over the past several years, JavaFX has established itself as a great platform for creating highly interactive applications. JavaFX is supported on desktop systems and embedded systems, and the community stepped in and added support for tablets and phones. This session shows how you can run existing and new JavaFX applications on Android devices. It covers the full cycle from development and packaging to distribution and shows how you can leverage Android APIs in your JavaFX applications, thereby combining the best of both worlds.\n\n\nAuthor:\nJohan Vos\nJohan Vos started to work with Java in 1995.\n\nHe was part of the Blackdown team helping port Java to Linux. With LodgON, the company he co-founded, he is mainly working on Java based solutions for social networking software.\n\nBecause he can't make a choice between embedded development and enterprise development, his main focus is on end-to-end Java, combining the strengths of back-end systems and embedded devices. His favourite technologies are currently Java EE / Glassfish at the backend and JavaFX at the front-end.\n\nJohan is a Java Champion, a member of the BeJUG steering group, the Devoxx steering group and he is a JCP member. He is a co-author of the Pro JavaFX 2 book, and he has been a speaker at numerous conferences on Java.\n\nBlog: http://blogs.lodgon.com/johan\nView more trainings by Johan Vos at https://www.parleys.com/author/johan-vos-2\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
