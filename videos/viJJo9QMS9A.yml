description: "OSB Local - Start Coding in No Time - Christian Brinker & Yannic Remmet, evoila\n\nDo you remember tamagotchis? A little electronic pet you try to keep alive. Developers often face the same on their laptops. A little database they need for local testing. In CF you get it easy via the marketplace. Managed by the provider of the service. But locally? Here the developer has to install and keep the database alive. Wouldnâ€™t it be cool have the CF marketplace on your laptop? With Open Service Broker local the speakers present a solution to that. Accessible via command line, deployed locally and easy to use. So getting a new database for development gets a no-brainer.\n\nhttps://cfseu18.sched.com/event/FRyq/osb-local-start-coding-in-no-time-christian-brinker-yannic-remmet-evoila"
