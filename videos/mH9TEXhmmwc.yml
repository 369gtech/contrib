description: "With traditional software unit tests, there's never a guarantee that an application will actually function correctly in the production environment. And when you add microservices, remote resources that are accessible over a network, into the mix, testing is more tricky. To make things even harder, microservices typically need to collaborate with additional network-based microservices, making testing even more challenging.\n\nIn this session you'll learn test strategies that solve the most common issues you are likely to encounter when writing tests for microservices architecture. Also you'll learn how tools such as Arquillian, JUnit, Docker or techniques suck as service virtualization or consumer-driven testing can help you on this task.\n\n MicroServices    testing    Continuous Delivery  \n# Alex Soto\nAlex is a software engineer at Red Hat. He is a passionate of Java world, software automation and he believes in the open source software model.\n\nAlex is the creator of NoSQLUnit project.
