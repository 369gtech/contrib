description: 'Codemotion Milan 2015 - Gianluca Varisco - DevOoops (Increase awareness around DevOps infra security) - DevOps is increasingly blending the work of both application and network security professionals. In a quest to move faster, organisations can end up creating security vulnerabilities using the tools and products meant to protect them. What happens when these tools are used insecurely or - even worse - they are just insecure? Technologies discussed will encompass AWS, Puppet, Hudson/Jenkins, Vagrant, Docker and much, much more. Everything from common misconfigurations to remote code execution.'
