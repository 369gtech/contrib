title: 'Reactive Streams principles applied in Akka Streams by Eric Loots'
language: English
recordingDate: 1478870255
description: "In this talk we’ll have a look at Akka Streams and its relation to Reactive Streams, a standard for asynchronous stream processing with non-blocking back pressure. We’ll see how Reactive Streams principles enable the building of highly responsive applications that adapt to load changes and that are resilient to failure. Real-life scenarios will be shown where applying so-called back-pressure keeps systems fast and healthy at the same time.\n\nEric Loots is a Scala & Akka champion, teaching courses on these topics across the world for Lightbend, his employer. Having started programming in various machine languages some odd 35 years ago, subsequently passing via C and Java to Scala and Akka, Eric’s glad with the coming of age of Reactive programming.\n\n[XFU-9980]"
