Have you already considered implementing a state machine based approach for your app? Are you afraid how this architecture scales in the real world? Have you ever wondered how to deal with in-app navigation, A/B tests, animations or ultimately how to test and maintain such architecture efficiently? In this talk we start where other introduction talks end. We will share our knowledge and learnings about the state- machine- based architecture we use in our app that is used by millions of users."
