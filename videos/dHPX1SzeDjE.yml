description: "Coding katas are a way that programmers can kick the tires of their programming languages, paradigms and practices. Typically anchored in a TDD cycle, katas are typically simple problems that give programmers the opportunity to exercise deliberate practice and explore different approaches, whether programming style, pair programming or test-first programming.\n\nBut the simplicity can be deceptive, with many programmers tiring of these katas too soon, missing out on some of the more mind-bending and paradigm-expanding opportunities on offer. \n\nThis session will pick on a couple of katas and dig deeper into TDD, lambdas, language(s), (dys)functional programming and Alcubierre drive.\n\n// This talk was given by Kevlin Henney at SC London 2017, a conference dedicated to Craftsmanship values, XP practices & clean code.
