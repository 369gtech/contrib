It continues to deliver better and simpler features than were previously available. How can we help most C++ programmers get the improved features by default, so that our code is better by upgrading to take full advantage of modern C++?\n\nThis talk continues from Bjarne Stroustrup’s Monday keynote to describe how the open C++ core guidelines project is the cornerstone of a broader effort to promote modern C++. Using the same cross-platform effort Stroustrup described, this talk shows how to enable programmers write production-quality C++ code that is, among other benefits, type-safe and memory-safe by default –  free of most classes of type errors, bounds errors, and leak/dangling errors – and still exemplary, efficient, and fully modern C++.\n\nBackground reading: Bjarne Stroustrup’s 2005 “SELL” paper, “A rationale for semantically enhanced library languages,\" is important background for this talk.\n--\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
