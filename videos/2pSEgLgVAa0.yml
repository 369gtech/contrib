description: "Most programmers think architecture means combining a set of tools. They take frameworks like Hibernate, combine them with Spring and Struts, they deliver on Velocity templates and voil√°, there is your architecture. Their applications reflect this way of thinking. They are built around these tools and they are organized in structures to satisfy the rules and conventions of these tools. Then programmers discover agile practices, principles, and patterns, and realize that many cool things can not be applied to their applications. They are reluctant to change the architecture because they don't know what to replace it with.\nIn this talk we will learn how to identify the architecture issues, what are the most important agile practices trying to tell us, and how to pull in existence an architecture that can accommodate practices like TDD and Unit Testing, respect the SOLID principles, and rely on basic design patterns.\nTakeaways:\n* architecture smells\n* main technical agile practices\n* concepts of clean architecture"
