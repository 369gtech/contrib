In addition to the invaluable training, ng-conf will deliver a premier conference experience for attendees, providing opportunities to network with other developers, relax at social events, and engage in some of the unique entertainment opportunities available in Utah.\n\nThe community has shaped Angular, there is no doubt about it. As the Angular project matured the community as well as the core team evolved with the project. The goal of this talk is to revisit the origins of Angular as well as look into the future and seed ideas about how the core team and the community could work better together in the future. This session will also cover Angular and new web standards"
