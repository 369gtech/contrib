description: "The new wave of regulations tend to ease the availability to various cost-less and user centric financial apps. Some of the apps will benefit with premium models which are tightly coupled with the need for a better banking in the digital era. By using it wisely and with innovative mind-set, PSD2 equally opens doors for new products and offerings for Banks, Financial companies, Fintech and TPPs. \n\nMiroslav Stojmanovski, Software Architect, Fintech enthusiast, Technology evangelist at Seavus.
