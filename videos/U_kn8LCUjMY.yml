title: 'Customizing Qt to create first class graphical experiences on highly customized hardware'
recordingDate: 1569487725
description: "- Andreas Aardal Hanssen\n\nAt Cisco's Webex Devices group in Lysaker, we specialize in creating highly customized embedded devices for video and collaboration, and sophisticated software running on our these devices. As we battle thermal, power and performance constraints, we keep finding ourselves having to use our hardware in unexpected ways. Being able to customize all aspects of the hardware and software is critical to us.\n\nThis talk is about graphics; how we modified Qt to support highly performant graphics on hardware with no gpu or even framebuffer support, how we modified QtQuick to extend a single QML canvas across three 4k displays, and how Webex Devices' signature animated shade bob effect was implemented across our portfolio.\n\nSave the date for NDC TechTown 2020  (31st of August - 3rd of September)\n\nCheck out more of our talks at: \nhttps://ndctechtown.com/\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/"
