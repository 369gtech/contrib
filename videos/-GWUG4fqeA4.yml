description: "by Alexandre Brianceau\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/UB2.252A/configurations_prove_yours.webm\n\n\nHow can we be sure of the continuous configuration management proper operation? How to expose factual topic-related reports to dev, sec, managers, customers...? \n\nWe believe that, in order to deliver the full business and collaboration value of continuous configuration management, the solution needs to go further than simply applying policies - it must ensure configuration reliability; prove historized application and status; share it to other teams; notify of any drift with a relevant context. \n\nThis talk will present why and how we should be concerned about transmitting factual measures on infrastructure management to all parties involved. We will also guide you through the journey to include a full-fledged reporting feature in a configuration management solution. \n\nRoom: UB2.252A (Lameere)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 14:00:00+01"
