description: 'OpenAI recently published a fun paper where they showed using evolution algorithms to train policy networks to perform on par with state of the art reinforcement deep learning. In this talk weâ€™ll try to reimplement the main ideas in that paper using Neanderthal (blazing fast matrix and linear algebra computations) and Cortex (neural networks); make it massively distributed using Onyx; build a simulation environment using re-frame; and of course save our princess from no particular harm in our toy game example.'
