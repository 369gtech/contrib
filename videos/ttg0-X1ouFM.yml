title: '"A Comprehensive Strategic Plan for Copyleft Freedom on Linux" - Bradley M. Kuhn (LCA 2021 Online)'
recordingDate: 1612429986
description: "Bradley M. Kuhn\n\nhttps://lca2021.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/58/\n\nLinux is undoubtedly and unequivocally in the hands of more users every day than any of imagined.  Like most successes, we reached this outcome in a manner and form that no one anticipated: the most popular use of Linux is in devices that were once appliances and are now more capable general-purpose computers than the first machines where Linux booted.\r\n\r\nThe incumbent power structure of industries that control these appliances (now, computers) did anticipate how to thwart copyleft and software freedom.  We must respond with a comprehensive, strategic plan that prioritizes the software freedom of the individual users who own these devices.\r\n\r\nThis talk presents Conservancy's plan for success to defend and uphold copyleft and restore software freedom on the Linux-based devices that we use every day.  This work has never been easy, but is even more challenging that we face a savvy for-profit industry that would prefer users not have the right to modify and install the software on their devices.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
