It is simple to understand and once you do, using it in PHP and Drupal is very easy.\n\nIn this session, you will learn what Dependency Injection is and how it helps you structure your programs better. You will learn some very basic concepts like constructor injection with analogies and examples and then move on to see how it is done in real life.\n\nMost times, dependency injection is implemented with containers. You will learn how to use some simple dependency injection containers like Pimple in your PHP application.
