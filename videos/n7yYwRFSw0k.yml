description: "The impact of Meltre and Specdown on microkernel systems (*) (*) Deliberate misspelling of Meltdown and Spectre\nby Matthias Lange\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/AW1.121/meltre_specdown.webm\n\n\nIt has been one year since the first security bugs in modern out-of-order CPUs\nwere discovered. These bugs broke the fundamental mechanisms and assumptions\nthat were used to build operating systems. \n\nIn this talk we look at how these bugs affected the L4Re operating system. We\nwill present some of the mitigations that were implemented and show the\nperformance impact. We also discuss whether microkernel systems in general did\nfare better in dealing with this new class of security bugs. \n\nRoom: AW1.121\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 16:35:00+01"
