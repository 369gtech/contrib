description: "Wayne Piekarski introduces Audio on Android Auto. Google and Android Auto enable you to extend your existing audio applications for use in the car, using the Android 5.0 Lollipop media APIs. Your application and it’s audio content will run on the phone, but will be heard and controlled via the sound system built into the car. This DevByte from +WaynePiekarski covers how to expose the contents of your application’s audio library to the media APIs, such as song information and album artwork, and how to respond to requests from the buttons in the car. With audio for Android Auto, you can extend apps to the car in a way that’s more efficient for the driver. So drivers can stay connected, but with their hands on the wheel and their eyes on the road.\n\nAndroid Auto Audio documentation: http://developer.android.com/training/auto/audio/index.html\nCode sample: http://developer.android.com/samples/MediaBrowserService/project.html\nG+ Community: http://g.co/androidautodev\nWayne Piekarski: http://google.com/+WaynePiekarski"
