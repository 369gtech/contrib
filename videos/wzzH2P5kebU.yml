description: "Meet the team behind the app that helps Finland to track COVID-19 exposures throughout the entire country. A group of Finnish volunteers put their passion for technology to good use and built an app that enables their fellow citizens to track and report COVID-19 exposures in their neighborhood in real-time, helping them get back to a more normal life again. Thanks to Oracle Application Express and Oracle Cloud technologies, the app went into production just 10 days after the idea. See for yourself who these people are and what they have built. Get inspired by the story that made it throughout the Finnish and international news.\n\nRead the entire story of the COVID-19 exposure app over at https://blogs.oracle.com/database/post/covid-19-tracking-app-finland"
