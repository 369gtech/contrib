title: 'Try R: A Gentle Introduction to Using R with Clustering #rlang'
recordingDate: 1551146720
description: "R is the best open-source programming language in data science. The burgeoning community of R developers has contributed to tools such as the tidyverse (an opinionated collection of packages for data import, manipulation, modeling, and visualization), shiny (a package for building interactive web applications from R) and RMarkdown (a format for documenting and communicating analysis to stakeholders).\n\nThis talk will focus on exploring the powerful capabilities of R by walking through a raw dataset on a Harvard/MIT online course. We will go over all stages of data science in R: We will be importing data, cleaning, transforming, modeling, and communicating our results with an interactive web application. By the end of this talk, you will have been introduced to the abilities of R. The focus of this talk is not going to be to teach you the fundamentals of R, but rather to give you the tools that make R so amazing.\nPresenter: Jason Baik\n--\nIf you haven't already done so, please install R / RStudio beforehand.\nInstructions (Windows):\nhttps://medium.com/@GalarnykMichael/install-r-and-rstudio-on-windows-5f503f708027\nInstructions (Mac):\nhttps://medium.com/@GalarnykMichael/install-r-and-rstudio-on-mac-e911606ce4f4\nOnce you have these installed, I'd recommend installing the tidyverse, an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science (https://www.tidyverse.org/).\nIn your console, type\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\nThe dataset we will be working with is located here: http://bit.ly/harvard-data\n--\nCode & Supply is a community of software professionals supported by members contributing $10 to $60 per month.
