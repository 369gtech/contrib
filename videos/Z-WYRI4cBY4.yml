title: 'DEF CON 29 Aerospace Village - Leeloo Granger  - Evaluating Wireless Attacks on Real World Avionics'
language: English
recordingDate: 1630569696
description: 'In a nutshell, in this project we prove the critical vulnerabilities of GPS and ADS-B technologies which only had been theoretically discussed in the literature. To do so, we investigated the feasibility and accessibility of GPS and Mode S spoofing on an avionics lab – the Garmin’s Navigator GTN750 – and using two types of transmitters: the USRP B210 and Raceologic’s LabSat Wideband 3. We successfully spoofed the GPS position of the GTN750, as well as intruders on the Traffic detection system. Unfortunately, we were not able to attack the TCAS II. Our work shows the vulnerabilities of communication technologies that have a major role in the safety of an aircraft, hence attacks are a severe threat and all the more so if they are conducted using as few resources as we did.'
