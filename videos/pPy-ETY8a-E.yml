In this session, we'll have a look at how functional languages deal with error handling and how we can adapt those approaches in the world of Java with Vavr.\n\nSimply put, we'll see how can we avoid “throws” by using Optional, Try, Either and by leveraging type-driven-development in general.\n\nGrzegorz Piwowarek \nFrom @CasumoTech\nGrzegorz Piwowarek is a hands-on tech lead at @CasumoTech, a trainer at @bottega_it, a blogger at 4comprehension.com.\n\nHe was professionally involved in projects involving systems integration, image recognition, and recently in highly-scalable, distributed solutions.\n\nBesides software development, he is a professional yo-yo player and a guitarist in a progressive metal band - Visions of Tondal."
