description: "It’s been said that learning GraphQL will stand you in good stead for the next 10 years.\nWasn’t the same said for SOAP services? Didn’t REST destroy the WS-{Death}* and bring order to the galaxy? And just when we were convinced RPC was the path to the Dark Side, Google caused a disturbance by producing gRPC.\nConfused as to what to use? Well, worry not, help is at hand. Backed by almost as many years experience as Yoda, we’ll teach you in the many ways of services.\nYou’ll graduate with an understanding of the dark and light of each approach and be firmly on the path to enlightenment."
