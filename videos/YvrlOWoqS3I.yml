description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nNew Paradigms for the Next Era of Security - Sounil Yu, Cyber Defense Matrix \n\nAs we enter the 2020s, we should expect to see attackers refine and mature their techniques to drive outcomes that result in the *inability* for us to recover from an attack, i.e., irreversible attacks. We are already seeing evidence of this now through ransomware and permanent denial of service attacks. In these scenarios, the old security paradigm of confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) no longer applies. Instead, we need to consider design patterns that follow new paradigms for the next era of security: distributed, immutable, and ephemeral (DIE). This session articulates the compelling need for us to consider new, business-aligned design patterns leveraging capabilities from the CNCF landscape that enable us to have systems that are fully resilient against destructive/irreversible attacks and why we need to seriously consider pivoting to this approach as soon as possible. \n\nhttps://sched.co/aO3g"
