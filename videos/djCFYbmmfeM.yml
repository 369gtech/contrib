description: "Don't forget to check out our links below!\nhttps://ndcporto.com/\nhttps://ndcconferences.com/\n\nMicroservices should be autonomous and independent, but what happens when your business domain doesn’t allow it, and you need to get data from other microservices? You’ll soon realize that simple HTTP calls are not enough anymore, or that your app is more brittle than ever and then you switch to messaging. With messaging or RPC you need to have a different mindset and be willing to embrace new challenges.\n\nIn this session, we’ll explore different ways of getting data from one ‘micro-service’ to another and while doing that we’ll talk about the benefits or the drawbacks of choosing an approach or another, from the architect's perspective."
