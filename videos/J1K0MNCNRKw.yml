title: '"It''s All About Timing" - Dave Chinner (LCA 2020)'
recordingDate: 1579132603
description: "Dave Chinner\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/44/\n\nBefore you can run a timed motorsport event, you have to have a timing system. But what do you do when the requirements for the timing system are severe enough that the only off-the-shelf solutions are so excitingly expensive the event does not have the budget to obtain access to such a system? You guessed it:\r\n\r\n\"Dave, can you build a timing system for us?\"\r\n\r\nIn this talk I'll walk through the challenges of designing and building a millisecond accurate timing system using open source sfotware and tools that has timing points far enough away that running cables is not practical, is in terrain that makes radio comms largely impossible, has to be set up on site in less than 60 minutes by one person and include safety systems integrated into race control protocols.\r\n\r\nThis timing system involves Beaglebones, designing and building custom hardware capes and the software to interface with them, as well as all the software to control the system and handle all the timing logic and safety procedure interlocks. It involves python, C, MQTT, wide area networking, highly accurate distributed time synchronisation and, of course,  fast cars.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
