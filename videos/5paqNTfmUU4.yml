description: 'Mixed Reality is not only thrilling for end users but also uncovers all new world of challenges and excitement for developers. Tools and libraries for holographic programming provided by Microsoft are intended to accelerate the process, especially for developers that haven’t been involved in 3D programming before. Visual Studio and Unity3D Editor enhanced with HoloLens emulator, and HoloToolkit form a powerful yet friendly environment for holographic development. Let’s explore them on stage and learn how basic development workflow looks like. Also, we’ll make use of HoloToolkit’s scripts and components to put together a simple app that will bring some holograms around us to life!'
