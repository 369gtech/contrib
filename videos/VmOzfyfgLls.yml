description: "Go to part 2: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShxK85WS5M8\n\nCloud Foundry, an open source project by VMware, is a multi-language,\nmulti-framework, and multi-deployment cloud. It lets developers focus on\nwhat is really important--their applications. Spring based applications\nare perfectly suited for Cloud Foundry which provides a set of tools to\nmake developing and deploying these applications a simple task. In this\nwebinar, we show what Cloud Foundry has to offer to Spring developers. We\nwill develop a few applications, show how to use a variety of services\nwith it, and scale it to meet changes in demand. After 60 minutes, you will be\nready to develop and deploy your own Spring applications to cloud."
