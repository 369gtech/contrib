It turns out that coding dojos can be used to learn almost any programming technique, and not only TDD. Its Randori flavor, where everyone collaborates through the same keyboard, is less known but features many benefits. Practiced regularly, it strengthens teamwork skills like active listening, egoless programming, code review, pair programming, mob programming and coding conventions.\n\nIâ€™ll quickly explain how to setup your own Randori in order to improve your team on all these aspects.\n\nPhilippe Bourgau \nFrom Murex\nSustainable productivity coach and developer.\n\nI help development teams to achieve sustainable productivity by adapting eXtreme Programming to their context and special difficulties.\n\nI am currently technical coach at Murex."
