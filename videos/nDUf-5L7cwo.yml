description: "by Joshua Schmid\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/H.1308/ceph_deepsea.webm\n\n\nCeph is a highly distributed software-defined storage solution. It provides allows you to store and access your data via interfaces for block, file and object storage. It aims primarily for completely distributed operation without a single point of failure, while being scalable to the exabyte level.\nDeployment and management  of a cluster not rarely consisting of hundreds of nodes can be a challenge. That's why we, at SUSE, provide a salt based tool called 'DeepSea' that tries to help you manage your cluster with ease. We designed our product with scalability in mind so that our users don't have to care about the size of their data-center but can concentrate on the important tasks.\nThis Talk will give a short introduction to DeepSea and highlight the new features we added.
