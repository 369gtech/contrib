Frontend Engineer at Shopee. I like to create bugs and fix them. Recently I am trying to make YouTube video tutorials. Also, I am currently a maintainer of Svelte, hopefully it meant less bug for Svelte.\r\n\r\nAbout the talk:\r\nI understand that not everyone has tried Svelte, not everyone knows about Svelte. Instead of giving a high-level overview of everything Svelte, I am going to share 1 Svelte feature, and hope that gives everyone a glimpse of Svelte."
