title: 'Chris Wilcox - Shipping your first Python package and automating future publishing - PyCon 2019'
recordingDate: 1557111000
description: "\"Speaker: Chris Wilcox\n\nOne of the best things about Python is the vast ecosystem of packages available on the Python Package Index. Shipping your first Python package can be intimidating. This talk aims to remove the mystery of Python packaging and enable you to share your code with other Pythonistas. We will also discuss more recent additions to packaging that can be used even if you are an experienced package maintainer. The latter portion of the talk will be dedicated to talking about how you can automate releasing via CI to make future updates a breeze.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2019 and https://github.com/PyCon/2019-slides\""
