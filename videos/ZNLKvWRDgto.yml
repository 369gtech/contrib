title: 'microXchg 2017 - Markus Krogemann: Who slowed us down? I want my monolith back!'

description: "Yes, a somewhat provocative title for a Microservices conference. However, it summarises a tale that I have now heard from more organisations than I had wished for.\nThis is not to say that Microservices tend to slow you down. Instead, it captures the realisation that Microservices require organisational and team capabilities, that may not always be in place and which are not readily available but rather limited in supply.\nHaving voiced these concerns, here is what I intend to put forward in my talk:An approach that has repeatedly worked for me and the organisations I worked with in the context of new projects (read: Startups).\n1) Start with a well designed monolith! The talk will provide more intuition on what characterises a well designed monolith.2) Given that you have built a well designed monolith, split it up into Microservices, as soon as you have evidence that the expected benefits pay back for any additional efforts required to make them work smoothly in your organisation. As soon as you have the evidence, but not before!\nThe changes required may be extensive and you need to account for them in order to avoid the slow-down that I mentioned earlier.They regularly involve changes to existing or altogether new deployment automations, monitoring infrastructures and debugging/tracing solutions. Also: developers will need to learn about technologies that may be new to them (Kubernetes, networking in containers, etc.).\nThe expected benefits of course are increased team autonomy and an ability to go faster, provided you manage to properly align the team efforts towards providing more / better value to your customers. And you will be able to reap them, if you don't forget to cater for the required steps in your organisational development.\nFinally, the talk will also highlight how Functional Programming and Elixir/OTP can help on your journey towards a well designed monolith."
