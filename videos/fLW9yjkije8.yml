description: "Everyone worries about performance but few of us have the time to truly understand it. Last year's talk exposed some puzzling results in Java 7 and 8, but the Java language, APIs, and JVMs keep evolving.\n\nIn this presentation, we'll take a look at some surprising and often unintuitive performance problems and solutions, but with an emphasis on comparing newer language features and APIs to their old counterparts.\n\nNot simply with the goal of determining which looping style is best, but also with the aim to better understand the complexity that lies inside the JVM.\n#Performance\n\nPresented by Douglas Hawkins\n\nSubscribe to our channel: https://youtube.pl/c/DevoxxPoland?sub_confirmation=1\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DevoxxPL\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/grzegorz.duda.official/\n\nJoin us also here:\nTechnology Radar Review: https://dworld.pl/radar\nDevelopers World Academy: https://dworld.pl/akademia\nDevflix: https://devflix.pl\n\n#Devoxx #DevoxxPoland #IT #Development #SoftwareDevelopment"
