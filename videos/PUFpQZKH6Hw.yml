description: "http://www.Cppcon.org\n—\nProgramming with less effort C++: Measuring the programming effort with metrics\n--\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2015\n—\nThe C++ language and libraries propose different ways to implement codes. For example, using explicit loops or STL algorithms to traverse containers and process data. C++11&14 bring also new features to the C++ language aimed at simplifying the writing of codes. But what is the gain we can expect in term of development effort when using these different possibilities and features ? or, as a developer may ask himself: Is it viable for me to spend some time learning new C++ libraries or standards to provide less effort/spend less time on my future codes ?\n\nBefore answering these questions, we must give a definition of the development effort, and define a way to measure it. Thus, we first propose to describe existing software metrics, from the simple Single Line Of Code (SLOC) to the more complex Halstead metrics, then to implement them in an automatic tool based on Clang tools, and finally to apply them on several codes to compare their respective development efforts.\n\nFirst results show that using modern C++ features like auto, decltype and lambdas help to dramatically reduce the development effort. These results may help to convince developers to use new C++ features, or to port their codes from old standards to new ones, or even switch from other languages to C++ !\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
