description: "Following on from the [Custom Vision – Machine Learning Made Easy](https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/XamarinShow/Custom-Vision--Machine-Learning-Made-Easy-with-Jim-Bennett)\_episode, in this show Jim looks at Custom Vision object detection. The custom vision service recently has been updated to include object detection, and this allows you to train the service to detect multiple objects inside an image with their locations, instead of just being a simple classifier. Jim walks through creating an object detection model, tagging regions in images that show the objects to be detected, then he builds a simple Xamarin app to use this to annotate a picture from his daughters toybox, naming all the toys it finds.\n\n**Show Links:**\n\n*   [Azure Custom Vision service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/csharp-tutorial-od)\_Tutorial\n*   Find James on:\_[Twitter](http://twitter.com/jamesmontemagno),\_[GitHub](http://github.com/jamesmontemagno),\_[Blog](https://montemagno.com), and his weekly development podcast\_[Merge Conflict](http://www.mergeconflict.fm).\n*   [Follow @JamesMontemagno](https://twitter.com/jamesmontemagno)\n*   Never Miss an Episode:\_[Follow @TheXamarinShow](https://twitter.com/thexamarinshow)\n*   Find Jim on:\_[Twitter](https://twitter.com/jimbobbennett),\_[GitHub](https://github.com/jimbobbennett),\_[Blog](https://jimbobbennett.io), Jim's book -\_[Xamarin In Action](http://xam.jbb.io)\n\n[Create a Free Account (Azure)](https://aka.ms/c9-azurefree)"
