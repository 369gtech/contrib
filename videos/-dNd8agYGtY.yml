title: 'gRPC Web: It’s All About Communication by Alex Borysov &  Yevgen Golubenko'
language: English
recordingDate: 1573162251
description: "gRPC is a modern high performance RPC framework backed by Google. It already adopted by other industry leaders and smaller players thanks to its performance, streaming capabilities, fault-tolerance and many more features. gRPC-Web, open-sourced last year and reached GA several months ago, helps to bring most of gRPC advantages to the modern Web.\n\nIn this talk we will cover how it makes backend-to-frontend collaboration easier, how it helps to avoid common pain points, and what its advantages are. As no tool and no approach are perfect, we will also discuss when it’s not a good fit. No matter if you’re a seasoned backend engineer, like Alex, or a frontend engineer building modern UIs, like Yevgen, this talk can be useful for you.\n\nDuring live demo session you will learn how you can start using gRPC-Web and why it can be beneficial for you and your project.\n\nAlex Borysov is a senior software engineer at Netflix. He is a clean coder and a test-driven developer with solid experience in building and running World-scale software systems. During his career Alex developed and run machine-learning infrastructure for payments fraud detection at Google; large-scale backends at Nest; microservice architecture for World-leading social casino games; core infrastructure services for a unicorn startup in Silicon Valley with 300+ million users. He has been a speaker on Java, open-source technologies and building reliable software systems at numerous conferences, including Devoxx, OSCON and others.\n\nYevgen Golubenko:\nSenior Front End Developer at Anomali. Resides in Silicon Valley. Passionate about designing and building scalable and resilient web applications with JavaScript. Interested in building seamless communication between backend and frontend with gRPC and gRPC-web. Contributed to successful Devoxx talks “gRPC vs REST: Let the battle begin” and “Break me if you can”."
