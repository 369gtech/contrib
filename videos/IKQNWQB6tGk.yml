description: "Spring Cloud Data Flow (SCDF) provides event streaming capabilities on a modern platform. A common challenge with event streaming systems is the ability to ascertain what happened with an event as it flows through the system. Due to the distributed nature of systems like SCDF sequential ordering and latency are a challenging problem. We’ve been able to combine Sleuth/Zipkin with SCDF to provide us with Latency and Event Tracing.\n\nHenri van den Bulk, Technical Director, Charles Schwab\nCraig Duero, Sr Staff Software Applications Engineer, Charles Schwab\nTom Martin, Lead Software Developer, Charles Schwab\n\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2017"
