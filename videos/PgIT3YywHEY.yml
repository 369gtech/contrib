title: 'NoSQL Means No Security - Philipp Krenn'
language: English
recordingDate: 1636452008
description: "New systems are always interesting targets since their security model couldnâ€™t mature yet. NoSQL databases are no exception and had some bad press about their security, but how does their protection actually look like? We will take a look at three widely used systems and their unique approaches:\n\nMongoDB: Widely criticized for publicly accessible databases and a common victim of ransomware. Actually, it provides an elaborate authentication and authorization system, which we will cover from a historic perspective and put an emphasis on the current state.\nRedis: Security through obscurity or how you can rename commands. And it features a unique tradeoff for binding to publicly accessible interfaces.\nElasticsearch: Groovy scripting has been a constant headache, but the new, custom-built scripting language Painless tries to take the pain away literally.\n\nPresented by Philipp Krenn\n\nSubscribe to our channel: https://youtube.pl/c/DevoxxPoland?sub_confirmation=1\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DevoxxPL\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/grzegorz.duda.official/\n\nJoin us also here:\nTechnology Radar Review: https://dworld.pl/radar\nDevelopers World Academy: https://dworld.pl/akademia\nDevflix: https://devflix.pl\n\n#Devoxx #DevoxxPoland #IT #Development #SoftwareDevelopment"
