description: "This video was recorded at virtual Code BEAM V Europe conference, which took place on 19-21st May 2021 - https://codesync.global/conferences/c...\n\nMore great virtual tech conferences - https://codesync.global​ \n\n---\n\nIf at first you don't succeed, try again smarter\nby Mike Wiliams ad Fre Herbert\n\nABSTRACT\nMike has seen it all begin, from the early Erlang experiments, down to its ban from Ericsson, until it rose from its ashes like a phoenix. Fred joined the community later, on the first hype wave following WhatsApp's early successes, slowly making a place for itself in cloud software. Together they've seen Erlang and other BEAM technologies successfully adopted, but also have seen them fail or be abandoned. In this presentation, Mike and Fred source from their experience to offer insights about the challenges you will encounter and mistakes that can be avoided when trying to push your workplace to use new technologies, where good tech is not enough to succeed.\n\n---\n\nSPEAKER - Mike Wiliams\nAfter leaving school in Wales, Milke worked as a school teacher in Malawi. He wasn’t a very good teacher, so he returned to Cambridge where he completed an engineering degree. He moved to Stockholm (with his Swedish wife) where he got a job working for Ericsson, the telecommunications giant. He had many jobs at Ericsson, starting as a hardware developer making him one of the few people who to design and implemented a computer from basic chips! Having developed a computer, the next stage was to program it, so he slipped into software development, eventually co-founding the Ericsson Computer Science laboratory. His principle achievement as co-inventor of Erlang was the implementation of the first Erlang virtual machine and the error handling constructs in Erlang's concurrency model. From applied research, he slipped into management of both small and large business units which developed and maintained software, both in Erlang and other technologies. Building and managing good teams for software development is, perhaps, the most important aspect for any non trivial development. It is what he is going to speak about.\n\nSPEAKER - Fred Herbert\nFred is the author of Learn You Some Erlang, Erlang in Anger, and more recently, Property-Based Testing with PropEr, Erlang, and Elixir. He co-founded and is a board member at the Erlang Ecosystem Foundation. He is a maintainer of Rebar3, and of various libraries such as recon, pobox, and so on.\nHe is a platform developer at Postmates, with a focus on learning from incidents and poking at various things. Previously, he was Systems Architect at Genetec, a company offering security video and IoT integration systems. Even earlier, he was a principal member of technical staff on the Heroku platform, worked in real-time bidding, and provided Erlang training.\n\n---\n\nCode BEAM V Europe\nWebsite: https://codesync.global/conferences/c...\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/CodeBEAMio"
