description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Chicago 2014\nhttp://gotochgo.com\n\nCourtney Hemphill - Lead Developer at Carbon Five\n\nABSTRACT\nCarbon Five has been using Agile XP from our very beginnings 14 years ago. Six years ago we started on a deep dive into Design Thinking inspired by collaborations with the Stanford d.school. We then extended those learnings, integrating Lean UX techniques, to help our clients focus the team's development power in a direction more closely aligned to a viable product market fit. Using two specific case studies and learnings from several other projects, I walk attendees through the weekly cadence that we use at Carbon Five during product development. This methodology and its activities establish a sustainable culture of integrated and invested teams that are able to communicate across disciplines in a meaningful way. The result of creating this type of culture via cadence allows our teams to put new features in front of users each week for validation and hence move the product closer to its market fit faster. \n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotochgo\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
