description: "These days, with so many tools, frameworks, and platforms on the market, just about everyone can build and deploy an API on the Web. And most of those APIs are pretty good. But they're rarely great.\n\nIt turns out Great APIs don't rely on any single format, library, or platform -- they are defined by key attributes and principles employed when the API is designed, built, and deployed. And these principles hold true whether your API is based designed to use SOAP, REST, CRUD, Reactive, or Graph/Query technology. Greatness is within reach for everyone."
