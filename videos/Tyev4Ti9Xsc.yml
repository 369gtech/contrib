description: "DOES18 Las Vegas - We were facing the scenario many financial services companies were facing, increased costs of delivery, falling revenues and increased regulatory demand. Instead of offshoring our technologists and exacerbating the problem, we used Lean Kata techniques combined with DevOps to work more efficiently.\n\nJP Morgan Chase: How Partnership with the Business Accelerated Releases in a Regulated Environment\n\n\nKenneth McLeish, Global Head of Equity Technology, JP Morgan Chase Asset Management\n\nDanny Myers, Head of Equities Production Management, JP Morgan Chase Asset Management\n\nKenny is the Head of Equities Technology at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. He has spent over 20 years working in finance technology and is passionate about using technology to revolutionize the business. He began his career at Barclays Capital as a developer where he spent 13 years building systems which evolved trading from traders in bright jackets writing trades on pieces of paper, to fully autonomous systems which carried out hundreds of millions of orders a day. From there Kenny worked for the Royal Bank of Scotland and then onto J.P. Morgan and enjoys working at the intersection where development, operations and business come together.\n\nDanny Myers is Head of Equities Production Management at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.\n\nHe is a lifelong technology enthusiast who started his career 14 years ago at Fidessa, firstly as an infrastructure engineer, followed by client facing roles implementing and supporting Fidessa trading systems.
