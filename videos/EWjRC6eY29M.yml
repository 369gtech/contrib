recordingDate: 1523445410
description: "Quit fighting with designers and clients over image restrictions; fight Drupal instead, and win!\n\nIn Drupal 8, core provides more image functionality than ever, but what if you want to go beyond the basics? What if you need more choices?\_This session will cover a variety of ways to bend Drupal images to your will, including:\n\n\n\nUploading and rendering SVG images via custom and/or contrib modules (and the security implications therein)\_\nCreating a bitmap fallback for your SVG field\nLetting content creators choose from multiple aspect ratios and/or image styles\nUsing contrib modules to preserve the most important parts of your image (and ways to get around it when that's not an option)\nSetting completely separate images as sources in a responsive picture tag\nRetaining your will to live (and your code functionality) when the Media module comes along and throws a wrench in everything we just spoke about.\n\n\nTo get the most out of this session, attendees should be familiar with basic theming and site-building.\n\nCode, config, and slides can now be seen at\_https://github.com/Abby805/d8-images."
