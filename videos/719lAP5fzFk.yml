description: "This video was recorded at CBL AMSTERDAM - http://bit.ly/2PPbW7J\nGet involved in Code Sync's next conference - http://bit.ly/2Mcm4aS\n\n---\n\nFROM LEGACY TO EVENT SOURCING\nby Ian Luites\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nEvent Sourcing, CQRS, GenServers\n\nTALK LEVEL: Intermediate\n\nABSTRACT\nA practical overview of the move from a legacy RDBMS system as source of truth; to storing core data with event sourcing supported by the Erlang runtime system. \n\n\nElixir comes with a great toolset to support actor like aggregations and command processing based on Erlang's lightweight processes and stable supervision. All the ingredients for a great setup.\n\n\n\nIn reality, it's not as easy as turning all mutations into an event and pushing them through a GenServer. Many practical hurdles were encountered. Obstacles like (long term) storage, scaling, regulations, but also conceptional changes. Changes like handling the disconnect between mutating = mutated.\n\nWe'll go through all of these, together with a very basic whats what and setup overview. The goal is not to show that event sourcing on BEAM is possible as a concept. (Many great talks have already shown this to be the case and have highlighted how to get started.) This is all about what you might run into after you get things started.\n\nSlides & full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/ian-luites/\n\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - IAN LUITES\nBeards, Code, Games\n\n\n\nMore on Ian Luites: https://codesync.global/speaker/ian-luites/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CBL AMSTERDAM 19\nCBL AMSTERDAM is powered by Code Sync.
