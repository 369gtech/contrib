description: "ะก++ is often employed because of its high performance, but you can't achieve maximum performance without thoroughly analysing the code of your application. Alexander will review the process and patterns of performance optimizations.\n-------\nHi! I am the software engineer from Russia. Currently I work at Intel and transform a large desktop profiler into a cloud service. My passion is writing fast and beatiful C++ code. :)\n-------\n\nC++ on Sea is an annual c++ and coding conference, usually held in Folkestone, Kent in the UK. The 2020 conference was moved to a virtual event due to social distancing requirements.\n\nProduced and Edited by Digital Medium Ltd: https://events.digital-medium.co.uk\nEnquiries: events@digital-medium.co.uk"
