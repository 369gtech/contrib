description: "Google Tech Talks\nOctober 9, 2008\n\nABSTRACT\n\nAlexei has successfully launched one balloon in Waterloo and is currently planning a mission between Canada and UK. Check out the amazing near-space imagery at 27km!\n\nFrom http://natrium42.com/halo/flight2/\n\n\"High altitude ballooning is an emerging hobby, since price of GPS and communications equipment has gotten quite low. It is an excellent hobby for people fascinated by space flight and telerobotics and has many learning aspects from systems design to electronics design to software engineering. There is also an exciting risk factor, namely, that you could lose your precious electronics if something malfunctions. In this project, many of my interest and knowledge areas came together.\"\n\nSpeaker: Alexei Karpenko\nAlexei is a student at University of Waterloo, Computer Science program. He is finishing his undergrad this year. His hobbies include flying remote control airplanes, small electronics and running his own online store (electrobee.com)."
