title: 'Nikita Prokopov - Client and server need to talk'
language: English
recordingDate: 1498048684
description: 'Every web application has a problem of passing data between a server and a browser. Client-server communication is a complex multi-dimensional problem with a lot of requirements, limitations, pitfalls and tradeoffs. Request-response model is simple to understand, but badly equipped for correct and error-prone communication. Server push through SSE/WebSocket is more modern but too low-level for any serious job to be done in it per se. In this talk, we’ll have a look at high-level libraries that try to approach client-server sync problem from different angles: by extending data model, through high-level APIs, by incorporating logs etc. We’ll explore possible problems, how they can be solved and what tools exists to do so. Keywords: CRDT, event sourcing, operation transformations, Meteor, Apollo, PouchDB, Firebase, Relay, Swarm.js, Logux.'
