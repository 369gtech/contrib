title: 'ITT 2017 - Matthias Rampke - Engineering culture at SoundCloud'
recordingDate: 1505375064
description: 'At SoundCloud, each development team operates the systems that they own, and they own the systems that they build. By eliminating dedicated Operations and SRE roles, our engineers have the autonomy they need to iterate fast, while maintaining cohesion and reliability in our platform. Learn how we organise deployment, on-call, shared infrastructure, and the role of core and infrastructure engineering.'
