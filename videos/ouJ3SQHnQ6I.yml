title: 'Claus Ibsen - Fabric8 Camel Microservices for Docker and Kubernetes'
language: English
recordingDate: 1464678155
description: "The so-called experts are saying microservices and containers will change the way we build, maintain, operate, and integrate applications. This talk is intended for Java developers who wants to hear and see how you can develop Java microservices that runs in containers. \n\nThis talk uses Apache Camel as the Java library to build microservice architectured applications. At first we introduce you to Apache Camel and show how you can easily get started with Camel on your computer, and build a microservice application that runs on CDI and Spring-Boot. \n\nThe second part of this talk is about running Camel (or any Java project) on Docker and Kubernetes. \n\nWe start covering the basic concepts you as a Java developer must understand about Kubernetes. Then we show how to migrate Java projects to build as Docker images and deployable on Kubernetes, with help from fabric8 Maven tooling. \n\nYou will also hear about how to make your microservices scalable and distributed by leveraging the facilities that Kubernetes provides for truly distributed services with load balancing and location independence. \n\nYou will also see how to manage your container using the Kubernetes CLI and the fabric8 web console. \n\nAt the end we have a bit of fun with scaling up and down your Camel application to see how resilient the application is, when we kill containers. \n\nThis talk is a 50/50 mix between slides and demo."
