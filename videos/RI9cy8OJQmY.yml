description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nObserve with Rust: OpenTelemetry and Tremor - Gary White Jr., Wayfair\n\nTremor is an early stage event processing system for unstructured data with rich support for structural pattern matching, filtering and transformation. Hundreds of companies around the world are using Rust in production today for fast, low-resource, cross-platform solutions. Gather round your screens and lecterns to hear the story of open source infrastructure helping a tech company sell furniture. We will show how it all happens with Rust and Tremor, and how we tune in and out of what matters; all with a lower cost of infrastructure and maintenance. Tremor users also appreciate the “software-like” syntax of querying through their systems, without sacrificing the performance of Rust. We're proud as supporters of Tremor to integrate OpenTelemetry into our codebase and feature set. We are excited to share details of this integration, how it works, and how we use it at Wayfair. Come to hear bad jokes and good technical content!"
