description: 'This is the tale of how we, at Balsamiq, rolled out our new web-app, from greenfield to production. A real-world application with real-time collaboration, built using Relay, Redux, React-rendered html emails, node.js, Redis, etc., running on AWS using Convox. Even at small/medium scale, if you''re serious about building a good product you will eventually have to build a complex stack. I will share the details of the services we use, how we make them fit together and what we learned in the process.'
