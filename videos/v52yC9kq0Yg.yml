language: English
recordingDate: 1608555630
description: "Message busses and queues are a powerful tool for communicating between applications. They are used extensively in microservices, but they can be useful in larger applications as well.

The best part is that even though we will be using Azure, it will only cost 5 cents per month to use these queues, even in production.\n\nSource Code: https://leadmagnets.app/?Resource=IntroToAzureServiceBus\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/IAmTimCorey\nNewsletter signup:  https://signup.iamtimcorey.com/"
