description: "Google Tech Talk\r\nJune 8, 2009\r\n \r\nABSTRACT\r\n \r\n\"If It Feels Good Do It\" : Using Neuromarketing to Go Beyond Click-Through: the Emerging Understanding of the Links Between Biometric Measures and Consumer Response to Media, presented by André Marquis.\r\n \r\nAdvances in neuromarketing over the past decade have moved the industry to a point where it is finally a practical addition to the marketer and product designer's toolbox. Mr. Marquis will demonstrate how tracking the second-by-second engagement of consumers interacting with a variety of media using biometric measurements including eye tracking, heart rate, breathing,\r\nGSR and movement allows companies to better understand how they cognitively process and emotionally react to visual information. He will present examples showing how advertisers, TV and Web companies have optimized their media to avoid confusion, break through the clutter and resonate with\r\nconsumers to maximize retention and avoid undesirable behaviors including fast forwarding and navigating away.\r\n \r\nAndré Marquis is currently the Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing at Innerscope Research which is dedicated to solving difficult market research questions by measuring and analyzing subconscious emotional responses to media. Andre has a long record of starting successful technology-based ventures with a particular focus on winning in markets where evidence-based decision making is critical, e.g. advertising, healthcare and pharmaceuticals.\r\n \r\nPrior to Innerscope, Mr. Marquis was the founder CEO of Amplyx Pharmaceuticals, an early stage drug development company that creates improved small molecule drugs. He was also the CMO of Log Savvy which developed the first massively parallel system able to analyze the huge amount of data required to understand \"Web 2.0\" emergent social activity. He was the COO of Chorus, a group inside Eli Lilly that has dramatically increased the efficiency of the Pre-Clinical through Phase II drug development through outsourcing as well as the CTO and Senior Vice President of Marketing at iPIX. iPIX was the world's largest manager of Internet visual content and created the technology and infrastructure for eBay's Picture Service. Mr. Marquis was a founder and Vice President of Marketing at Emptor which became Accept.com, a Kleiner Perkins, Benchmark Capital backed ecommerce company that was acquired by amazon.com"
