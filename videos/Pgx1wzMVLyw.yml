description: "Serverless architectures – where managed servers are provisioned and scaled on-demand, freeing up time and money to focus on code – are seeing increasing mainstream adoption, but enterprise-grade applications have additional challenges such as networking, security, durability, and workflow complexity.\n\nCome to this session to learn about the solutions to these challenges that Azure Functions, a leading FaaS (Functions as a Service) serverless compute service, has developed. We’ll explore identity integration, containerization, workflow management, and reducing cold start latency.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndcminnesota.com/"
