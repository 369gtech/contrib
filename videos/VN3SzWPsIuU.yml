description: "Recorded at SpringOne Platform 2016.\nSpeakers: Ben Hale, Paul Harris, Stephane Maldini \nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/designing-implementing-and-using-reactive-apis\n\nThe Java community is on the cusp of a major change in programming model. As the industry moves towards high-performance micro-service architectures, the need for a reactive programming model becomes clear. In this session, the lead developers of the Cloud Foundry Java Client will talk about what led them to choose a reactive API. Using that project as a lens, they'll explore how they designed and implemented this API using Project Reactor and what users will expect when using a reactive API. If you are a developer looking to provide reactive APIs, this is your chance to gain the experience of team building a large, production-ready reactive library."
