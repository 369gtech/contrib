title: 'YOW! Perth 2018 - Mark Hibberd - Failure and Change: Principles of Reliable Systems'
recordingDate: 1538697602
description: "As we construct larger or more complex systems, failure and change are ever-present. We need to accept and even embrace these tensions to build software that works and keeps working.\n\nThis is a talk on building and operating reliable systems. We will look at how systems fail, particularly in the face of complexity or scale, and build up a set of principles and practices that will help us implement, understand and verify reliable systems.\n\nMark Hibberd spends his time working on data and sustainability problems for Kinesis. Mark takes software development seriously. Valuing correctness and reliability, he is constantly looking to learn tools and techniques to support these goals. This approach has led to a history of building teams that utilise purely -functional programming techniques to help deliver robust products.\n\nFor more on YOW!
