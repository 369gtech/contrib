description: 'What would happen if one could communicate with holographic Augmented Reality spectacles with far away acquaintances as if they were in the same room? The hardware hacking team of TNG Technology Consulting GmbH has developed a software prototype for holographic telepresence for Microsoft HoloLens. Thus, similar to the Star Wars series, it is possible to project a person as a hologram into their own field of view. Within the framework of the lecture, ideas and concepts in the field of mixed reality are going to be introduced and explained, including a showcase and live coding.'
