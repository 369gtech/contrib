This is much more than “teaching kids to code”. It represents a huge and welcome shift of perspective, away from technology and towards principles and ideas.\n\nBut it’s also a massive challenge. What does a good computer science education look like in primary school classroom? How can teachers with little subject knowledge of computer science teach it? Aren’t computer scientists all socially-challenged male geeks anyway?\n\nIn this talk, Simon explains what’s going on, especially the recent launch of the National Centre of Computing Education. This revolution is taking place in our core expertise, in within yards of our front doors. And we are being invited to contribute to it, and shape how it “lands”. What an opportunity! Let’s grab it; Simon will make concrete suggestions about how.\n\nSlides & full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/simon-peyton-jones/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - SIMON PEYTON JONES\nPrincipal researcher at Microsoft Research\n\nSimon has been a researcher at Microsoft Research in Cambridge, England since Sept 1998. He's also an Honorary Professor of the Computing Science Department at Glasgow University, where he was a professor during 1990-1998.\n\nSimon is interested in the design, implementation, and application of lazy functional languages. In practical terms, that means he spends most of his time on the design and implementation of the language Haskell. In particular, much of his work is focused around the Glasgow Haskell Compiler, and its ramifications.\n\nSimon is chair of Computing at School, the group at the epicentre of the reform of the national curriculum for Computing in England. Computer science is now a foundational subject, alongside maths and natural science, that every child learns from primary school onwards (background here).\n\nMore on Simon Peyton Jones: https://codesync.global/speaker/simon-peyton-jones/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE MESH LDN 19\nCode Mesh LDN is powered by Code Sync.
