description: "Leveraging Istio & Envoy to Deliver New Capabilities in CF - Shannon Coen & Aaron Hurley, Pivotal\n\nThe core Routing and Networking teams have been working on integrations between CF, the Envoy proxy, and the Istio control plane. These initiatives have the goal of delivering on features requested by the CF community in the domain of application traffic management and security policy for workloads on CFAR and between CFAR and CFCR. We'll share our motivations, goals, provide an update/demo on what we've accomplished so far, provide a vision for the foreseeable future, and how the community can contribute/collaborate.\n\nhttps://cfseu18.sched.com/event/FRyQ/leveraging-istio-envoy-to-deliver-new-capabilities-in-cf-shannon-coen-aaron-hurley-pivotal"
