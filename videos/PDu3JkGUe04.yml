title: 'Overhead, not downtrodden – Penny Wyatt | The Lead Developer UK 2016'

description: "There are many super-important roles in software teams that are also financial overhead, e.g. QA, Support and Bugfix. They’re necessary, but they require people that would otherwise be working directly on business goals. For leaders of these overhead teams, it can be frustrating, having to justify keeping them well-staffed. We often point to the problems in the business that they address: “We need a big bugfix team, look how many bugs we have!”\n\nBut what if we flipped our thinking? Instead of denying that we’re overhead; we embrace it. Instead of using the size of the problem to justify the team size; we aim to reduce both. “Let’s halve our bugfix team by halving the bugs we ship in the first place”. In this talk, using personal examples from JIRA QA and Bugfix, Penny Wyatt will describe how this flip in leadership mindset can lead to happier engineers, teams, stakeholders and customers.\n\nABOUT PENNY WYATT\n\nPenny is a QA and Dev Manager at Atlassian (an Australian software company), working on an issue tracker named JIRA. Her role is to challenge everything that makes sense, and to come up with crazy ideas that improve Atlassian’s quality and devspeed.\n\nSuccessful experiments include: improving quality by reducing testing; getting better QA engineers by hiring non-testers; and improving devspeed by increasing the scope of dev work.\n\nIn previous roles, Penny’s been in dev, testing, dev-in-testing, IT support, and bellringing for weddings. Her favourite hobbies are eating and sleeping, with travelling a close third."
