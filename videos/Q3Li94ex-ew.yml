description: "Video recording from AmsterdamJS Meetup https://www.meetup.com/AmsterdamJS/events/244906789/\n\nKoen Bok is the co-founder of Amsterdam-based Framer (https://framer.com), a tool that aims to bridge the gap between design and development. They recently closed a pretty massive round of Series A funding (https://blog.framer.com/building-your-go-to-interactive-design-tool-900b276e19d6), which puts them in a unique position to invent the future of UI prototyping and visual code editing. We are curious to hear all about it in a cosy Fireside Chat with the visionary behind this local success story."
