description: "Speaker: Teng Kee Wee\n\nEver wonder what goes into building a laser cutter machine? Machine builder Kiwi would be doing a reverse teardown of a CO2 laser cutter right here at OMG!\n\nLaser cutting is a technology that uses a laser to cut materials, and is typically used for industrial manufacturing applications, but is also starting to be used by schools, small businesses, and hobbyists. Laser cutting works by directing the output of a high-power laser most commonly through optics. The laser optics and CNC (computer numerical control) are used to direct the material or the laser beam generated.\n\nCommon uses are cutting and engraving patterns onto material such as wood, leather and acrylic, and is considered one of the faster processes in rapid prototyping. Join us for this sharing session to demystify the laser cutter machine!\n\nBiography\n\nKiwi Teng is an innovative machine designer and builder, and has worked on a multitude of fabrication machines, including a CNCs, 3D Printers, vacuum formers and laser cutters.\nDismayed by the slow decline of manufacturing capabilities in Singapore, he set out create an example by building a machine in 6 months with limited resources and knowledge, able to do additive, subtractive, forming and cutting manufacturing, and showcased it at Makerfaire 2016. He hopes to inspire and encourage others in Singapore to adopt the same innovative Maker spirit that built early Singapore!\n\nEvent Page: https://www.facebook.com/events/1374774485871548/\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/SU5J/"
