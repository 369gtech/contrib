Too often I see developers use divs or spans to make buttons, but when you do this you're missing out on SO MANY FEATURES. You may not realize just how much accessibility and general purpose functionality is built into the simple button, but it's actually a wonderful tool that should be your first and last option whenever you're adding an action to your page.\n\nSo today I want to sing the praises of button and clue you in to a few handy features you might not have seen before.\n\nSynthetic Click Activation in the HTML spec\nhttps://goo.gl/Ey4RBf\n\nWatch all A11ycasts episodes: https://goo.gl/06qEUW\n\nSubscribe to the Chrome Developers YouTube channel for updates on new episodes of A11ycasts: http://goo.gl/LLLNvf"
