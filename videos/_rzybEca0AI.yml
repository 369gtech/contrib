description: "Want to hear a tale of last minute rejections, expeditions and pulling through by the tips of our folking beards? Do you want to see a couple of backend devs blunder around until they have something that's good enough for both the iOS and Android app stores? Or do you just want to see some goats, fiddles and bunting?\nGood news! Folk fan or not, come along for a wholesome dose of community spirit, overcoming the impediment of a life spent with Ruby on Rails and triumphing against adversity!\n\nChris is the Software Development Manager at a digital agency called Papercloud, where he spends his time writing mostly Ruby, managing a team of iOS, Android, Web and Backend developers, and helping take new startups from an idea to a business.\n\nFor more information on YOW!
