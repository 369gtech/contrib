description: "Optimizing sites to load instantly on mobile is far from trivial. Costly JavaScript can take seconds to process, we often aren't sensitive to users data-plans, and browsers don't know what UX-critical resources should load first.

Addy Osmani (and friends) illuminate new loading best practices for diagnosing and making real world sites load instantly today.\n\nEVENT: Chrome Dev Summit 2017\n\nSPEAKER: Addy Osmani\n\nPERMISSIONS: The original video was published on Google Chrome Developers YouTube channel with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nThumnbail: Shreyas Amargol\n\nORIGINAL SOURCE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_srJ7eHS3IM"
