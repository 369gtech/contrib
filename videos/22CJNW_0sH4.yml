language: English
recordingDate: 1506326798
description: "A corner stone of any solution is its build and release process. In this talk, I will demo why developers should use FAKE to build their DevOps process.\nThere are many build / CI servers out there, and there are even more options for scripting something. However, coming up with something that can be adopted by everybody in the team, easy to use, and dependable, can be challenging. FAKE makes this a lot easier, especially when you have different environments, varying build agents (Windows/Mac/Linux), and multiple challenging build steps. I will show how FAKE could be used to simplify any build process, and I will demo parts of my real world DevOps process."
