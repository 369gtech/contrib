description: "Realtime applications are easy with Node, but how do you scale out when the load hits? Zopim shares the lessons learnt at scale, as well as their approach to enterprise class software of a simplified network topology eschewing dedicated load balancers and firewalls.\n\nYang Bin is a co-founder of Zopim and currently works on simplifying the distribution of realtime data across their POPs and the frontend. One day, he hopes to open source Zopimâ€™s web application framework, but in the meantime he dabbles in image processing, visualizations and chinchillas.\n\nJSConf.Asia is the JavaScript, web and mobile developer conference for Asia. Amara Sanctuary, Singapore - 20 + 21 November 2014.\n\nSource: http://2014.jsconf.asia/#speakers\nProject link: http://github.com/zopim/ipcluster\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
