description: "Thanks to the plateau of per-chip performance increases and the resulting need to work better with multi-core CPUs, the relative difficulty of mapping user requirements to general-purpose programming languages, the emergence of language-agnostic \"virtual machines\" that abstract away the machine, the relative ceiling of functionality we're finding on the current crop of object-oriented languages, and the promise and power of productivity of dynamically-typed or more loosely-typed languages, we're about to experience a renaissance of innovation in programming languages. Come hear why this is, and what practicing programmers need to do in order to ride the forefront--instead of the trailing edge--of this new wave in computer science.\n\n\nEVENT:\nBuild Stuff 2019\n\n\nSPEAKER:\nTed Neward\n\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nConference Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish Build Stuff conference videos\n\n\nCREDITS:\nBuild Stuff YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCis5B3Zru-vymPRcbpM1NEA"
