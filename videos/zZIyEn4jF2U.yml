description: "Have you ever wanted to create a build script for your application, but been faced with learning a new language, or DSL, or writing more XML than any person should ever need to?\n\nHave you ever wanted to create a build script that will work cross platform?\n\nHave you ever wanted to create a build script that has first class support for the most common build tools like XUnit, WiX, SignTool, and many others?\n\nHave you ever wanted to create a build script that uses a language that you already know, and love?\nIf you have answered yes to any of these questions, then the Cake (http://cakebuild.net/) Build Automation System is for you!In this session we will start with a standard .Net Solution and incrementally add a build and orchestration script to compile the application, run unit tests, perform static analysis, package the application, and more, using the C# skills that you may already have."
