description: "This presentation was recorded at Voxxed Days Belgrade 2016 - https://belgrade.voxxeddays.com/\n\nIn large organisations, sometimes projects and parts of the code base get shuffled around between teams. Projects that have tons of responsibilities, that are business critical and that are hard to look after. What happens when a self-organised team that has a continuous delivery system in place receives one of these legacy product that is the antithesis of best practices? The talk approaches this issue with a real life example, highlighting the problems encountered and the solutions suggested and applied to each of them."
