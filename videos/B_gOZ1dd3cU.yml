description: "This is a talk from Velocity Conference 2012\n\nMichelin Starred Cooking with Chef at Etsy- Jon Cowie Part 1\n\nThis talk is designed for intermediate Chef users, who are comfortable with the building blocks of Chef such as roles, cookbooks, environments et al, and aims to equip them with ideas, best practices and thinking patterns to help them get more out of Chef, and build a dependable and resilient Chef infrastructure. We will talk about some techniques and approaches for making Chef less intimidating and easier to learn for both intermediate and advanced users. We'll look at getting under the hood and figuring out the nuts and bolts of Chef through both a critical approach and experimentation and also demonstrate some best practices we've identified at Etsy and how we've made Chef a comfortable, essential part of our Engineering team's workflow.\n\nAbout Jon Cowie\n\nJon is a Web Operations Engineer at Etsy, having done the rounds as Syadmin at several London tech startups. He likes Chef. A lot.\n\nNOTE: You can watch part 2 of the session here: \n\nChef Part 2:  http://youtu.be/25MhLG0e56M"
