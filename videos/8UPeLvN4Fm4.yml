You are going to see how this can be done in a DevOps fashion, with full automation from provisioning cloud resources to build and release of your application. Learn how you can create robust web applications and web APIs that are resilient and robust, and how to add monitoring and instrumentation so any bugs or failures can be spotted early and pro-actively. We will go through the entire inner loop of fixing the bug on a local development environment with Visual Studio and Docker tooling, and take the fixed solution to production to a production Azure Kubernetes cluster with automated pipelines in VSTS. Be a DevOps pro and impress all your friends with your rapid iteration for cloud scale solutions."
