title: 'DrupalCon Nashville 2018: Hot JAMS(tack): Building a Music Discovery App with Drupal and React'
recordingDate: 1523548950
description: "Learn from one developer’s experience building a music discovery app\_with Drupal 8 and React, soundtracked by the hottest jams of 2017 (Remember that year? Yikes!)\n\nOn an annual basis, The Album of the Year Project follows a painstaking Process to compile all of the best of the year lists into one massive google spreadsheet that crowns a definitive musical critical consensus (DAMN.) While an\_intriguing dataset is practically the American Dream, how could a curious developer take the Plunge and go from a Google Spreadsheet to a JavaScript application\_while gaining A Deeper Understanding of Decoupled Drupal and React along the way?\n\nYour awesome mixtape will include:\n\nA Common Sense approach to choosing a decoupled architecture - progressively decoupled vs. fully decoupled and why a fully decoupled approach was most appropriate for this project.\nCTRL your API with the right flavor of Drupal - Contenta vs. Reservoir, vs no distribution, and why Reservoir was chosen for this project.\nMigrate to the rescue - getting data from a Google spreadsheet and the Spotify API into Drupal without resorting to getting Drunk.\n4:44 worth of React basics (actual time may vary)\nQuickly bootstrapping a project with Create React App\nComponents, Props and State - oh my!\nGo Fetch! - getting data from JSON API into your app.\nCSS in JS (aka Nothing Feels Natural) - How I avoided a Crack-Up and learned to love styled components.\nTake Me Apart and deploy me back together - a look at the JAMstack and efficient ways to build and deploy your application.\nThe rest of The OOZ - the things I conveniently avoided, the things I’d do differently next time around, and why I threw away the first version of this app and started over.\n\n\nLast but not least, we'll wrap up with some\_Melodrama\_and ask the question\_'did this project really need Drupal'?\n\nBy the time the mixtape fades out, you’ll have a clearer picture of what it takes to go from compelling dataset to decoupled app, and may even be itching to join the Party and do something similar yourself. You’ll also know beyond a shadow of a doubt that critics really, really loved Kendrick Lamar’s latest album.\n\nThis talk is for people who are are\_interested in decoupled Drupal but unsure where to start, people who find it helpful to learn from real world decoupled projects, or even just people taking a Slowdive into decoupled Drupal concepts who want to avoid some poor developer's rookie mistakes. \_Experienced React developers are unlikely to learn something new about React here, but will better understand how Drupal could be a viable option to serve their front end work.\_\n\nLive app:\_http://brianperryinteractive.com/aoty-visualizations/\nRepository:\_https://github.com/backlineint/aoty-visualizations\nFull slides available here:\_http://brianperryinteractive.com/aoty-slides/\_(or\_PDF version\_- doesn't contain all dynamic content)"
