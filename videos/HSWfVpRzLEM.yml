description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2013\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nEva Andreasson - Cloudera\n\nABSTRACT\nOK, so recently or in a near future your boss (or inner voice) will tell you \"We need to figure out how we can utilize Big Data\". Maybe you've heard about Hadoop, but you haven't really had the time yet to wrap your head around how to actually get more value out of new types and huge sets of data. What can Hadoop do for you? This is a talk giving examples of how Hadoop can be used for real world use cases. Attend this talk to get inspired and educated on how to use Hadoop and get your first Big Data insights using this popular scalable data processing and storage framework. We will walk through an example around analyzing social media data, and also look at other kinds of problems you can solve by presenting a couple of real world examples.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
