title: 'XAI meets Natural Language Models - Larissa Haas [PyData Südwest / Big Data BBQ]'
language: English
recordingDate: 1634661997
description: "Explainable AI gets more and more attention, as customers and users want to understand how AI models get to their predictions and conclusions. But it is difficult to apply “traditional” XAI approaches to Natural Language Processing/Understanding models, because data points loose their meaning through different preprocessing techniques and data types. Therefore, I will talk briefly about possible workarounds, solutions and lessons learned.\n\n\nPyData Südwest: https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/PyData-Suedwest/\nEvent website: https://www.koenigsweg.com/big-data-bbq2021-community/index_eng.html\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
