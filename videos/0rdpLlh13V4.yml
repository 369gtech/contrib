language: English
recordingDate: 1631046469
description: "Cryptocurrency wallets are used to store the public and private keys of your account, keep track of the balance, conduct transactions in sending and receiving the currencies, as well as other functions with the blockchain. Wallets are divided into two types: software (a.k.a. hot) wallets and hardware (a.k.a. cold) wallets. Software wallets are accounts on cryptocurrency exchanges or accounts based on online websites. Hardware wallets are accounts stored on an offline means.\n\n  In this talk, we deal with a comparative analysis of all categories of these wallets. For this, first, we present a systematic method to evaluate the risk of cryptocurrency wallets, and then we review two hardware wallets ('Ledger Nano S' and 'Trezor One', both of which are the world's best-selling wallet) and four software wallets ('Bread', 'Trust Wallet' for mobile, and 'Copay', 'Electrum' for PC)."
