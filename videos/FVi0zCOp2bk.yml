recordingDate: 1433514856
description: "This session focuses on embedding JVM scripting languages in Java applications. Groovy, JRuby, JavaScript...there are plenty of options to choose from. How do you go about choosing one when you have to deal with scripting in your next Java project. The different JVM scripting languages have different features, and the presentation analyzes the cases for and against, depending on the area of the application. It also assesses the different options for embedding the scripting engines into the runtime even though the options are fairly limited: you can use either JSR 223 interfaces or direct integrationâ€”each has its own strengths and pitfalls. You will learn how to integrate scripting into a Java application and what the benefits of this approach are.\n\n\nAuthor:\nAnton Arhipov\nJRebel (@jrebel) product junkie @ ZeroTurnaround, vim fan and IntelliJ addict http://linkd.in/aarhipov\nView more trainings by Anton Arhipov at https://www.parleys.com/author/anton-arhipov\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
