description: "This talk is an introduction to GraphQL with demos and resources for getting started with the framework.\n\nBuilding a web Application Programming Interface (API) traditionally involves a significant amount of work: defining routes, writing functions to fetch and shape data, ensuring a consistent interface, documenting the API, and more.\n\nGraphQL, an open source alternative framework for fetching data over HTTP, seeks to reduce much of the overhead of building more traditional web APIs. All data from a web service is provided at a single endpoint, and consumers can discover data schemas to then build and run queries to get only the data they need. The result is faster and more efficient development experience in many aspects of building and consuming the data layer.\n\nTalk by Daniel Lemay at the PDX Node meetup at OSCON 2018.\n\nThanks to PDX Node for giving us permission to share this talk.
