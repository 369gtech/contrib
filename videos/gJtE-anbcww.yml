description: "\"Advanced pytest\n[EuroPython 2019 - Talk - 2019-07-11 - PyCharm]\n[Basel, CH]\n\nBy Raphael Pierzina\n\nThere are many reasons why I think pytest is a fantastic test framework: assertion introspection, setup and teardown with fixtures, parametrized tests. But plugins are the real game changer!\n\nWe'll dive right into customizing a test suite by developing a series of pytest plugins based on a few neat hacks. We'll learn how to automatically add markers to slow running tests, run only tests that use a fixture which can be specified on the CLI, generate test reports in a custom format, and automatically create GitHub issues for test regressions. We'll wrap up this talk by using Cookiecutter to create Python packages from our plugins that are ready to be published on PyPI.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2019.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/"
