description: "Recorded at SpringOne Platform 2016.\nSpeakers: Sebastien Deleuze, Stephane Maldini\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/a-lite-rx-api-for-the-jvm\n\nRxJava is a fully fledged and widely used solution to develop Reactive applications, but some interesting alternatives exist. After an overview of the main Reactive APIs available and of Spring Boot Reactive support, this workshop introduces how to develop Reactive applications using Reactor Core 2.5-a powerful and fast alternative. We will learn how to use Flux (N values) and Mono (single value) types with various exercises. This new API (which is the core of Reactor 2.5) is a game changer in the world of Reactive API on the JVM thanks to its Reactive eXtensions-based API (natively based on Reactive Streams and Java 8) and its unmatched performance."
