description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Chicago 2019. #GOTOcon #GOTOchgo\nhttp://gotochgo.com\n\nStephen Magill - World-recognized Expert on Program Analysis\n\nABSTRACT\nHistorically, static analysis has been widely used to identify defined sets of security issues via overnight runs across entire code bases. A recent trend has been the evolution of static analysis methods and tools to:\n1. become much more scalable and\n2. leverage machine learning to substantially improve code quality.\nThese improvements allow a much tighter integration into modern agile development processes. At the same time, the scope of these tools has broadened from purely security-relevant bugs to performance and reliability issues like memory leaks and data races. Google and Facebook have pioneered a new model of static analysis deployment that involves improving developer productivity via broad deployment of extremely scalable static analysis (billions of lines of code / thousands of commits per day).\nThis talk will review these recent developments as well as the history of static analysis in commercial software and its evolution in the academic world. It will provide an overview of the current commercial landscape, and conclude with best practices [...]\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotochgo.com/2019/sessions/783/disrupting-qa-–-emerging-trends-in-code-quality-automation\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOchgo\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\n#Testing #QA #CodeQuality\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO Conference near you!
