title: 'Records Deep Dive: What, Why and How - David Wengier - NDC Melbourne 2021'
language: English
recordingDate: 1628241658
description: "Records were a new feature introduced in C# 9 that allow concise definition of immutable data classes that you may have already seen or even used. In order to support them there were also related new concepts introduced like \"primary constructors\", \"init accessors\" and \"with expressions\", and there are also some traps with records that you should be aware of, like for example I probably shouldn't have referred to them as \"immutable data classes\".\n\nIn this session we will dive Records in all of their C# 9 glory, and cover what is coming in C# 10 that is related. We'll cover what they are, how they work under the hood, and most importantly how you can take advantage of the features they bring along to the language even if you can't, or don't want to, move to using them directly."
