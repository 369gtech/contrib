description: "This presentation will be on the legal nature of bitcoin. The following aspects will be examined: bitcoin’s fundamental features, what is considered “money” from an economic and legal perspective and the difference, if any, between bitcoin and money. A specific reference shall be made to ECB’s position, to the EU Court of Justice judgment in case C-264/2014 and to EU Parliament’s resolution of April 19th, 2018.\nMoreover, I will explain the effects of bitcoin’s definition as a “mean of payment on a voluntary basis” and the differences between bitcoin and fiat money with a legal tender."
