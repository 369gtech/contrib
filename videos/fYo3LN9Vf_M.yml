description: ". When coding applications you cannot always stay on the \"happy path\". In a robust production-ready application you must deal with validation, logging, network errors, and other annoyances. How do you handle all this using a functional programming approach?\n\nThis talk will provide a brief introduction to error handling in functional programming, using a fun and easy-to-understand railway analogy."
