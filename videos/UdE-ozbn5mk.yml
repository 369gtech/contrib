description: "Multi-platform development is difficult!\nAt Unified Remote we're a two-person team that maintains and develops native apps across 6 different platforms. Why did we decide to build native apps and how do we maintain them? What challenges have we faced along the way? What would we have done differently today?\nJoin me as I share my story and share some insights into how we develop our apps.\n\n\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry in the Malmö/Lund region. Foo Café is aimed at those interested in sharing, learning and creating. \nJoin the fun at foocafe.org"
