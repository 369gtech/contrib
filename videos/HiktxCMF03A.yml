description: "Matt Turner, Native Wave\n\nThese are the days of VMs, containers, and service meshes. The network, for a long time the sysadmin's mysterious domain, is now at the forefront: providing overlays, security features, and headaches. It's vital to be able to understand what's going on under the hood of a cloud-native platform if you ever hope to debug it, but do you know a TAP from a TUN, let alone an ipvlanL3? This talk will take you through all the network interface types on modern Linux, from good old eth0 to the vEths used by Docker and the tunnels used by Calico.\n\nView the full SREcon19 Asia/Pacific program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon19asia/program.\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
