title: 'Integrating CERN Software Distribution with Docker'

recordingDate: 1509731612
description: 'CVMFS is the CERNVM Filesystem, a scalable, reliable and low maintenance software distribution service. It offers a POSIX interface to a set of cache instances distributed worldwide, as part of the infrastructure used to process and analyse the data from the multiple experiments at CERN - including the ones from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In this session, we describe how physicists have started moving their workloads into containers, and how we integrated CVMFS into Docker using a Volume plugin. We''ll show how repositories are mounted and how we use tags and hashes to mount the repositories at a well-known state, essential for data analysis preservation. Finally, we''ll cover how we''re looking into optimizing data access via Docker storage drivers'
