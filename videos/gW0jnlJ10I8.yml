description: "Are you having Sprint Planning meetings that are long, hot, boring, it smells bad in the room, and in the end everyone agrees to a Sprint just to get out of there? If the answer is yes, then Visualised Flow will likely help you a lot.\n\nDo your stakeholders know what you’re working on at this moment?\nDo they know what you are going to work on next?\nDo they know if the things you have just finished are actually in production or not?\nDo they know what actions they need to take to get their items to the front of the queue?\n\nIf the answer is no, then Visualised Flow will likely help you a lot.\nThere is nothing more crucial to the success of a product than successful collaboration, at least that’s what we believe in the Agile world. Collaboration is hard in any context, but it’s basically impossible when people are talking about different things. This is what Visualised Flow is for. Not only can visualising this process increase transparency throughout your organisation, but it is built to facilitate and support collaboration across your organisations. The goal is to visualise how value flows through your organisation, from the moment something is requested to the moment it arrives to the intended recipient. Anyone in your organisation should be able to know status of an item at a glance.\n\nIn this workshop we will learn what you need to know to visualised your organisations value flow, look at what levels of abstraction you need to provide the right amount of information to the right people, explore how to improve this process once you’ve visualised it, and finally make sure you have what you need to ensure success when you return to your organisation"
