description: 'In Java 8 functional style programming was introduced in Java. Java 9, 10 and 11 extended this with some nice new features.

The opportunities Java gives us out of the box are massive on the other hand with great power comes great responsibility.

This way you can make better, cleaner and more readable code. But even more important, you will be able to utilize the functional code constructions in Java to it’s full potential ….. and maybe, you even start to like it.'
