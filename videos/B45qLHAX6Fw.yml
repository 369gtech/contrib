recordingDate: 1484900863
description: "Casey West\nhttp://linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/180/\nWhat does it really mean to keep systems secure on the cloud? When software workloads are distributed across elastic clusters, scaling automatically, and changing rapidly the notions of what it means to be secure shift. In this talk I’ll show concrete patterns for continuously delivering security based on Justin Smith’s excellent [\"Rotate, Repave, and Repair\"](https://medium.com/built-to-adapt/the-three-r-s-of-enterprise-security-rotate-repave-and-repair-f64f6d6ba29d) pattern.\r\n\r\nI’ll dive into using common open source tools and up-to-date organizational and cultural practices while exploring the philosophy of this modern approach to security.\r\n\r\nYou’ll leave this talk understanding the importance of automation, secrets management, immutable infrastructure, and continuous delivery all from a security perspective. More importantly, you’ll gain a deeper understanding of practical use cases for tools designed specifically to address these concerns.\r\n\r\nYour CISO has never been this happy."
