title: 'GopherCon UK 2021: Nick Craig-Wood - Deadlocks: The Dark Side of Concurrency'
recordingDate: 1637907865
description: "Go makes it so easy to write concurrent programs that sooner or later you will run into a deadlock. A deadlock is where your program (or part of it) just stops working for mysterious reasons.\n\nThis talk will explain what deadlocks are and why the Go deadlock detector isn't very useful in real world programs.\n\nDeadlocks can be very difficult to find and fix and this talk will give lots of tips on how to figure out why your program deadlocked and how to fix it and avoid deadlocks in the future.\n\nYou will need an understanding of go routines, locking (sync.Mutex) and channels to get the most out of this talk. No previous deadlock experience required!"
