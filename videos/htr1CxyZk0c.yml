description: "Ever wanted to know what it takes to stop a multi-data center roll out (MPLS-backed, pick-any-hardware, Cloud Foundry + Data Lakes) mid way, and begin an “all in” move to public cloud? \n\nThe vision of composable enterprise at Warner Music Group lives on, with Cloud Foundry being the backbone of application factory churning out cloud-native applications using a swarm of microservices, paving the way for all-digital revenue sources. \nIn this session, you will join us in the journey we are taking all the way from managed private cloud running Cloud Foundry and data services, to rethinking the economics of composable enterprise, to running on multiple availability zones at AWS. \n\nAt the end of the journey, attendees will find themselves holding a 5-point lists of patterns and antipatterns, a practical 10-point tip sheet, and a sample “one pager” reference deployment architecture of highly available Cloud Foundry and surrounding data lakes on AWS. \n\nAdam Chesterton\nAdam Chesterton is a Director of Engineering at Warner Music Group, where he is responsible for all things Cloud Foundry. Prior to WMG, Adam was Development Manager with Reuters. Prior to Reuters, Adam was Enterprise Analyst with GE Consumer Products.\n\nRenat Khasanshyn\nRenat Khasanshyn is CEO of Altoros and Venture Partner at Runa Capital.
