I swore a lot, but I also learned a lot. I learned new tools, new interfaces, and the rabbit hole took me past most major parts of Istio.    Today I'll recreate that debugging session live, to show you the mental models and techniques I used to methodically follow this issue through a complex distributed system. We'll learn about systems debugging techniques in general, and operating Istio in particular. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UaeJ"
