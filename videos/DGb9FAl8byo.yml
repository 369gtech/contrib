language: English
recordingDate: 1433784751
description: "CLDC has been the Java platform for connected devices such as feature phones for many years. It is a platform for devices with very limited memory and CPU power. Oracle is leading an effort to update the CLDC platform with support for Java 8 language features and new library APIs. The platform defines a state-of-the-art runtime environment for small embedded devices and provides a set of carefully defined libraries that are most useful on resource-constrained devices. CLDC 8 targets embedded devices such as wireless modules, smart meters, and healthcare monitoring and other M2M devices. The CLDC 8 platform is standardized in the Java community process as JSR 360, with experts from the embedded and mobile industry in the expert group.\n\n\nAuthors:\nMichael Lagally\nundefined\nView more trainings by Michael Lagally at https://www.parleys.com/author/michael-lagally\n\nRoger Riggs\nRoger Riggs is a Consulting Member of Technical Staff at Oracle working on the architecture and specification of APIs for the Java Platform.
