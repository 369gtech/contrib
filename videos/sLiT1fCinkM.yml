description: "Let's Build a Blog with Cloud Foundry! - Julz Friedman, IBM\n\nThis talk is a live coded, worked, real example of how easy it is to use Cloud Foundry to build an application. There are no slides, just a terminal, Cloud Foundry and some jokes in an English accent. \n\nWe'll go hands-on from starting your app, pushing it to the platform, testing it locally, scaling it, binding services, viewing logs, debugging issues, using route services and then using container networking to break down the app in to micro-services as it becomes more complex.\n\nAbout Julz Friedman\nJulian Friedman (julz) is an IBMer and the project lead for Cloud Foundy's low-level container engine (\"Garden\") and Eirini (the project to allow Kubernetes to be used as the container scheduler in CF). He has previously worked on various Cloud Foundry projects, performance optimization of Jeopardy-playing AIs, large scale and small scale Cloud projects, emerging technologies consulting and various other things. He has a doctorate in Large Scale Complex IT Systems (with a focus on data-parallel systems and Map/Reduce) which he is pretty sure is a long way of saying “Clouds”. If you have several free hours and enjoy the sound of a rant delivered in a British accent, ask whether he thinks pushing a database to a cloud platform is a good idea.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2Mk9-54Bs0&list=PLhuMOCWn4P9h-9tcBVRFCaQ7rmdof66pe&index=6"
