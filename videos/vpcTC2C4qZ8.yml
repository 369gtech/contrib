description: "It’s often considered hard to use persistent storage correctly with Kubernetes. The concepts of Volume, PV, PVC, Storage Class; the implication of read-write-once vs read-write-many; the difference between Deployment vs StatefulSet are each obstacle for users to fully understand Kubernetes’s persistent storage.\n\nIn this session, Sheng Yang will briefly talk through all these concepts first, clarify the implications and differences. Then Sheng will use most of the time to demonstrate real-life usage for Kubernetes persistent storage, to help with understanding the Kubernetes storage concepts.\n\nIn this webinar we will discuss and demo:\n* Volume, PV, PVC, Storage Class, CSI, etc. and what these concepts really mean.\n* The implications of RWO vs RWX storage system, and the differences between Deployment and StatefulSet. And how to choose which one to use.\n* Use Rancher and Longhorn to demonstrate the real-life use cases for Kubernetes persistent storage.ext"
