description: "Reusing Google APIs with Google Web Toolkit\r\nMiguel Mendez (Google)\r\n\r\nWe like to say that GWT brings software engineering to the crazy world of Ajax, and of course straightforward code reuse is a cornerstone of smart software engineering. Naturally, then, we had to create easy-to-reuse jars that provide Java-friendly versions of the popular Google JavaScript APIs. It's called the Google API Library for GWT.\r\n\r\nHeard of Google Maps? Gears? It's in there. Gadgets, too. Come to this hands-on session to see just how easy it can be to employ Google APIs in your GWT projects."
