description: "Speaker: Martin Andrews\n\nSynopsis:\n\nMartin's current day-job involved processing text - and this talk shows how Deep Learning techniques (word embeddings and recurrent neural networks) can be applied to text.  It will include a walk-through of a working Jupyter notebook (which people can follow along with using a VirtualBox Appliance that will be circulated at the event).  \n\n\nBio: \n\nMartin Andrews has a PhD in Machine Learning, and has been an Open Source developer since 1999.  After a career in finance (based in London and New York), he decided to follow his original passion, and now works on Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence full-time.  Martin has given several talks and workshops on Deep Learning over the last 12 months, including FOSSIA, PyConSG, DataScienceSG and at the Fifth Elephant conference (in India). \n\nSlides: http://redcatlabs.com/2017-01-23_PyDataSG_RNNs-for-NLP/\n\nSample Code: https://github.com/mdda/deep-learning-workshop\n\nVirtual Box Appliance: http://redcatlabs.com/img/deep-learning-workshop_2017-01-23_00-12.ova\n\n(The Jupyter notebooks will appear at http://localhost:8080/Â­ and the password is 'password')\n\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/PyData-SG/events/235981761/\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/3Zmq/"
