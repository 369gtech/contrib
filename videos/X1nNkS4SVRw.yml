description: "When it comes to getting users to your website, nothing is more important than the elusive techniques of Search Engine Optimization. Without a prominent search enginer ranking, your website will be doomed to a clickless, loveless oblivion. Unfortunately, Search Engine Optimization is wildly misunderstood and thus poorly employed method for improving your traffic. Angelina Fabbro has (unfortunately) been a part of the world of SEO since the dawn of the internet, and even before search engines (don't ask how - she'll tell you how!) ever existed.\n\nIn this talk, Angelina will teach about key strategies to synergize your content with your affiliate link program requirements, such as:\n\n- optimal keyword density per page\n- tweaking your meta tags for better indexing\n- writing effective alt-tags for your images\n- white hat vs. black hat SEO\n- doorway pages\n- article spinning\n- in-bound link strategy\n- why you should pay Angelina to do all of this for you\n- and more!\n\nBe mystified no further - no matter what color hat you like to wear (please don't let it be a fedora) Angelina will have practical solutions for you to grow your website empire."
