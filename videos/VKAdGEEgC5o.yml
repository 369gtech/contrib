description: "http://strataconf.com/strataeu2013/public/schedule/detail/31197\n\nThere is a huge amount of data available from the NHS and other sources about public health in the UK. This is a fascinating resource for the working or aspiring data scientist, as it's large enough to do real modelling on, and has enough real world impact to suggest multiple interesting questions and models to apply to it.\n\nThis session will - walk through several interesting large datasets which are already available, including prescribing data and hospital statistics - show some example visualisations and models based on this data, coming from different perspectives (including business, public health, and public policy perspectives). This will include more detailed explanation of the statistical models applied and visualisation tools used"
