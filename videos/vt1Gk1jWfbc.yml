Traditional host-based network security must be replaced with modern service-based security to accommodate the highly dynamic nature of modern runtime environments.  In this talk, we will look at Connect a significant new feature in the open source Consul from HashiCorp. Connect provides secure service-to-service communication with automatic TLS encryption and identity-based authorization.   We will cover both the theory why a Service Mesh enhances your application security, and a deep dive on configuring and operating Connect and Envoy to secure your Kubernetes services.\n\nTo learn more click here: https://sched.co/FuKY"
