description: "Curiosity is something that all humans exhibit in some way throughout their lives. Recently, a team at Berkeley published a paper on Curiosity driven learning, and they demonstrated how it helped enable their AI agent to learn how to play the popular game Super Mario Brother very efficiently with the added benefit of curiosity to help Mario explore his options. I'll explain how it works in this video using code, animations, math, and the spoken word. This technology can be used to help make our systems more intelligent, and thus our applications more capable of helping other people.
