And so we propose a path forward, describing how API Machinery can better serve these and future users, and how the Kubernetes runtime, libraries, tools, and repositories can be refactored in service of this goal. API Machinery is a force multiplier for Kubernetes, but often disguised as a tax; it’s time to rectify this together. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/GrTu"
