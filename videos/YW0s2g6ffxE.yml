language: French
recordingDate: 1634026441
description: "Original title : \nBuild a photo sharing application with Google Cloud serverless technologies\n\nSpeaker : Guillaume LAFORGE (Google)\n\nIn this university, you will discover the various serverless options offered by Google Cloud Platform, such as Cloud Functions (functions as a service), App Engine (application as a service), and Cloud Run (container as a service). You will create an application that lets users upload, analyse, and share pictures. Data will be stored in Cloud Storage (images), Cloud Firestore (structured data). Along the way, additional services will be used such as the Vision API (a machine learning API to analyse pictures), Cloud Logging (to track interesting events), Cloud Scheduler (to invoke workloads on a schedule), Cloud Pub/Sub and Eventarc (to receive events) and Workflows (to orchestrate services)."
