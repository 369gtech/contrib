description: "Sorry for the quality, we had some technical issues with the connection\n\n\nInaka (part of Erlang Solutions) has an ever growing team of Erlangers who usually work in small teams for different projects. To really be able to do so smoothly, some degree of uniformity on the generated code is required. Over the course of the years and the projects, we've compiled an (also ever growing) list of Erlang Guidelines and Best Practices that we enforce. They are now public at github for all to see and contribute.\n\nBut, stating the rules and giving new devs access to them is just the first step. In the spirit of Ruby's Hound, we created Elvis. Elvis is an Erlang style-checker written in Erlang that you can run in your console or integrate nicely in your github projects.\n\nErlang Solutions invites you to join our next webinar featuring Brujo Benavides (Inaka's CTO). He'll present an overview of Elvis, he will let you how it works and how it was built. He will also open the discussion about Erlang Guidelines and code styles.\n\nIn this webinar, you'll learn:\n- What Elvis is and how it can improve your development cycles\n- How to write Erlang code that checks your Erlang code\n- How to integrate with github APIs\n- Some Erlang coding styles and standards\n\n \n\nhttps://github.com/inaka/talks/blob/elbrujohalcon.elvis.webinar/sources/brujo/elvis.webinar.2014/Introduction.md"
