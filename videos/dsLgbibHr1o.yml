description: 'The next billion people going online live in emerging countries, where the mobile phone is the main point of communication, the use of mobile apps and web is different and the infrastructure places limits on internet usage. Getting a better understanding will improve the inclusiveness of your work towards people worldwide. In this talk the speaker will share her experience, from both researching and putting the learnings to practice in Nairobi. Some of the subjects we''ll cover include: the local tech ecosystem, common apps and devices, localisation guidelines and technical limitations.'
