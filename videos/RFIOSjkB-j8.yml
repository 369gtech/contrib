description: "Code Mesh London is the best place in Europe for non-mainstream tech and programming languages. On 4-5 December 2013 over 50 inventors and originators of the most innovative languages and technologies of the moment shared their experience with 200 attendees. Topics included Scala, Haskell, Clojure, Erlang, Elixir, Julia and much more. See you at Code Mesh 2014! codemesh.io/\n\nAbout the talk:\nGo is a statically compiled systems programming language aimed at C/C++ developers which draws its inspiration from the low-ceremony of popular dynamic languages. It is very easy to learn and particularly well-suited to implementing concurrency.\n\nTalk Objectives:\n\nIn this session we'll learn the basic syntax and semantics of the language by examining the flexible for{} construct, starting with the most basic C-like forms and building through type assertion, closures, channels and reflection to demonstrate the basics of generalised iteration. Testing and benchmarking will also be covered, imparting sufficient knowledge to begin using the language for practical development.\n\nTarget Audience:\n\nThis talk is suitable for moderately experienced developers and does not require any familiarity with Go."
