description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nCreate an Extensible Cloud Native Application with WebAssembly - Connor Hicks, Suborbital Software Systems\n\nWebAssembly can be used as a tool to transform your application into an extensible platform. Allowing developers to write code in a variety of languages, and then running that code as part of your application is a very enticing prospect - but it needs to be done in a way that ensures performance and security. In this talk, we'll explore how Wasm can be used to create extensible systems that your users can customize and extend to fit their needs. We'll look at how your services can interact with a Wasm execution environment and run your users' code in a high-performance and secure manner using open source tooling and frameworks. When done correctly, these capabilities can be a huge win for any SaaS product. This talk will ensure that the benefits, drawbacks, challenges, and best practices of Wasm-based extensibility are well known and easy to understand. Developers and low-coders want to make full use of your software, so this talk will cover all the points you need to consider when making your product extensible. Cloud native software is changing, and we want to help the next generation of SaaS applications provide everything that modern developers are asking for."
