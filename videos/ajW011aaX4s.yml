title: 'Breaking the build with K6 load tests - Lars Jakobsen - NDC Oslo 2020'
recordingDate: 1601452243
description: 'Performant services are increasingly important, and every change to your service can affect that performance. So, what if you could make load tests part of your release pipeline? In this talk, we''ll look at K6, an open-source command-line load testing tool, and show how you can check if your APIs can handle a massive burst of users in a short period of time. We''ll also look at how you can add load tests to your Azure DevOps Pipeline and make the build fail if the APIs don''t perform.'
