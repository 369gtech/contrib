description: "NSDI '21 - Scaling Distributed Machine Learning with In-Network Aggregation\n\nAmedeo Sapio, Marco Canini, and Chen-Yu Ho, KAUST; Jacob Nelson, Microsoft; Panos Kalnis, KAUST; Changhoon Kim, Barefoot Networks; Arvind Krishnamurthy, University of Washington; Masoud Moshref, Barefoot Networks; Dan Ports, Microsoft; Peter Richtarik, KAUST\n\nTraining machine learning models in parallel is an increasingly important workload. We accelerate distributed parallel training by designing a communication primitive that uses a programmable switch dataplane to execute a key step of the training process. Our approach, SwitchML, reduces the volume of exchanged data by aggregating the model updates from multiple workers in the network. We co-design the switch processing with the end-host protocols and ML frameworks to provide an efficient solution that speeds up training by up to 5.5 times for a number of real-world benchmark models.\n\nView the full NSDI '21 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi21/technical-sessions"
