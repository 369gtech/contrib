How do we balance our reliance on tools against learning and implementing best practices to create great websites?\n\nPhoto of Joshua Marantz\nJoshua Marantz\nGoogle\nJoshua Marantz is a software engineer at Google, where he is tech-lead of mod_pagespeed, a project to build an open-source Apache module for automatically improving website latency and reducing bandwidth consumption by rewriting HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Images.
