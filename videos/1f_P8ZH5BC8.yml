Defining infrastructure as code should make systems consistent, reliable, and easy to manage, but an infrastructure codebase can easily become a complicated, fragile mess that is scary to change.\nIn order to routinely change, extend, and improve infrastructure, teams need to have confidence that changes will work correctly and that the impact of failures is low and easily corrected. This creates a virtuous cycle of continuously improving the quality of the systems. Teams can gain this confidence by applying appropriate design patterns and implementation practices.\nKief Morris shares patterns and examples of Terraform projects using pipelines, automated tests, and loosely integrated stacks to enable a continuous flow of changes and improvements. These patterns—which have been used at clients across the financial services, retail, public sector, and media industries—ensure that any part of the infrastructure can be easily rebuilt, minimize the “blast radius” for a given change, automatically validate changes for correctness, security, compliance, and other operational and architectural requirements, and structure projects to enable multiple people [...]\n\nRead the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotoams.nl/2019/sessions/759/building-evolutionary-infrastructure\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOamst\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\n#DevOps #CloudNative #Serverless #DeveloperProductivity\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO Conference near you!
