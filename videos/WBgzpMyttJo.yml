description: "Slides: https://www.slideshare.net/jcleveley/mobilism-2013-a-story-of-how-we-built-responsive-bbc-news\n\nLife used to be easy. We created sites to work on a few browsers and when we had time we asked the new guy to build a half baked mobile version. Then the device explosion ruined our cozy happy dev life.\n\nMy talk will discuss how BBC News met this challenge at scale.\n\n- How we support as many devices as possible using responsive design\n- Why performance is key to our success and how we managed to keep the site lean\n- How we scale to serve BBC News to the masses\n- What tools we use to help us along the way\n\nAbout John: https://twitter.com/jcleveley\nAbout Mobilism: https://mobilism.nl\n\nVideography generously sponsored by Mirabeau: https://www.mirabeau.nl"
