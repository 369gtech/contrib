description: "It is certainly a time of discovery- though the truths revealed by the COVID-19 crisis can be bitter and bleak. At a time when all attention is focused on the ERs and ICUs that make up the battle’s front lines, it is easy to cast aside old warnings to focus solely on the clinical war. But the need for safety and security only increases in the face of a pandemic- and healthcare cybersecurity is no different. From testing to ventilators, every facet of our response to COVID-19 depends on trustworthy and reliable technology.\n\nD0 No H4rm- DEF CON’s continuing conversation on healthcare returns for another up close (but not too close) and personal dialogue between hackers at the top of their fields- from the halls of the FDA to the cutting edge of medical devices security research for an all-encompassing look at what we need to focus on in the age of COVID. Moderated by physician hackers quaddi and r3plicant, this perennially packed event aims to recruit the talent, ingenuity, and vision of the DEF CON family for the challenges we face both now and after the immediate crisis passes."
