description: "From time-to-time our front-end workflows can become pretty repetitive. Sometimes we attempt to manually compile pre-processed languages, minify and concatenate our code. In this presentation Bermon Painter reviews common front-end workflows and how they can be automated with GulpJS. Front-end developers of any level are encouraged to watch and learn.\n\nBermon Painter\nUser Experience Designer, bermonpainter.com\nhttps://twitter.com/bermonpainter\nhttp://bermonpainter.com\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
