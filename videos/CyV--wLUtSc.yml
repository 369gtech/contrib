description: "When you want to understand and master Cloud Computing there are several patterns that you need to be aware of. These patterns come in different forms and levels. There are patterns implemented by the cloud platform provider that dictates things like data\ncenter design and pricing and there are patterns that you need to understand to best solve your problems.\n\nThis will not be a complete coverage of every possible pattern suitable for cloud computing but it will be an overview of things that will help you get a better understanding of the platform that you are using or plan to use!\n\nWe will go thru some of these patterns in general and show examples on how they are implemented in Windows Azure. No prior knowledge of Windows Azure is needed!"
