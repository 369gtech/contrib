description: "Wouldn’t it be awesome if you could write a React component once and render it in web, native, and even VR applications without changing a single line of code? Thanks to several libraries that bring React Native’s primitives and APIs to the web, now you can! This talk will introduce three libraries that allow you to develop cross-platform components: React Native Web, React Primitives, and ReactXP. You’ll also learn how to architect your shared component base to achieve maximum reuse across platforms.\n\nEVENT:\n\nReactNext 2017\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nPeggy Rayzis\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nReactNext Conference Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to publish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nReact Next: https://react-next.com/"
