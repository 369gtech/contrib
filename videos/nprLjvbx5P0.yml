description: "While remote work is the dream, reality for many of us is office work. Which means commuting. Have you paid much attention to your commute and how it affects your work day? I never did, just kept scrolling on my phone, until I decided to test three popular methods of commuting.\n\nJoin me on a journey to discover what skills you can take from commuting, including planning and organising your day, improving your mindfulness and wellbeing, or using the time to learn and develop new skills. Iâ€™ll share with you how you can find more time in the day through commuting and how you can create your own journey to happiness and growth.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks, courses, and conferences in the following links:\nhttps://ndcsydney.com/\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
