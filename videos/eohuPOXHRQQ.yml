description: "JavaFX 8 offers a rich set of visually appealing UI controls, a convenient property binding mechanism for event handling, and a powerful tool for layout and design. This session shows you how to develop mobile applications with Java and JavaFX and deploy them on IOS and Android devices, all from the same code base. The session begins with an overview of JavaFX UI controls and property binding techniques. After demonstrating an example JavaFX application with FXML, Scene Builder, and Gluon Maps, you’ll learn how to deploy the app on a mobile device (IOS or Android). You’ll also learn how to keep connected mobile devices updated when data in the cloud changes. This session includes several useful examples and shows how Java and JavaFX makes it easy to develop applications that target different mobile devices. This write once, run anywhere (WORA) platform uses an IDE plug in and library support from Gluon to create native applications.\n\nPaul L.
