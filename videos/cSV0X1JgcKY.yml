description: "Speaker: Lorenzo Miniero, Meetecho\r\n\r\nWhile WebRTC was conceived as peer-to-peer, it’s actually quite common to have one of the peers in the communication be a server side application, especially when complex scenarios are envisaged, which may or may not involve legacy technologies not compliant with the WebRTC specification itself.\r\n\r\nOne of the most popular solutions for such a server side WebRTC solution is Janus, an open source WebRTC server implemented by Meetecho. Janus was conceived as modular, with pluggable modules to handle different transports for its API, and more importantly for the media management, thus basically acting as a “general purpose” WebRTC solution. As such, it is currently used by several people and companies to empower their WebRTC applications, in scenarios that range from traditional applications like web conferencing, contact centers and e-learning, to more innovative contexts like videogame streaming and IoT.\r\n\r\nThe presentation will introduce the Janus architecture, its features, and how it can be used, deployed, monitored and troubleshooted, plus a quick view on the most recently added functionality. An overview on some of the existing Janus deployments will be provided as well, including details on how Janus currently serves the IETF remote participation services.\r\n\r\nAbout the Speaker:\r\n\r\nLorenzo Miniero is the chairman and co-founder of Meetecho, a company providing consulting services on everything related to real-time multimedia, while also regularly providing streaming and remote participation services for well known events around the world (e.g., IETF and ACM).\r\n\r\nLorenzo received his degree and Ph.D. at the Computer Science Department of the University of Napoli Federico II, where he started working on multimedia conferencing and met the colleagues with whom he co-founded Meetecho as an academic spin-off.\r\n\r\nHe is an active contributor to the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) standardization activities, especially in the framework of real-time multimedia applications.\r\n\r\nHe is most known as the author of the Janus WebRTC Server, an open source WebRTC server-side implementation.\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/Singapore-JS/events/244884529/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/cbo2/"
