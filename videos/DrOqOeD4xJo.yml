description: "At Codemotion we praise diversity,  the richness and inspiration it nourishes.\n\nJust like snowflakes, no two are the same, but all of them are special, so we all are different, and we all are unique, since we all belong to the same, one race: the human race.\n\nJoin us! \nAnywhere you may find a Codemotion Tech Conference, you will be welcomed."
