title: 'Codemotion DeepLearning Conf 2020: Developing Enterprise Chatbots: Understanding Q''s Finding Answers'
language: English
recordingDate: 1592419549
description: "The typical customer care virtual assistant (aka chatbot) can answer simple questions and maybe even perform some actions. But when a question falls outside of the scope of the pre-determined question set, usually the assistant tells the customer that the question isn’t valid or offers to speak to a real person. There’s another option: instead of relying on predefined responses, it’s also possible to retrieve the answer in additional sources of information. For example, if the question is about a specific operation of a device, we could automatically extract the answer the customer needs returning relevant passages of the device manual. We will show you how to create a virtual assistant that really helps solving the customers’ problems instead of disappointing him with a “Sorry, I don't know”.\n\nSpeaker: Alessandro Rea, Cloud & Cognitive Solution Architect, IBM"
