Current unit testing solutions for C++ usually require arcane constructions through macros, intrusive changes in the tested codebase in the form of class hierarchies for easy mocking, and in some cases manual test registration.\n\nI present unittest, a proof of concept unit testing framework for C++14 based on Python's standard unittest package. unittest avoids the problems described above by using static reflection to figure out what code describes a unit test, and what library functions should be mocked as part of the test. Current C++14 implementation is based on tinyrefl, a libclang based static reflection tool, but the same concept will be possible to implement through future C++ reflection features like those proposed by the Reflection Technical Specification.\n— \nManu Sánchez\nBy Access Control Systems\nSoftware Engineer\nMadrid, Spain\n\nManuel Sanchez started playing with modern C++ during his first year at the university, evolving into a template metaprogramming nerd and so-called C++ \"expert\". In September 2014 Manuel joined the Spanish startup biicode as a C++ consultant, helping the main developers packaging complex C++ libraries such as Boost. Since September 2015 Manuel is a software developer at By, a Spanish firm specialized in access control systems. Since January 2016 is a member of the Spanish ISO C++ national body.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
