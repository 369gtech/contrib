They'll explore interesting Big Data use cases with some of our public datasets, using BigQuery's SQL-like language to return query results in seconds. They will also cover some of BigQuery's unique query functions as well. For a general overview of BigQuery, watch our overview video: http://youtu.be/QI8623HlYd4.
