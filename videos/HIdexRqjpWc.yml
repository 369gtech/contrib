description: "Why do we have such a hard time getting engineering teams to care about vulnerabilities? How is it that we are fixing lots of vulnerabilities, yet are still falling ever further behind on the actual risks? These questions both have the same answer, but getting to it requires empathy, trust, courage, and a giant step back from our day-to-day approach to security.\n\nIn this talk we will share our experiences about creating proactive partnerships with engineering and product teams. From the ways we have seen this fail to recent success stories, we will illustrate specific practices that help developers and security teams focus and align on a shared view of risk, rather than a laundry list of vulnerabilities: the leverage that comes from enabling rather than gating, automating for visibility and action to manage scale, threat modeling across organizations rather than individual applications, and the particulars of how we get big security features onto busy product teams' roadmaps.\n\n\nScott Behrens\nSenior Application Security Engineer, Netflix\nInformation security engineer with a focus on helping organizations enable their business's success.
