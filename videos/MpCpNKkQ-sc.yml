Not only that - if we gain confidence in the way we build our software, we can sleep better at night knowing that it won’t explode in the middle of the night.\nIn this talk we're going to cover something I call \"The Testing Spectrum\" - a set of tools, practices and mindset of shipping high quality code to production. From prettier all the way to monitoring, let's avoid your next production incident together!\n\nThis event would not take place without the support of sponsors:\n\nPlatinum Sponsors\nSauce Labs → https://saucelabs.com/\n\nGold Sponsors\nStackHawk → https://www.stackhawk.com/\nNeuralegion → https://www.neuralegion.com/\n\nSilver Sponsor\nTestim → https://www.testim.io/\n\nProduction Partner\nFocus Reactive → https://focusreactive.com/"
