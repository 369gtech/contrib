description: "Kubernetes is a powerful container orchestration platform embodying many design choices. Unfortunately, deploying a Kubernetes cluster requires developers to deal with a dizzying array of network configurations!!!\n\nIn this session, we will highlight how Pivotal Container Service (PKS) highly simplifies and drastically reduces networking provisioning needs for your Kubernetes service deployments. With the powerful integration of NSX-T Virtual Networking solutions, PKS fully orchestrates Node Networking, POD Networking, Load Balancer and Security Policy provisioning. This coupling allows operators the ability to focus on service and application optimizations, instead of worrying about infrastructural-layer provisioning. \nNetworking provisioning aspects for Day-1 and Day-2 PKS operations will be discussed, with a high-level overview of the architectural details, such as multi-master deployments, AZs, and service exposures. We'll also highlight how cluster upgrade procedures minimize service disruptions and support ease-of-use.\n\nSpeakers:\nGaetano Borgione\nSenior Staff Engineer @ Cloud Native Applications, VMware\nAngela Chin\nSenior Software Engineer, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
