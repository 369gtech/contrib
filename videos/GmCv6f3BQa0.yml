recordingDate: 1612427583
description: "Marc MERLIN\n\nhttps://lca2021.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/109/\n\nLearn about the rabbithole of LEDs, how it went from a single tri-color LED on my first OHMC project, to a \"it was only there because LEDs are bling\" neopixel ring on garduino, to a \"few\" LEDs on my party shirt, and then shirt and pants, to \"it's gotten out of hands\",  a 1538 pixels on panels driven by ESP8266, then 12288 pixels driven by ESP32, and now 49152 pxels driven by a raspberry pi. \r\nAmazingly the last 3 projects, despite using very different hardware, use the same codebase and graphics library I wrote, Framebuffer::GFX.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
