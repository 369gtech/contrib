description: "Презентация и тезисы:\nhttps://phprussia.ru/2019/abstracts/5008\n\nThe main goal of Machine Learning is to create intelligent systems that can improve and acquire new knowledge through input. In practice this translates into the use of one of hundreds of different algorithms available. Based on the PHP-ML library I want to present different classes of problems and how to use them. I will also show you how to build an entire pipeline by which we go through all the ML stages: preprocessing, choosing algorithms, and evaluating its effectiveness.\n\n-------- \nНашли ошибку в видео?
