Maybe you need to time the playing of your file? Maybe you need to navigate around your audio file and extract meta data?\n\nWith the Audio Element and a little bit of JavaScript you can find out what's really going on under the hood and craft your application accordingly.\n\nThat's what I'll be demonstrating for you in quick this tutorial. We'll take a look under the hood at how this element and its associated events work.\n\nIt's pretty basic, and its targeting beginners, so you advanced kids might want to go and watch something else. You might prefer spending your time investigating the HTML5 Audio API (which is little more advanced, covering buffers, typed arrays and all that fun stuff).\n\n\n*****\nHTML5 Bootcamp Training: http://crcl.to/j0oyz"
