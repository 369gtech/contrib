description: 'On September 20, 2011, President Obama announced to the Open Government Partnership not only the launch of a new online tool for petitioning the U.S. Government, but also his intent that the technology itself be shared "so that any government in the world can enable its citizens to do the same." Less than a year later, that promise was fulfilled when the source code for this tool: We The People, was published to GitHub. Since then, The White House''s engineering teams have further expanded their open source commitment with contributions to Drupal.org, more repos and pull requests on GitHub, hosting hack-a-thons, as well as the launch of their Petitions APIs, to expose the data from We The People, and let others create and sign petitions from their own apps and platform. Leigh will talk briefly about these achievements and more importantly what the future holds for Open Source and Open Data at The White House and the many ways citizens and developers can get involved.'
