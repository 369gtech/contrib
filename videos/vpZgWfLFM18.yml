title: 'To x64 or Not to x64, That is the  dll Question and Why Does it Not Run'
recordingDate: 1380647642
description: "Normal set-up of QtTest include and lib for the Engine project cover in Game Engine Development video# 23.\n\nNo changes need to be done with GED video # 24.\n\nFinally the last half of this video we'll learn how to use VS \"Configuration Manager\" to set up our project \"Platform\" target. This is important because it has to do with our engine .dll and lib file. The running one version of a program file with a different version of the .dll/lib file will not work and may cause hernia. \n\nThis video supplement the Game Engine Development video number 23 - 25. \n\nNOTE: At the end of this video the QtEngineTest project will compile but it will not run properly. Do still follow the video because you'll still need the Qt and Engine .dll file for the next 3 videos."
