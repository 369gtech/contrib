title: 'A Skeptics Guide To Functional STYLE JavaScript'
language: English
recordingDate: 1509210943
description: "With modern JavaScript, we have seen a rise in ‘functional style’ javascript popularity. This style introduces a whole slew of terms and patterns that have different connotations depending on who you are talking to. Phrases like purity, higher order functions, and currying are thrown around all over the place. What does ‘no side effects’ mean, and what about when you need to get something done? And what in the world is a ‘monad’? In this talk, Jon will walk through the world of the functional programmer and show how these phrases and patterns fit into modern JavaScript development. Jon will work through functions as first class objects in JS, and show how we can use that feature to write clean, maintainable, and reusable code. You will also walk away armed with the information you need to see through all they hype. You’ll have a firm grasp of where these patterns are useful, and as importantly, where they are not.\n\nEVENT: NEJS CONF 2017\n\nSPEAKER: Jonathan Mills\n\nPERMISSIONS: The original video was published on the NebraskaJS YouTube channel with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nORIGINAL SOURCE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twwSstZlMRE\n\nAdditional material for JavaScript learners:\nhttps://amzn.to/2JrUINQ      Eloquent JavaScript, 3rd Edition: A Modern Introduction to Programming \nhttps://amzn.to/2HwAMYd  Simplifying JavaScript: Writing Modern JavaScript with ES5, ES6, and Beyond\nhttps://amzn.to/2Cq5bmL   JavaScript: JavaScript Programming.A Step-by-Step Guide for Absolute Beginners\nhttps://amzn.to/2uhIvAP      How JavaScript Works\nhttps://amzn.to/2CwS2bU   The Modern JavaScript Collection"
