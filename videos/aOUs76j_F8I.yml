description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\n基于 Tekton 构建大规模云原生 CI/CD 系统 | Build a Large Scale Cloud Native CI/CD System Based on Tekton - Jinming Yue & Deyuan Deng, ByteDance\n\n随着基于 Kubernetes 的生态系统的广泛采用，社区和企业对微服务架构有着越来越大的兴趣。伴随着这一趋势，需要云原生的 CI/CD 系统来支持微服务应用的快速迭代开发周期。Tekton 是基于 Kubernetes 的开源云原生 CI/CD 项目；但是，其主要设计用于单集群环境，不能解决跨不同区域在多个集群上同时运行多个线路的挑战。在本次讨论中，我们将介绍一种构建于 Tekton 之上的大规模云原生 CI/CD 系统，用于解决上述问题。该系统为字节跳动数以千计的应用程序交付提供动力。我们将分享设计该系统时的实际经验和需要注意的陷阱，以及我们如何解决多区域部署带来的性能和安全问题。\n\nThe community and enterprises have seen increasing interests in microservice architecture with the wide adoption of Kubernetes based ecosystem. Along with the trend, a cloud native CI/CD system is required to support the rapid iterative development cycle of microservice applications. Tekton is an open source cloud native CI/CD project based on Kubernetes; however, it is mostly designed for a single cluster environment, and can not address the challenges of running multiple pipelines simultaneously on several clusters across different regions. In this talk, we will introduce a large scale cloud native CI/CD system built on top of Tekton that solves the aforementioned challenges. The system powers thousands of application deliveries at ByteDance. We'll share the practical experience and pitfalls when designing the system, and how we address the performance and security issues that come along with multi-region deployment."
