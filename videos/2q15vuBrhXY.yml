description: "Speaker: Eric Meyer (@meyerweb)\r\n\r\nOur designs are filled with elements, and every element has its own background area, where a potentially infinite number of layers can be created. Eric will explore a number of ways to use that design space in ways both eye-catching and subtle.\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://singaporecss.github.io/56\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG"
