description: "Google Tech Talks\nOctober 25, 2006\n\nAvideh Zakhor, Prof. UC Berkeley\n\nABSTRACT\nIn this talk, we present a fast approach to automated generation of textured 3D city models with both high details at ground level, and complete coverage for birds-eye view. The goal is photorealistic rendering for walk throughs, drive through and fly throughs. A close-range facade model is acquired at the ground level by driving a vehicle equipped with laser scanners and a digital camera under normal traffic conditions on public roads in a continuous, rather than a stop-and-go fashion, resulting in extremeley fast data acquisition times; a far-range Digital Surface Model (DSM), containing complementary roof and terrain..."
