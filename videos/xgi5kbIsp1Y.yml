language: English
recordingDate: 1475944691
description: "The Cloud Platform Engineering team at GE Digital are big fans of Cloud Foundry, it's the foundation of their Industrial Cloud Platform called Predix. Their global Cloud Foundry install base serves a developer community of thousands, and run tens of thousands of production application instances. \n\nOne of the key benefits of Cloud Foundry is it's ability to dynamically scale all of it's core components using BOSH. As Cloud Foundry subsystems like runners and routers are scaled out to keep up with demand, ensuring that the new nodes automatically come under monitoring and metrics collection coverage, and keeping health dashboards up to date becomes challenging! \n\nJeff Barrows will show how the Cloud Platform Monitoring team is using Sensu, an open-source monitoring framework, and Graphite, an open-source realtime metrics collection solution, to provide health and availability data on all Cloud Foundry components and Marketplace Services. He will also show how they build and maintain summary KPI, health, and utilization dashboards in Grafana - an open source graphing and dashboard visualization tool, and cover some simple strategies they use to help keep everything up to date in a dynamic environment. \n\nJeff Barrows\nGE Digital\nManager / Technical Lead - Cloud Platform\nOakland, CA\nJeff Barrows has been working at GE Digital for the past two years as a technical lead, and manager of the Cloud Platform Engineering team, for GE's Industrial Cloud Platform called Predix.
