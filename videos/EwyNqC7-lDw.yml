description: "VoltAir demonstrates how LiquidFun can be used within a consumer application. LiquidFun is an open source technology that provides developers with a liquid particle system and a physics simulation. \n\nIt is available here http://google.github.io/liquidfun/.\n\nVoltAir itself is open source software available at http://google.github.io/VoltAir.\n\nThe application features a spunky, speedy robot stranded on an alien planet. Going as fast as his single wheel will carry him, he flies over ramps, zips around meteors and rides geysers in his search for the portal that will take him home.\n\nLiquidFun fluids are used in a few different ways throughout the game. Fluids are used as obstacles for our little robot hero to work around, as platforms that lift our hero to new heights and as a way to add moving, splashing graphic touches to levels.\n\nNote: VoltAir works best on mobile devices running Android 4.4, KitKat."
