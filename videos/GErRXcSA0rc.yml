description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io\_The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nBuild a Multi-Tenant Training Platform Based on Kubeflow at Tencent - Lei Xue, Tencent \n\nMachine learning workflows within Tencent have been migrated to Kubernetes by adopting Kubeflow and Kubeflow Pipelines. It helps teams increase model development speed and have better GPU utility.  The self-serve multi-tenant platform on K8s is built for ML developers based on Kubeflow. Users can train their models using accelerated hardware in an isolated environment with the help of Virtual-Kubelet. Distributed machine learning jobs can be configured and triggered from the API and/or extended kubectl command line. Also, we will introduce how we improve the GPU utility by smart batch scheduling, GPU sharing, NVidia-docker start optimization, node replacement in training and so on.  Highlights:  * Multi-tenancy on Kubernetes with Kubeflow * Native Kubeflow federation cluster with Virtual-Kubelet * How to improve GPU utilization and performance \n\nhttps://sched.co/cp8u"
