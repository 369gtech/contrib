Check out the code for this talk on my GitHub profile to see if you'll find it interesting: github.com/halidebey/PyCon2018\n\nWe'll be working with a dataset of tweets and aiming to accurately categorize each tweet as relevant or irrelevant for the police using Machine Learning.\n\nAs I'm going through a live demo of the data cleaning process & analysis, I will (quickly) cover some machine learning concepts. To make the talk a bit more interactive, I recommend that attendees come with their (charged) laptops and go through the code during the talk.\n\nThe speaker suggested this session is suitable for new programmers.\nThe speaker suggested this session is suitable for teachers.\nThe speaker suggested this session is suitable for data scientists."
