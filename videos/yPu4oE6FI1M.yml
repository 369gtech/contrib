title: 'Building User Adaptive Interfaces with Preference Media Queries'
language: English
recordingDate: 1624661451
description: "In this Workshop, we are transforming and adapting a plain hypertext markup language (HTML) form with cascading style sheet (CSS) only, making it themeable, responsive, and animated. We use device-based media queries, user-based media queries, logical properties, and relative units to customize the interface to the context and preferences the user needs. As we customize, we use DevTools to inspect, emulate and verify that our design can adapt to as many users as possible.\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).
