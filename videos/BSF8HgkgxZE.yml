The energy and innovation of this community is transforming our company. Our first forays into the world of containers were inward-looking and produced some false starts. As we have engaged more with the community around Kubernetes, you have flipped our perspective from infrastructure up to developer down.  Now we’re moving with the ecosystem and making our biggest technology bet in a decade—embedding Kubernetes in our flagship product, vSphere. Kubernetes has the power to be a uniting force for IT operators and developers, and this community is the catalyst. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UdPt"
