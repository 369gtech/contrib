description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nIntro to Rook: Storage for Kubernetes - Jared Watts, Upbound & Alexander Trost, Cloudical \n\nIn this talk, the Rook project will be introduced to attendees of all levels and experience. Rook is an open source cloud-native storage orchestrator for Kubernetes, providing the platform, framework, and support for a diverse set of storage solutions to natively integrate with cloud-native environments. Rook turns storage software into self-managing, self-scaling, and self-healing storage services. It does this by automating deployment, bootstrapping, configuration, provisioning, scaling, upgrading, migration, disaster recovery, monitoring, and resource management. The benefits and use cases of Rook will be explored along with an overview of each of the Rook storage providers: Ceph, EdgeFS, YugabyteDB, Cassandra, NFS, and CockroachDB. Rook was accepted as the first storage project hosted by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation in January 2018.\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zex7"
