description: "From the 2014 Strata Conference + Hadoop World in New York City.\n\nThe world is a rapidly changing place, where time flies and technological innovations batter us fast and furiously. Hadoop is just nine years old; and just five years ago had nowhere near the audience, ecosystem, or impact it has now. No one was really talking of in-memory databases five years ago and now it is mainstream with SAP, IBM, Microsoft, and Oracle, all presenting offerings. What will the Big Data landscape look like in 2020, just 5 short years from now? Is Big Data to fade away? What will the market be? What role will Hadoop have in it? What about data science and predictive analytics? What impact will the skills shortage have? No industry will be untouched and changes in one industry will inevitably have a cascading effect on others. By 2020, just 5 short years hence, no industry will be anywhere near what it currently is. Come hear one perspective of the Big Data world five years from now.\n\nThis keynote is sponsored by SAP.\n\nAbout John Schitka:\nJohn Schitka, is a Solution Marketing Manager on the SAP Big Data Solution Marketing team. His focus in the SAP Big Data arena is largely on Hadoop and SAP HANA smart data access capabilities. A graduate of McMaster University, he holds an MBA from the University of Windsor.
