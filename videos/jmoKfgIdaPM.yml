description: "I am going to use a masonry style layout to display cards of differing heights. At least some of the cards will have images, and eventually there will be a need for infinite scroll. \n\nI have also included an interview I recorded at SyntaxCon with Rick Rein from Operation Code.\n\nSee a professional front-end developer at work. Unscripted.
