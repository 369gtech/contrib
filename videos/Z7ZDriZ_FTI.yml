title: 'YOW! Nights / Agile Sydney August 2016 Jeff Patton - How Doing the Little Things Well...'
recordingDate: 1472796660
description: "What we do in software development is hard. Lots of companies, teams, and people pick up Agile approaches to make it easier, and then realize it’s still really hard. They learn that Agile didn’t fix things. And, then they get to work trying to fix Agile. What they, and I, often forget is that it’s doing the little things well that makes the big things easier. This talk is about the little things. The stuff hidden between the lines of the Agile books. The stuff the experts know that’s hard to explain. You’ll leave this talk with lots of small things to do that'll make a big difference.\n\nJeff Patton is highly regarded in the Agile community for his work around experience and product design. Jeff helps organisations improve the way they work to build products they’re proud of. Where many development processes focus on delivery speed and efficiency, Jeff balances those concerns with the need for building products that deliver exceptional value and marketplace success. To do this he teaches a blend of thinking and process styles including solid product management, agile development, design thinking, lean startup, lean user experience, and raw pragmatism.\n\nFor more on YOW!
