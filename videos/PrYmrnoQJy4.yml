recordingDate: 1389659046
description: "In order to be successful, technology must amplify a meaningful aspect of our human experience, and Twitter's success largely has been dependent on its ability to do this quite well. Although you could describe Twitter as just a \"free, high-speed, global text-messaging service,\" that would be to miss the much larger point that Twitter scratches some of the most fundamental itches of our humanity:\n\n  -   We want to be heard\n  -   We want to satisfy our curiosity\n  -   We want it easy\n   -  We want it now\n\nThis webcast explains why Twitter is \"all the rage\" by examining Twitter in light of these questions and exposing its underlying concpeptual architecture as an *interest graph.* Even if you have minimal programming skills, you'll come away empowered with the ability to think about data mining on Twitter in more effective ways and apply a powerful collection of easily adaptable recipes to fully exploit the 5 kilobytes of metadata that decorates those 140 characters that you commonly think of as a tweet. Learn how to access Twitter's API, search for tweets, discover trending topics, process tweets in real-time from the firehose, and much more in this densely-packed webcast.\n\nAbout Matthew Russell\n\nMatthew Russell (@ptwobrussell) is Chief Technology Officer at Digital Reasoning, Principal at Zaffra, and author of several books on technology including Mining the Social Web (O'Reilly, 2013), now in its second edition.
