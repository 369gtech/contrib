Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n \nCruise’s Self-Driving Networking Journey - Bernard Van De Walle & Jon Yucel, Cruise \n\nThrough its exponential growth, the Platform team at Cruise experienced a networking self-driving journey. We scaled our network across numerous clusters, multiple tenants, and multiple thousands of new pods instances a day.  We will take you on a tour of our architecture and you will get a better understanding of how we choose to configure our network and security in order to support Kubernetes loads across multiple regions and multiple environments. We will specifically showcase how we do this on a public cloud (GCP) even though similar results could be achieved on-prem.  You will come out of this session with concrete examples on what it takes to build your network and security needs for internal tenants at scale while keeping internal stakeholders happy (Platform, security and networking). \n\nhttps://sched.co/UaXO"
