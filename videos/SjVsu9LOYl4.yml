description: "Speaker: Menaka Chandrasekhar, Senior Product Designer @ PropertyGuru Group\n\nAs humans, we are emotionally wired to react to stories. They are the way we make sense of the world around us. It is also the most common tool we use to gather information and share it with others for thousands of years.\n\nFor designers, the opportunities are plentiful to become the narrators everyday – from the ideas we dream up in our portfolios, the product interactions that add delight, the presentations that help win minds over to the nuggets of insightful data uncovered from user interviews.\n\nIn this session, we will cover the science and techniques of storytelling that you can add to your design toolkit.\n\nAbout the speaker\n\nMenaka Chandrasekhar has over 10 years of design experience spanning across Singapore and India. With a strong background in graphic design, she has a unique skill set of designing for various experiences, both online and offline. Her love for problem-solving and pixel perfect designs eventually led her to become a digital product designer.\n\nThough she specializes in creating human-centered products, she also understands the value of balancing business needs and user goals. When she’s not busy being a super-mom after work, you may find her enthusiastically chatting away about geeky things (like the influence of AI and machine learning on UX) at design meet-ups across the city.\n\nhttps://sg.linkedin.com/in/designgeekme\n\nEvent Page: https://uxsea.org/summit-2019\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG"
