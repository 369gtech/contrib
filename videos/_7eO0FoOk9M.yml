description: 'As we emerge from a pandemic and a year where we all became at risk of developing COVID, many of us have become patients and caregivers navigating a healthcare system under siege. With the rise in ransomware attacks on hospitals, disinformation campaigns from state actors on social media, and new biosecurity threats there has never been a greater need to develop capacity for a new kind of immune response to emerging threats in digital health. Representation matters. During this talk, BRCA mutant turned Security Researcher share how patient communities - namely "the ePatient movement" - holds potential to bring a new type of representation to the field of cybersecurity. ePatients with disabilities have superpowers to co-design and co-production of new technologies with fresh eyes - and to help us protect the emerging technologies that have the power to cure or kill.'
