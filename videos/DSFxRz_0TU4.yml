description: "Visualise Cluster Connectivity with Goldpinger; Smash it with PowerfulSeal - Mikolaj Pawlikowski, Bloomberg \n\nLet's talk about two open source tools to test and troubleshoot your Kubernetes setup: Goldpinger and PowerfulSeal.    Goldpinger is a Kubernetes networking troubleshooting tool. Deploy it on your clusters and get a pretty graph of connectivity between all your nodes, Prometheus metrics to generate alerts from, and more. We will be introducing the tool and sharing it with the community during the conference!    PowerfulSeal brings Chaos Engineering to your Kubernetes clusters. It will destroy things following your policies, so that you can discover and fix problems before real outages happen. We published PowerfulSeal at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2017 in Austin, and we'll be giving you an update on the project's momentum. Learn more about it at https://github.com/bloomberg/powerfulseal.    Come to our talk and gain two new Kubernetes superpowers! \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/GrX6"
