description: 'Is it better to write '''' + 42 or Integer.toString(42)? How much memory can you save if you intern() all of your strings? How can String Deduplication reduce your memory footprint and what does it cost? And how much memory will Java 9 Strings save in Polish? What is the maximum length of a constant String? And a dynamic String? How much faster is new StringBuilder().append(''Hello '').append(name).toString() than ''Hello '' + name? What are intrinsics and how do they relate to Strings? Are Strings really immutable? How can you efficiently create substrings? These and many more questions we will answer during this talk. Level: Intermediate Might want to add Dmitry Vyazelenko as co-speaker. We presented this talk together at Oracle Code One.'
