description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nPanel: Introduction to the Container Orchestrated Device (COD) Working Group - Renaud Gaubert, NVIDIA; Mike Brown, IBM; Mrunal Patel & Urvashi Mohnani, Red Hat; & Alexander Kanevskiy, Intel \n\nThe Container Orchestrated Device (COD) Working Group, is a small group formed by passionate Container Runtime Maintainers and Device Vendors looking to solve many of the challenges Devices face in the cloud native space. Custom Devices are used in many industries (HPC, 5G, AI and Deep Learning, Data center, …), from single nodes accessing devices over the fabric to thousands of devices communicating over the network, the working group is helping enable new and exciting progress in the data center! Attendees will hear an overview of the issues the current ecosystem faces with device support, new and exciting changes happening in the different runtimes (e.g: the Container Device Interface) as well as in orchestrators (e.g: monitoring of Devices) and the roadmap ahead to enable the cloud native space to support exciting new workloads (e.g: 5G applications, Multi-node Deep Learning, …). \n\nhttps://sched.co/ekDv"
