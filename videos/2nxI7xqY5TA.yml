recordingDate: 1433262010
description: "Most companies create a marketplace around their product catalog. Target’s approach was to create a marketplace from its Cart and Checkout services. The APIs it created enable third parties to use Target as their commerce checkout engine. In addition, these services provide companies such as the startup CosmicCart a platform for building new business. CosmicCart has built its business upon Target’s and other retailer services to create a new capability for bloggers and others to enable e-commerce on their sites. CosmicCart was built fully with Java on Spring. Learn more in this session.\n\n\nAuthors:\nAlex Adelman\nAlex Adelman is currently the CEO and Co-Founder of Cosmic Cart.
