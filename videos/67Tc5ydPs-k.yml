description: "Speaker:  Iain Nash (Github: @iainnash)\r\n\r\nDescription:  Many new wireless-embedded small ARM development boards have been coming out recently at really affordable prices. Many of these boards can run a stripped down javascript execution environment. This opens up development beyond less flexible, lower-level static and compiled languages increasing speed and accessibility for more developers.\r\nThis talk will cover Mongoose OS and Espruino on an ESP32 development board and on a ESP8266 Development Board. We will go from setting up the development environment on a fresh board, where to download and build the Mongoose OS framework, flashing the board, and ultimately creating a simple temperature sensor and doorbell device running a web server over WIFI.\r\n\r\nEvent Page:  https://www.meetup.com/Singapore-JS/events/245149764/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/eH4Z/"
