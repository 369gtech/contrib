description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nMental Health In Unprecedented Times - Dr. Jennifer Akullian, Growth Coaching Institute\n\nWe work in a demanding industry with unusually high expectations; one that has normalized long hours and burnout. Innovation has a high frequency of failure, that we have been conditioned to personalize. Add normal life stressors, add a global pandemic… How these challenges impact our mental, cognitive and physical functioning, our ability to perform at work and in life, our behavior and well-being, (*everything* that makes us human), needs to be discussed openly now more than ever. In a society where this topic has been neglected for ages, it's time to bring it to the forefront of discussion. Let's get it started."
