description: "Transscript: https://github.com/felixge/faster-than-c\nSlides: https://speakerdeck.com/felixge/faster-than-c-parsing-binary-data-in-javascript\n\nIn 2010 I wrote the first MySQL driver for node.js. I did it in pure JavaScript. It was fast. It was fun.\n\nA few month later, node addons using libmysql showed up in npm. They were much faster. It sucked.\n\nIn 2012 I had enough and went back to to the drawing board resulting in a much faster parser.\n\nThis talk will introduce you to the art of high performance binary stream parsing in node.js.\n\nFor reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
