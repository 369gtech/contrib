title: '"Computing Like the Brain" by Jeff Hawkins (2012)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1615180253
description: "The neocortex works on principles that are fundamentally different than traditional computers. In this talk I will describe recent advances in understanding these principles and their impact on future computer architectures. The talk will start with a description of sparse distributed representations, which are the fundamental units of information in brains. I will then discuss how these representations are learned and how the brain processes them to build predictive models from high velocity sensory data streams. Numenta has built a streaming analytics engine based on these principles. I will give a brief introduction to this product and speculate on the future of machine intelligence.\n\nJeff Hawkins\nNumenta\n@Numenta"
