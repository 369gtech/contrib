For Rubyists thinking about dipping a toe (or diving) into the thread pool, we can help you identify those early-stage “gotchas” that keep Rubyists from making an easy transition into the Elixir ecosystem.\n\nSlides & full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/randall-thomas/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - RANDALL THOMAS\nRandall Thomas (@daksis) is a classically trained musician that took one too many calculus classes and got sucked into geekery: computers, robots, video games, high energy physics - the usual suspects.\n\nAfflicted with rabid technology ADD, Randall has built companies in various industries with numerous startups -- everything from robotics to digital video to cloud computing. After escaping a high-security military prison and driving a heavily armed conversion van filled with ex spec-ops soldiers for hire around the Los Angeles underground. \n\nMore on Randall Thomas: https://codesync.global/speaker/randall-thomas/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM SF 2020\nCode BEAM SF is powered by Code Sync.
