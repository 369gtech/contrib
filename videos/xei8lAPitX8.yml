description: "After having compromised on-premise for many years, there is now also the cloud! Now your configuration mistakes can be accessed by anyone on the internet, without that fancy next-gen firewall saving you. With this talk Iâ€™ll share my current research on Azure privileges, vulnerabilities and what attackers can do once they gain access to your cloud, or how they can abuse your on-premise cloud components. We start with becoming Domain Admin by compromising Azure AD Sync, sync vulnerabilities that allow for Azure admin account takeover and insecure Single Sign On configurations. Up next is cloud roles and privileges, backdooring Azure AD with service accounts, escalating privileges as limited admin and getting past MFA without touching someone's phone. Then we finish with cloud integrations, also known as \"how a developer can destroy your whole infrastructure with a single commit\": Exploring Azure DevOps, backdooring build pipelines, dumping credentials and compromising Azure Resource Manager through connected services. Besides all the fun we'll also look into how this translates into the questions you should ask yourself before moving things to the cloud and how this differs from on-premise.\n\nDirk-jan Mollema\nDirk-jan is one of the core researchers of Active Directory and Azure AD at Fox-IT. Amongst the open source tools published to advance the state of AD research are aclpwn, krbrelayx, mitm6, ldapdomaindump and a Python port of BloodHound. He blogs at dirkjanm.io, where he publishes about new Active Directory attack chains, which included the discovery of the PrivExchange vulnerability. He is also co-author of ntlmrelayx and contributor to several other open source tools and libraries. After discovering that breaking stuff is a lot of fun he never looked back at his freelance web developer days, but is still thankful for the knowledge and experience that those days provided him.\n\nTwitter: @_dirkjan\nWebsite: dirkjanm.io"
