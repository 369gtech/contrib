title: 'Pragmatic Performance: When to care about perf, and what to do about it. - David Wengier'
recordingDate: 1542982009
description: "As a developer you often hear both that performance is important, but also that you shouldn't worry about performance up front, so when is the right time to think about it? And if the time is right, what are you actually supposed to do?\nIf you're interested to hear about a pragmatic approach to performance, this talk will explain when is the right time to think about benchmarking, but more importantly will run through how to correctly benchmark .NET code so any decisions made will be based on information about your code that is trustworthy.\n\nAdditionally you'll also find out about some of the common, and some of the unknown, performance pitfalls of the .NET Framework and we'll discuss the true meaning behind the phrase \"premature optimization is the root of all evil\".\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcsydney.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
