title: 'DEF CON 29 Biohacking Village - Nia Johnson -  Reflections on Race, Health, and Equity'
language: English
recordingDate: 1632543299
description: 'For many, 2020 was a year of reckoning-a reckoning of systems, a reckoning a racial inequity, and the reckoning of the self. Most of us are catching our breath after the highs and lows of a global pandemic, but we are approaching the time to reflect on what actually happened in 2020. This talk aims to help us reflect on this past year, the pandemic itself, and what we can gather about our healthcare systems. It will also center on the role that health disparities, mistrust in medicine, and general weathering played in exacerbating the pandemic.'
