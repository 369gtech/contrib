Krane is an open-source command-line tool created to solve this problem: it helps developers, especially those who may be new to Kubernetes, deploy with confidence.  Krane translates Kubernetesâ€™ asynchronous convergence process into a clear pass/fail result for each deploy. It detects unsuccessful rollouts and shows developers the information they need to take corrective action. Krane also helps ensure dependencies are rolled out in a sane order, it natively supports custom resources, it allows developers to run scripts as part of their deploys, and more! Come find out what Krane can do, learn how its design makes it resilient and scalable, and discover how it may help your organization provide a better developer experience for Kubernetes apps. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UaaC"
