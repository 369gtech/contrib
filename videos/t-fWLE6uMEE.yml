description: "Nan Li, Medidata Solutions\n\nModel-based testers design abstract tests in terms of models such as paths in graphs. Then the abstract tests need to be converted to concrete tests, which are defined in terms of implementation. The transformation from abstract tests to concrete tests have to be automated. Existing model-based testing techniques for behavioral models use many additional diagrams such as class diagrams and use case diagrams for test transformation and generation. They are very complicated to use in practice because testers have to make all related diagrams consistent all the time even when requirements are changed frequently.\n\nThis talk introduces a test automation language to allow testers to generate tests by using only one behavioral model such as a state machine diagram. Three issues will be addressed: (1) creating mappings from models to executable test code and generating test values, (2) transforming graphs and using coverage criteria to generate test paths, and (3) solving constraints and generating concrete tests."
