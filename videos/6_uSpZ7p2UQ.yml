recordingDate: 1413784067
description: "DevDay (http://devday.pl)\n26th of September 2014\n\nSeb Rose - \"So Long, and Thanks for All the Tests\"\n\n\"TDD has long been recommended by agile practitioners, but the community still argues about how to go about it. Inside-out or outside-in? Mockist or classical? Through a component's public API or for every class? And then there's Kent Beck's famous quote: “I get paid for code that works, not for tests, so my philosophy is to test as little as possible to reach a given level of confidence.” This introduces a further level of subjectivity, especially since developers are frequently overconfident.\n\nIn this session, Seb will explore the choices that agile teams need to make when considering which development practices to adopt. He'll look again at some of the arguments for the different approaches and urge teams to practice until you're happy with the way you code.\""
