description: "Abstract: Services 4.0, envisioned by IMDA as part of the Services and Digital Economy Technology Roadmap 2018, is the vision and evolutionary journey for companies to deliver seamless services that are end-to-end, frictionless, empathic and anticipatory to customer needs. As emerging technologies such as Immersive Media and Artificial Intelligence are made more accessible, companies will be able to innovate and create new values quickly to provide seamless services that are designed around customerâ€™s needs. The adoption of Cloud Native Architecture is an important step to accelerate the Services 4.0 journey by providing easier access to emerging technologies to make it more cost-effective, scalable and agile for companies to capture new opportunities in the digital economy.\n\nSpeaker: Howie Lau, Chief Industry Development Officer, IMDA\n\nFilmed at Pivotal Summit 2019 Singapore"
