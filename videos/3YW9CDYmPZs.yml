description: "Building an IoT Cloud for the Healthcare Industry: How to Solve Networking, Security, and Multi-tenancy Challenges and Still Have Fault Tolerance and High Availability - Sergey Sverchkov, Altoros\n\nImagine yourself building an IoT healthcare cloud solution that securely connects to hundreds of private hospital networks and exchanges data with 100,000+ devices via WebSocket, TCP, and HTTP. In this scenario, even private networks routing can become a challenge. Now, add the requirements to encrypt and store customer data separately, run the pool of shared applications in Cloud Foundry for customer multi-tenancy, and integrate authentication with customer directory services. What you will get is a very complex project that must thoroughly address all aspects of building a shared and secure private cloud. In this talk, we will concentrate on the details of networking, security, and multi-tenancy implementations for an IoT cloud-based healthcare solution and reveal the architecture principles of device adapters that allow for seamless integration of new devices.\n\nAbout Sergey Sverchkov\nSergey Sverchkov has over 15 years of experience in building complex software architectures, database development, and data migration. Since 1996, Sergey has created dozens of enterprise solutions for big data analysis and BI that utilize distributed frameworks (such as Hadoop) and are deployed in public and private cloud infrastructures, including Amazon, Joyent, Rackspace, OpenStack, etc. Sergey is a certified Oracle trainer and a frequent speaker at international IT conferences, e.g., JAX London."
