title: 'RabbitMQ: Message that Just Works (Part 3)'
recordingDate: 1299529860
description: "By Emile Joubert\r\nThe Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) is an application layer protocol for messaging. This talk introduces RabbitMQ, its prominent multi-lingual open-source implementation.\r\n\r\nEmile Joubert, RabbitMQ engineer, will look at the relevance of Erlang/OTP as an implementation platform, the benefits of a messaging system and common messaging patterns. Some important features in recent releases will be discussed with examples. Join us to find out how RabbitMQ can help to scale your application, whether it's on a device, the web, in the data centre or the cloud.\r\n\r\nDue to recording issues, the slides do not synch up with the audio in part 3. The slide (pdf) is available here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.springsource.com/files/uploads/all/webinars/download/RabbitMQ-Messaging%20That%20Just%20Works%2012-9-10.pdf"
