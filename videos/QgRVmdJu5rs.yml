title: 'JeremyBytes - Lambdas & LINQ in C# - Part 3: Declarative Programming with LINQ'
recordingDate: 1429052521
description: 'We''re used to imperative programming in C# -- this is where we tell the computer *how* to accomplish a task. With declarative programming, we tell the computer *what* we want and let it figure out the details. This can make our code much easier to read and understand. And LINQ can help us get there. That''s exactly what we''ll look at today. For more information and code samples, be sure to visit http://www.jeremybytes.com/Demos.aspx#LLL'
