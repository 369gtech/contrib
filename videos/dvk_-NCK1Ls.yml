description: "Deep Dive: Kubernetes (Instrumentation) SIG - Frederic Branczyk & Max Inden, Red Hat \n\nThe SIG Instrumentation deep dive is going to cover some of the details of performance optimizations we have recently been working on, both on a technical level of how they were achieved, but also the results of said optimizations. Beyond that we will dive into advanced topics of how to make use of the data Kubernetes exposes for advanced querying in order to perform monitoring and alerting on Kubernetes clusters. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPjo"
