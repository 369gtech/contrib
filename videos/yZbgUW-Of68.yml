recordingDate: 1549602679
description: "The Future of High Speed Transportation\n\nIn the global marketplace that transfers knowledge at the speed of light, we have a massive time delay and that is modern transportation methods. The hyperloop is the first new mode of transport to be created in over 100 years. The motivation is to connect people, reduce congestion, and protect our planet by eliminating CO2 emissions from terrestrial transport. The hyperloop can best be described as space travel on the ground - a magnetically levitating, electromagnetically propelled, passenger vehicle in a vacuum tube. With the elimination of aerodynamic drag and surface friction, power consumption plummets, speeds can reach 700 mph, and waste and cost are minimized. With the use of autonomy the service is on demand and delays become a thing of the past. Dr. Sengupta will discuss how space-age tech coupled to the VC funded innovation environment are enabling the revolution in green transportation from suborbital rocket flights, to electric airplanes, to space travel on the ground with the hyperloop.\n\nDr. Sengupta is an aerospace engineer and veteran of the space program. Her NASA engineering projects included her PhD research on developing the ion propulsion system for the Dawn Mission (currently in the main asteroid belt), the supersonic parachute that landed the Curiosity rover on Mars, and the Cold Atom Laboratory an atomic physics facility for the International Space Station. Most recently she led the development of the hyperloop systems architecture that will enable ground based travel in excess of airline speed. Her next adventure is designing autonomous air taxis for urban aerial transport and supersonic aircraft.\n\nDr. Sengupta received her MS and PhD in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Southern California, where she is a Resesrch associate professor in the Asronautics and Space Technology deparment teaching spacecraft, entry, and landing system design for planetary exploration. In her spare time she is an avid pilot, motorcyclist, scuba diver, snowboarder, and runner.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
