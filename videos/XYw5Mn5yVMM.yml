description: "Domain-Driven Design Europe 2016 - Brussels, January 27-29 2016\nhttp://dddeurope.com - https://twitter.com/ddd_eu\nDeep conversations with domain experts and careful attention to the language are central in DDD. However it takes many years and many failures to get better at this game.\n\nStill, over time it is possible to extract a growing set of techniques and heuristics that can boost the effectiveness of the interviews with domain experts, to learn faster and converge quickly to better models.\n\nThere are techniques and heuristics for asking better questions, listening carefully to words and other signals, and for managing credibility as a developer facing business experts. Beyond that, there are also some recently found modeling patterns which can also help recognise and clarify Bounded Contexts much earlier.\n\nIf you think all the above is important, then you are likely doing a good job at Domain-Driven Design, and paying attention to interviewing techniques will improve your skills, step up the quality of your collaboration with your domain experts, and will provide many benefits for your domain models. And if you find all that boring, then perhaps you could focus your career on Java EE instead."
