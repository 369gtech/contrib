description: "Technology shapes the world. The more successful a new technology becomes, the more reliant we will become of it. This has always happened and will happen in the future too.\n\nIn many ways, internet is the best and worst innovation done during our lifetime. One example of that is how massive the cybercrime problem has become. How did we get here? And what will happen next?"
