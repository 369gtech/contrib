description: "Video from Devoxx Poland 2019.\n\nReady to see some code? Containers, microservices, GKE, and more. Dive deep into application development, building and deploying an app onto Kubernetes clusters managed by Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) in clouds and on-prem! We will use open source solutions from GCP Marketplace to build an example cloud native application that has a front-end exposing a REST endpoint and a persistent back-end communicating with other components through a message broker. We will take additional security and control benefits that Istio brings to Kubernetes."
