title: '10 Books to Learn Machine Learning'

recordingDate: 1563259359
description: "I've designed an ordered reading list of free books to help anyone learn machine learning efficiently! I'll explain why I chose each book and detail how it fits into the larger learning path. We'll start by learning about how the original learning algorithm (the human brain) works, then progressively move into more difficult technical subjects in machine learning. By the end, i'll have you learning about the cutting edge of machine learning (causal reasoning) and ideating as to how quantum machine learning will help drive the field forward. From beginner to doing cutting edge research in 10 books, enjoy! \n\nIt would mean so much to me if you subscribe to my YouTube Channel! \nhttps://bit.ly/2SvhG7v\n\nBook List:\n\nBook #1: Incognito: the Secret Lives of the Brain by David Eaglemann\nhttps://fatimekerimli.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/david-eagleman-incognito.pdf\n\nBook #2 - How Smart Machines think by Sean Gerrish (sign up to scribd for free, download the book, then cancel your trial so its free)\nhttps://www.scribd.com/document/404218564/How-Smart-Machines-Think-Sean-Gerrish-pdf\n\nBook #3 - The Hundred Page Machine Learning Book by Andrej Burkov \nhttps://github.com/ZakiaSalod/The-Hundred-Page-Machine-Learning-Book\n\nBook #4 - Python Machine Learning 2nd Edition by Sebastian Reschka\nhttps://github.com/rasbt/python-machine-learning-book-2nd-edition\n\nBook #5 - Grokking Deep Learning by Andrew Trask\nhttps://github.com/ontiyonke/Free-Deep-Learning-Books/blob/master/book/Grokking%20Deep%20Learning%20-%20MEAP%20v10.pdf\n\nBook #6 - Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Methods for Hackers by Cameron Davidson\nhttps://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers\n\nBook #7 - Doing Data Science: Straight Talk From The Frontline by Rachel Schutt\nhttps://github.com/SayantanMitra87/Data-Science-Books-1/blob/master/Doing%20Data%20Science%20Straight%20Talk%20from%20the%20Frontline.pdf\n\nBook #8 - Reinforcement Learning by Sutton and Barto\nhttp://incompleteideas.net/book/bookdraft2017nov5.pdf\n\nBook #9 - The Book of Why by Judea Pearl\nhttps://www.academia.edu/36682718/_Judea_Pearl_and_Dana_Mackenzie_The_Book_of_Why_b-ok.xyz_\n\nBook #10 - Quantum Machine Learning by Peter Wittek\nhttps://doc.lagout.org/Others/Data%20Mining/Quantum%20Machine%20Learning_%20What%20Quantum%20Computing%20Means%20to%20Data%20Mining%20%5BWittek%202014-08-28%5D.pdf\n\nWant more education?
