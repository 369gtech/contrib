description: "Kotlin is a language for the JVM, invented by JetBrains a few years ago. But what the hell is Kotlin EE? If you have never heard of Kotlin EE, don't panic, it does not exist. But you can use it right away and boost your productivity!\n\nI invented the term Kotlin EE as a synonym for using the Kotlin language together with the Java EE API to create services of any size (microservices, nanoservices etc.) with just a few lines of code and the ability to focus on the business logic.\n\nKotlin and Java EE are a perfect couple for writing micro- or nanoservices. Kotlin is a very pragmatic language, builds on many concepts and techniques from Java, and designed for developer productivity. The Java EE API allows us to code against a proven and stable API. Provided libraries like JAX-RS for writing RESTful APIs and Jackson for JSON (de)serializing decrease the need for additional third-party libraries which results in a short build time and a small artifact size. Benefit from the very fast build and test feedback and stay focused on your code.\n\nIn this talk, I try to prove my above statements. Live on stage I write a service in Kotlin with a RESTful JSON API with only a few lines of code, and run the service using a local Docker cloud. You can see how these can be scaled up and down to manage fluctuating loads.\n\nCoding, building, testing, deploying, scaling: fast and efficient!\n\nMarcus Fihlon is an Agile Coach and Software Engineer at CSS Insurance in Lucerne. He also lectures at TEKO Swiss Technical College in Olten and is a speaker at conferences and user groups. He has been developing software for more than three decades and has worked with Java since the late 90s. Marcus is the grounding member and organizer of the monthly Hackergarten in Lucerne and is involved in several open source projects. Since 2017, he is a member of the board of the Java User Group Switzerland and responsible for organizing events and workshops in central Switzerland."
