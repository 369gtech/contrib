description: "A successful commercial programming language must be instantly familiar to its target audience. It must be engineered to deal with the challenges of todays systems. It must innovate and yet not over innovate. Dart, Google’s new web language, follows this approach and provides high performance on today’s web browsers. In contrast, Newspeak is a work of uncompromising idealism implemented on a figurative shoestring. Yet both languages share a common philosophy favoring pure object orientation and network awareness. Both languages support variations on features such as mirror based reflection, actor based concurrency, optional types and mixins. In this talk, we’ll compare the two languages/platforms and discuss why and how specific differences arose despite the commonality.\n\nGilad Bracha is the creator of the Newspeak programming language and a software engineer at Google where he works on Dart. Previously, he was a VP at SAP Labs, a Distinguished Engineer at Cadence, and a Computational Theologist and Distinguished Engineer at Sun. He is co-author of the Java Language Specification, and a researcher in the area of object-oriented programming languages. Prior to joining Sun, he worked on Strongtalk, the Animorphic Smalltalk System. He received his B.Sc in Mathematics and Computer Science from Ben Gurion University in Israel and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Utah.\n\nFor more on YOW!
