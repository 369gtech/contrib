description: "\"Machine Learning for Everyone\nEuroPython 2020 - Talk - 2020-07-24 - Parrot Data Science\nOnline\n\nBy Aaron Ma\n\nMachine learning (ML) is becoming an essential technology for our day to day life. Stop taking ML as a threat and learn it today as not learning it is a HUGE LOSS! Get started today with ML in Aaron's remarkable 45-mins talk. We will begin by talking about the paradigm of ML, then taking a deep dive into Neural Networks and building a Neural Network from scratch with Keras and TensorFlow (the hottest machine learning framework). You'll master the magic of neural networks that are powering incredible advances both in AI, self-driving cars, and much more! Finally, we will finish off by talking about Reinforcement learning and how it is empowering YouTube suggestions along with tips-and-tricks from a specialist plus a grand finale mind-blowing demo. Ready to master the paradigm of ML? Let's get started.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2020.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/\n\n    \""
