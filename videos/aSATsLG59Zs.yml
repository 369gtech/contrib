description: "Join us in March 21-23 for Devoxx US 2017, details @ https://devoxx.us \n\nContainers are enabling developers to package their applications in new ways that are portable and work consistently everywhere. Docker has become the de facto standard for those portable containers in the cloud. Kubernetes provides an open source orchestration of Docker containers. This tutorial will provide an introduction to Docker and Kubernetes. The talk will explain several recipes on how to create and publish Docker images that package Java EE applications. Design patterns and anti-patterns that show how to create cluster of such applications will be shown. Replicating your environments using Docker images will be shown. Attendees will learn how Kubernetesâ€™s self-healing mechanism can be used to create cluster of these containers."
