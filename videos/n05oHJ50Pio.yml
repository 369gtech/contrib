description: ".NET Summit 2020 Online Edition https://dotnetsummit.by - the 4th community driven .NET conference dedicated to practical experience of solving business challenges with .NET and technical challenges in .NET application\n\nDan Patrascu-Baba, Architecting Blazor applications – An Angular inspired approach [EN]\n\nBlazor is already an established framework within the .NET ecosystem that helps developers deliver Single-Page Application experiences with .NET only technologies. A common question that arises is: how should we architect our Blazor applications? Since Blazor is essentially a SPA framework, I think that it would be beneficial to borrow some patterns and practices from Angular. \n\nDuring the talk we'll go over some important topics like structuring Blazor components, component communication techniques and we'll explore the idea of Micro-UIs using Blazor components, similar to Angular Elements. All discussion points will be backed by demos from a Blazor application to showcase the different patterns and practices.\n\nGeneral Partner - ISsoft - https://issoft.by"
