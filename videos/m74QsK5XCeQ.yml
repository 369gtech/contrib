description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2012.\nSpeakers:  Roy Clarkson and Gunnar Hillert\n(We apologize in advance for the recording quality on the screen, hopefully it's workable.)\n\nOver the last year a number of significant changes have been made to the infrastructure and processes used within the Spring family of projects. In this presentation we will review these process changes and provide valuable insights into the tools that make it all possible. We will begin with providing a brief history, then move on to discuss the new tools being used, such as GitHub, Gradle, and Artifactory. Beyond describing the tools, we'll also illustrate how these new tools help facilitate our processes, including community contributions, release management, defect tracking, and more. Ultimately, this presentation will paint a larger picture of the development process for open source projects at Spring, and the various outlets available for community involvement."
