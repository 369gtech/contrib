description: "Reducing Mean-Time-to-Detection of Incidents with an Envoy Service Mesh - Constance Caramanolis, Lyft \n\nIncident management is inherently stressful and is made worse when the diagnostics and observability data is lacking and heterogenous. Lyft runs Envoy at every hop of the network providing best in class observability across the entirety of Lyft’s network topology. Homogenous data reduces the time it takes to identify production issues. This talk will simulate a production incident at Lyft and guide the attendees through a page from the dreaded PagerDuty notification to resolution, by showing how engineers use Envoy’s extensive observability to identify and root cause the incident and remedy the situation, thus reducing mean time to resolution. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/GraX"
