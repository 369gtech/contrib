description: "Code is here: http://goo.gl/O4fZD\n\nAfter I made my XML Video Tutorial, you asked me to show you how to parse XML with Java. So, that is what I'm doing in this tutorial.\n\nI wasn't sure how much to cover, because I could literally create a 5 part series on this topic. I decided to cover the basics in the video and provide another example in the code below.\n\nIf you want to see more, tell me and I'll cover more on parsing XML with Java."
