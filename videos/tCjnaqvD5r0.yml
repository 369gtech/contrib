recordingDate: 1506522367
description: "Containers are on everybody’s to-do list these days. If you search through the schedules of any tech conference you’ll find at least one talk which touches the topic of containers.\_\nFollowing the DevOps Movement and enabling your employees making use of new technologies opens new ways of finding solutions to problems.\n\n„Containers give Developers way to much power, they can do whatever they want on production - I hate containers“ - A Sysadmin 2017\n\nDoes this sound familiar? Talking to a lot of people within the realm of DevOps I hear very positive and also very negative voices when it comes to containers. Let’s discover what holds people back adopting this amazing new technology!\n\nThere is a lot of excitement on the topic - which is great, but barely anyone is using containers in production (unless you are Netflix, Visa, Alibaba, Paypal). Some of the people we talked to are scared and some are holding back because „this is not the technology which will be there in 5 years“. We believe that there is not enough understanding of how containers work, or how to use them.\n\nIn this session, we’d like to give an insight into the status of Containers how we use them and where we see the benefits, for Drupal and beyond.\n\nIn this session we will cover\n\nWhat are Containers?\nThe current state of containers\_\nBenefits of using containers\nCommon Pitfalls\nHow we started implementing docker\nComparison of Docker development tools for Drupal"
