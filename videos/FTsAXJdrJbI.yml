description: "Stack traces and heap dumps are not just debugging tools; they open a doorway to the very heart of the Java Virtual Machine. This session is focused on peculiarities of JDK somehow related to heap walking and thread stacks.\n\n\nHow to create dumps in production without side effects?\nWhat is the performance impact of getting stack traces?\nHow do jmap and jstack work under the hood, and what is special about 'forced' mode?\nWhy do sampling profilers lie, and how to deal with it?\nWhat is good about Stack-Walking API (JEP 259) in Java 9?\n\nThe presentation supported by the live demo will address all these questions and more. It will also reveal some useful but little known features of HotSpot JVM."
