description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nThe Quest for the Ultimate Kubernetes Homelab - Dan Garfield, Codefresh \n\nWe go way beyond the basic Raspberry Pi builds you've seen before. Built on x86, with autoscaling, networking, stateful services, on the cheap and with every single infrastructure component defined as code. Dan will share his quest for the ultimate Kubernetes homelab both to provide services for the home and family as well as implement all the components of an enterprise grade system. We'll look at node operating systems, how to build-on power management with node scaling/shutdown, which Kubernetes implementation to use and how to automate the entire thing so you can stand it up and down from scratch in minutes. The quest for the ultimate Kubernetes homelab brings all the components of DevOps and infrastructure management for a homelab nirvana. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ekBG"
