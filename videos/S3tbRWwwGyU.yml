description: "Titel: Carving Microservices out of the Monolith with Domain Storytelling\n\nFor a microservices architecture to be succesful it is crucial to have the right boundaries between the microservices. But where are the right boundaries? I would like to present a tool that helps us answer this question.\n\nDomain Storytelling (www.domainstorytelling.org) means that we let our users tell us stories about their work. While listening, we record the stories using a pictographic language. The experts can immediately see if we understand their story. After very few stories, we understand the language of our users and find different areas of the domain. Each of these areas (called a subdomain) is a good candicate to become a microservice in our architecture.\n\nIn this talk I show how to find subdomains and which heuristics can help us.\n\nSpeaker: Henning Schwentner - Coder, Coach - Consultant\nHenning loves to code. He follows this passion as a software architect and consultant at WPS – Workplace Solutions in Hamburg, Germany. His projects are domain-driven designed, agile and in programming languages like Java, C# and even ABAP. Henning is interested in the evolution of programming languages, long-living software architectures and big refactorings. Recently he translated »Domain-Driven Design distilled« into german. Henning is married and has children."
