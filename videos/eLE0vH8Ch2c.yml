description: "From the New Museum in New York to Palais de Tokyo in Paris to TED Global in Vancouver to Comic Con in San Diego, Aramique has spent the past decade creating interactive installations and immersive experiences for top brands, in collaboration with renown musicians and as part of major festivals and museums. His work has always lived in a blurry grey area between art and commerce.\n\nSince he entered into the field that is now called “experiential” the industry shifted dramatically. All of his earlier projects felt like art installations that were funded by brand patronage. The PR coming out of the project was largely about him as an artist. Today, as budgets have grown and the industry has matured, with hundreds of artists and studios doing similar art/tech work, there has been a massive shift away from the artist as the focus to the fan selfie as the holy grail. For some, it has diminished the value of our work and created a new metric of success measured in photos taken and tagged. Others aren’t as critical, embracing the newfound interest as ultimately a positive opportunity.\n\nThis new paradigm has changed the relationship of the fan from a more passive participant to the performer who owns the relationship to the work and how the public perceives it. Together, we will investigate the commodification of experience and the opportunity for storytelling, art and technology to create a new discourse beyond the selfie. Aramique will draw on his body of work over the past 10 years as well as trends he has witnessed across major cities around the world to give context on where we’ve been and try to predict where we are headed as an “experience industry.”\n\nAramique\ntoolofna.com\nhttps://twitter.com/aramique\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttps://fitc.ca/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=video-description\n\nSave 10% off any FITC event with discount code 'youtube'.\nSee our upcoming events at https://fitc.ca/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=video-description"
