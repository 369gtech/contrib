title: 'Petri Kero | Building a Scalable, Distributed Backend for Mobile Games'
recordingDate: 1496407945
description: "Filmed in Barcelona at ElixirConf EU 2017\n\nSuccessful mobile games have huge amounts of simultaneous users, which requires a scalable server in the backend. Getting featured in a store can also cause a rapid rapid ramp-up, putting even further pressure on the scalability of the backend. In this talk I'll present how Ministry of Games is tackling the scalability problem with distributed Elixir. I will cover how our system is implemented in Elixir as well as some practical aspects of deploying the Elixir server to a Kubernetes cluster.\n\nElixirConf EU is a community conference created to promote education, networking and collaboration within the Elixir/Erlang/Ruby communities."
