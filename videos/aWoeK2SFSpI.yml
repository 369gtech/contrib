description: "Augmenting Empathy: Simulating Low-Vision Conditions with CSS, SVG and WebRTC\n\n“Low-vision” is a concept which is hard to grasp for most people in an exact manner. Its an umbrella term for a number of conditions - each affecting eyesight in a different way. What if we could make tools to make people see what people with low-vision actually see?\n\nThis talk is a story of how I talked to persons with low vision and their family members, and tried to make tools to help people understand how people with various low-vision conditions see the world. Through the power of CSS, SVG and WebRTC, we’ll take a look at how to simulate low-vision conditions and what it taught me about empathy.\n\nCSSconf EU will be back on May 31st 2019: https://2019.cssconf.eu/"
