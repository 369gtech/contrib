description: "Securing Application Telemetry & Tracing with SPIFFE and Envoy - Sabree Blackmon, Docker \n\nApplication telemetry, such as Prometheus metrics, distributed logs, and tracing, offer a surplus of information on how an app works, how it's performing, what itâ€™s communicating with and how. However, even when these streams do not contain PII, this information can be invaluable to malicious actors in the days of highly distributed systems.
