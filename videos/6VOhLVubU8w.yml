description: "Bisection method is the first root finding method we will study. It allows us to find good estimates for otherwise difficult to calculate solutions.\n\nFor information on why it's important to choose a good value for epsilon: http://realtimecollisiondetection.net/pubs/GDC05_Ericson_Numerical_Robustness_for_Geometric_Calculations.ppt\n\nWatch Blue Ocean: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JXZ85KLVVw\nSource code for Blue Ocean: https://github.com/BSVino/BlueOcean\n\nFind the source code here: https://github.com/BSVino/MathForGameDevelopers/tree/numerical-bisection\n\nNew video every Thursday.
