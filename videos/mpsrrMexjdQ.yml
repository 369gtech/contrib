description: "Attendee Preparation:\n\nThis talk will cover a lot of rather advanced topics including containerization, continuous integration, and automated testing. Attendees should have familiarization with Docker, common PHP testing frameworks, and how continuous integration platforms work.\n\nProblem:\n\nTime is wasted and quality suffers when there is no agreed upon process for onboarding new developers into a project, running project tests (you wrote tests right?), and deploying the project to your staging infrastructure. Time = money, Quality = money. Your team needs predictable and easy to use systems and processes that free up brainpower and creativity to deliver amazing web work.\n\nSolution:\n\nUse an open source, cross-platform set of tooling and appropriate infrastructure (Docker, CI services, a scriptable host) along with a zero config solution for setting up your projects. Remove all decisions from collaborators so they can focus solely on delivering their feature work.\n\nHow:\n\nMake the experience of adding a new developer as quick, painless and low friction as possible\nSet a consistent development environment, no matter the preferences or hardware of your team.\_\nMake all daily tasks (tests, pull-requests, environment sync) effortless.\nMake your infrastructure inviting to extend with scripts your whole team can contribute to.\nTakeaways:\n\nAttendees should leave this session with a clear understanding of the value of:\n\nstandardization of development environments\nautomation of intricate but highly repetitive\_tasks\nin relation to:\n\nThe quality of life of their development staff\nThe profitability of their projects\nThe quality of the work they produce."
