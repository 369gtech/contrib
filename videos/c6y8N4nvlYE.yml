title: 'DrupalCon New Orleans 2016: Content-Driven UX'
recordingDate: 1462905233
description: "As a web agency gains in “scope confidence,” it gradually (and sometimes painfully) evolves from:\n\nan agency that considers a project done when it’s code complete (i.e., content is a project risk to be mitigated) to\na content-oriented strategic partner (i.e., effective content is central to the project mandate and indeed often the rationale for the project)\nThis evolution naturally pushes content considerations earlier and earlier in the process, so that we begin with content even before considering designs and features; and hear alarm bells ringing off when we start creating wireframes with no real content (or at least proto-content).\n\nThis is good - now we’re paying attention.\n\nIn this talk, we discuss how content strategy and UX cannot productively be considered apart from one another. Instead, when we are producing user flows, we’re aiming to understand what content needs to be produced. When we do user testing, we are doing so with content that the user would likely encounter (and value).\n\nArmed with this perspective, an agency can finally start to help a client plan its content effectively within a web redesign project, and ensure content is driving the UX process.\n\nThis talk will help participants:\n\nidentify strategies for incorporating content strategy into UX\nexplain to project stakeholders how and why to begin content planning earlier\nhelp UX designers on the project succeed by providing them with real content with which to apply relevant solutions"
