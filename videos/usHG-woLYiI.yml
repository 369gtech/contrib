Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nHow Ancestry Got Kubernetes to Run 2x Better Per Dollar Using AI - Darek Gajewski, Ancestry \n\nDarek Gajewski, Principal Infrastructure Analyst for Ancestry.com, relies on Kubernetes to quickly integrate and deploy applications across Ancestry’s website, which receives 50-million visitors a month, and generates more than a billion dollars in revenue.    To get optimum performance out of Ancestry’s cloud applications, Ancestry employed artificial intelligence for continuous optimization of the application runtime environment. AI brings continuous optimization (CO) to the CI/CD process. In a PoC, Ancestry used AI to cut the resources of one application by more than 50 percent, with zero drop in performance. In this instance, Ancestry has been able to get two times the performance out of Kubernetes for every dollar spent.    AI-powered CO delivers a well-optimized infrastructure personalized to the workload and delivers better reliability, at higher performance, for much lower costs. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UaZ5"
