description: "Over the course of the last year, Comcast has matured its Cloud Foundry platform from proof-of-concept to production ready. The platform currently supports some of our most critical applications while also being an incubator for more innovation. Transitioning to a new platform is never easy and we have had to win over skeptics with operational excellence. Join us to hear about how we: \n\n· Monitor and Alert on Cloud Foundry KPIs \n· Certify the resilience of Cloud Foundry \n· Manage and Maintain Cloud Foundry\n\nNeville George\nCloud Engineer, Comcast\nNeville George is a Cloud Engineer at Comcast. He plays a key role in promoting, managing and supporting PaaS initiatives within the company. He has a passion for automation and more recently open-source tools so doesn't have to pay \"full-price for fabulous\". When he needs a break from his warm chair, you will find him at a ping pong table or flinging bags into a cornhole board - though neither contributing to his biceps.\n\nTim Leong\nPrincipal Architect, Comcast Cable\nCloud Engineer at Comcast. Currently working on supporting and operating Pivotal Cloud Foundry and many other Cloud initiatives at Comcast. Last year, I spoke at the CF summit about our journey towards production. This year, we are running production workloads, and the platform is successful under our watch."
