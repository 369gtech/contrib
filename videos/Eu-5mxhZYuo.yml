recordingDate: 1558658123
description: "A medley of programming languages can found in use today: Python, Javascript, Go, C++, even Haskell, but where did they come from? Time to go digging through the history books! This is a comparison of the birth and evolution of seven different languages. Some languages such as C++ and Java share a common ancestry and are semantically very similar. Others, such as Haskell and Ruby are more distantly related. We’re going to go back to the beginning of programming languages and see how they evolved into the languages of today. We’ll learn more about the strange and twisted heritage of: C/C++, Java, Python, Ruby, Javascript, Go, and Haskell, with a few shoutouts to others.\n\nJennifer Manning, software engineer at IBM Watson presents"
