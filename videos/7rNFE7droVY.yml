title: 'LYNDA GIRVAN - Business Agility - a personal journey'
recordingDate: 1639752296
description: 'Being a truly agile organisation is something most aspire to, especially in a Volatile, Uncertain, Ambiguous and Complex (VUCA) world. Today, many organisations are looking to reinvent themselves or their products and services in order to align with market trends and keep up with technological developments. This coupled with demand from consumers for the new and exciting means that organisations and leaders must respond and adapt faster than ever before just to stay in business. To achieve this, many are looking to undertake their own business agility transformation journeys. But what does ‘being’ an agile organisation mean and how hard is it to do? As well as supporting clients in business agility, Lyn Girvan will share how she has shone a light on her own organisation, CMC Partnership Consultancy Ltd, and taken them on their own personal discovery journey into business agility. In this talk Lynda will provide: An understanding of business agility and the benefits to be achieved through an agile transformation. Identify key challenges facing organisations and leaders who want to achieve business agility. Share her personal journey in taking CMC on their own path to achieving organizational agility including: Challenges overcome. Success, and failures experienced. Cultural benefits achieved. Leadership challenges.'
