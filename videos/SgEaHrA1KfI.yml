description: "Recording brought to you by American Express https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs\nAt trivago, we use Apache Kafka a lot. We recently migrated a good part of our Kafka-related Java code to Kotlin. In this talk we focus on how extension functions and the closure syntax make things pretty when using Kafka Streams.\n\nAbout the Presenter:\nMario Mueller leads a team of brave people at trivago, who fearlessly encounter new technologies like Kafka, Debezium and Kotlin. He is a former database architect who now seeks his destiny in streaming, CDC and reactive systems."
