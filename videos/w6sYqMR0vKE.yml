This isnâ€™t just about creating stunning data vis to music, we see how we can pipe data real-time into custom properties to enhance our visuals. The speaker re-addresses how we analyze sound via the Web Audio API and proposes a better way of processing the data to better suit music, and to top it all off, we harness the Web MIDI API for full hardware control as well. \n\nYou may not think it, but this really is a talk with a lot of takeaways and new techniques for you to consider in your coding life.\n\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/wearedevelopers.org/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/wearedevs/\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/wearedevelopers.org/"
