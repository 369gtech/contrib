description: 'While Elm pretty much solves the tool and framework fatigue when starting a new front-end project, we still have the same issue for the back-end. Using Horizon in your Elm app can help alleviate the pain by reducing the amount of work you have to do in the back-end, so you can write more Elm code.'
