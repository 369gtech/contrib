title: 'Bootiful Development with Spring Boot and React - Matt Raible'
language: ""
recordingDate: 1513269138
description: "To simplify development and deployment, you want everything in the same artifact, so you put your React app “inside” your Spring Boot app, right? But what if you could create your React app as a standalone app and make cross-origin requests to your API? A client app that can point to any server makes it easy to test your current client code against other servers (e.g. test, staging, production). This session shows how to develop with Java 8, Spring Boot, React, and TypeScript. You’ll learn how to create REST endpoints with Spring MVC, configure Spring Boot to allow CORS, and create an React app to display its data. If time allows we’ll cover authentication with OpenID Connect and deployment to Cloud Foundry.\nMatt Raible, Developer Advocate, Okta\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2017"
