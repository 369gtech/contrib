language: English
recordingDate: 1411351414
description: "etcd provides easy to use distributed locking and service discovery. It has an accessible HTTP+JSON API that exposes a powerful set of primitives inspired by projects like Google's Chubby and Apache Zookeeper. This talk will cover the underlying consensus algorithm, the architecture of the code, introduce the API and survey the libraries and tools that have been built by the etcd community.\n\nThe project is open source and available on github: github.com/coreos/etcd\n\nBrandon Philips\nCoreOS\n@brandonphilips\n\nBrandon Philips is helping to build modern Linux server infrastructure at CoreOS. Because of this, he was recently disowned by one of his Linux kernel friends for being \"one of those weirdos on the other side of the sys calls\"."
