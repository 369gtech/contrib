description: "Google Tech Talk\nMay 31, 2013\n(more info below)\n\nABSTRACT\n\nWith the ever-increasing demand for bandwidth, it is critical that we increase the capacity of optical networks. Coherent systems are now able to compensate for linear impairments such as CD and PMD. However, fiber nonlinearity limits the maximum power that systems can operate at; higher optical signal-to-noise ratios (OSNR) cannot be achieved by increasing the power. The capacity of optical links can be significantly increased by fiber nonlinearity compensation. The majority of recent nonlinearity compensation research has focused on using digital techniques such as backpropagation (BP). The computational power required for BP has so far prohibited it from being implemented using real-time digital signal processing (DSP).\nAlternatively, optical techniques can also be used to improve the nonlinearity-limited performance of optical systems. For example optical phase conjugation (OPC) can be performed near the mid-point of the link so the fiber nonlinearity products generated in the second half of the link mitigate the fiber nonlinearity products generated in the first half. There have also been end-link optical techniques proposed. Optical techniques have the advantage of being more scalable to multi-wavelength systems but require modifications to the external plant. \nIn this presentation, an overview of both digital and optical nonlinearity compensation will be presented. The advantages and limitations of each method will be discussed for the different optical network topologies, including point-to-point links, mesh optical networks and future super-channel applications. \n\nSPEAKER INFO\n\nLiang Bangyuan Du was born in Shenyang, China in 1985.
