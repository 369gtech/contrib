description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nSecure Your GitOps - How to Implement a Robust Security Strategy - Todd Ekenstam, Intuit\n\nAccess control and security are especially crucial for managing the deployment of applications and infrastructure. Traditional security processes that rely on human operational knowledge will struggle to scale and meet the needs of enterprises utilizing automated build and release infrastructure. The GitOps methodology can improve the integrity and security of your application deployments while at the same time exposing new attack vectors that must be secured.\n\nThis talk will cover the following topics:\n- Improving security with GitOps\n- Implementing access control in GitOps\n- Multi-tenant cluster and namespace management for GitOps\n- Configuring access limitations for critical GitOps components\n- Common security model patterns and best practices\n\nThis talk will teach you how to securely implement a GitOps methodology to deploy applications and cluster components to Kubernetes. You will also learn strategies to securely manage multi-tenant clusters and common security model patterns and best practices."
