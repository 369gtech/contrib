title: 'RailsConf 2020 CE - Building a Mentorship Program by Noel Rappin'
language: English

description: "Building a Mentorship Program by Noel Rappin\n\nMentorship is a great way for a newer developer to benefit from the experience of a more senior developer. While there are lots of available resources on how to be a good mentor or mentee, there are far fewer guidelines on how to set up a mentoring program within your engineering organization. I'm doing this now, and I'll share the process with you: why we decided to start a team-wide mentorship program, how we got volunteers and how we matched them, and how we followed up and what worked and what didn't. You'll get everything you need to start a mentorship program at your organization.\n\n__________\n\nNoel Rappin is a Staff Engineer at Root Insurance. Noel has authored multiple technical books, including \"Modern Front End Development For Rails\" and \"Rails 5 Test Prescriptions\". He also hosted the podcast Tech Done Right.
