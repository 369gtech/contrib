recordingDate: 1616142824
description: "We are in a time when most of us are experiencing mixed feelings in a very tricky situation. This can be very difficult to manage and the strategies we use to successfully regulate feelings of high intensity over an extended period of time have had to change.\n\nThis webinar looks at understanding feelings and offers some top tips for managing them. It will examine the importance of emotions, the effects they can have on our thoughts and behaviour and things that can be done to help reduce the risk of overwhelming emotions becoming a barrier in our lives.\n\n**Aimed at anyone who has emotions and would like to know more about them.**\n\n## About Amy\n\nWith over 20 years of experience in developing Essential Skills and helping remove barriers to engagement and learning, I have had the pleasure of working within both private and public sector environments. I'm a qualified teacher with an MEd and a passion for helping others reach their potential.\n\nSeven and a half years ago set up Alpha Inclusion and Communication.\n\nAlpha Inclusion and Communication develops the essential skills of individuals, teams, and organisations and helps businesses become more accessible for their clients and workforce.\n\nAs well as running our small and brilliant team, I have had the opportunity to write three books - Building Blocks for Communication (Routledge), Social Survival for the Logical Thinker (Routledge) and Interventions with Impact (Optimus Education) and develop training and personalised programmes for improving the Essential Skills that continue to top the list of must-haves for all employers."
