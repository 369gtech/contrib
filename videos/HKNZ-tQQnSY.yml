description: "In this keynote presentation from HTML5DevConf, Steve Souders, Google's Head Performance Engineer, clarifies the problem of caching, and explores various solutions to make your web app lightning fast.\n\n40-60% of users visit your site with an empty cache at least once each day. 58% of resources don't have caching headers, even though 38% of them go unchanged for weeks. The browser cache is small. We're told localStorage is bad for performance. Is it? Does it depend on how it's used? Application cache is full of gotchas. Join Steve as he clears the confusion with real data.\n\n** To watch the video and follow along with Steve's slides, head to http://mrkn.co/3wzua\n\n** We've got tons and tons more presentations from HTML5DevConf!
