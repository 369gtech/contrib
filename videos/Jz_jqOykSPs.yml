recordingDate: 1552471145
description: "AMP provides users with instant loading experiences, and we need the web platform to do the same. This session describes the various web platform capabilities we're adding to enable pages to instantly load and what will developers need to do to take advantage of those capabilities. Yoav talks about features such as signed exchanges, bundles, feature policies and portals as well as user-centric metrics such as FCP++, First-Input-Delay and Layout Stability.\n\nYoav Weiss is currently part of the Google Chrome Developer Relations team. He has been working on mobile web performance for longer than he cares to admit, on the server side as well as in browsers."
