This cloud native architecture is helping fuel a revolution that provides reduced costs, lower latency, increased bandwidth, and enhanced flexibility for 5G and edge cloud deployments.\n\nThese benefits, however, come with new challenges to deliver end-to-end quality of service, security, and multi-edge/multi-cloud deployments. In this session Rajesh Gadiyar shares his insights about how we’ve collaborated as a CNCF community to meet these challenges by examining a few examples of real-world solutions."
