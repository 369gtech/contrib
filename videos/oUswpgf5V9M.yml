title: 'SC London 2017 (Day 2) Understanding Understandability by Michael Feathers'
language: English
recordingDate: 1508257004
description: "Believe it or not there was a time when many people in the industry felt that OO was too hard for the average programmer. Yet here we are taking an industry plunge into functional programming and tooling that would’ve tested the limits of what people could tolerate just ten years ago. We underestimate ourselves and we do it over and over again because we conflate cultural understandability with cognitive understandability.\n\nIn this talk, Michael Feathers will talk about what we know about computational understanding and where we might end up if we accept that it changes over time.\n\n// This talk was given by Michael Feathers at SC London 2017, a conference dedicated to Craftsmanship values, XP practices & clean code.
