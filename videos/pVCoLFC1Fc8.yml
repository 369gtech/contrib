title: 'Implementing GitOps best practices with Crossplane and ArgoCD'
recordingDate: 1636437094
description: "GitOps is a rising modern software delivery practice of using Git as a single source of truth for all of our resources. This allows for advanced and rapid continuous integration/continuous deployment processes through tools such as ArgoCD.But what about managing not just your app code in Git, but infrastructure as well? GitOps allows for best practices around infrastructure management too. In this session, Anaïs will showcase getting started with Crossplane, a tool to manage your entire infrastructure through Kubernetes-based resources. After providing an overview of the goals that GitOps-based tools help us achieve, we will explore Crossplane further. The demo will show you how to get started with Crossplane, all the way to creating and managing a Kubernetes cluster on Civo through GitOps.\n___________________________\nFoo Café is a meeting place for people with an interest in software development and IT. \nHere, user groups and partner companies find the perfect atmosphere for sharing knowledge and develop competence. \nFoo Café is open for everyone and is free to attend.
