description: "Titel: The Big Cloud Native FaaS Lebowski\n\nOnly a few years ago the move towards microservice architecture was the first big disruption in software engineering: instead of running monoliths, systems were now build, composed and run as autonomous services. But this came at the price of added development and infrastructure complexity. Serverless and FaaS seem to be the next disruption, they are the logical evolution trying to address some of the inherent technology complexity we are currently faced when building cloud native apps.\n\nFaaS frameworks are currently popping up like mushrooms: Knative, Kubeless, OpenFn, Fission, OpenFaas or Open Whisk are just a few to name. But which one of these is safe to pick and use in your next project? Let's find out. This session will start off by briefly explaining the essence of Serverless application architecture. We will then define a criteria catalog for FaaS frameworks and continue by comparing and showcasing the most promising ones.\n\nSpeaker: Mario-Leander Reimer - QAware GmbH - Principal Software Architect #CloudNativeNerd\n\nMario-Leander is a principal software architect, passionate developer and #CloudNativeNerd working for QAware GmbH. He is continuously looking for innovations in software engineering and ways to combine and apply state-of-the-art technology in real-world projects. Currently he is responsible for several projects concerned with the cloud native evolution of legacy applications. He is a regular speaker at national and international conferences and he is teaching cloud computing as a part time lecturer."
