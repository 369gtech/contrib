description: "Kiki do you love me? The hip-hop artist Drake recently released a song called \"in My Feelings' that has become a viral dance challenge. Everyone from Will Smith, to Ciara, to suburban dentists are showing off their dance moves to this popular song as part of the challenge. But rather than submit myself dancing, I've submitted an AI doing it for me. I'll detail how i did it in this video, concluding with a coding challenge. \n\nCoding challenge:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/InMyFeelings_Challenge\n\nPlease Subscribe! And like. And comment.
