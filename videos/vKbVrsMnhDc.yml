description: "Filmed at https://2019.dotgo.eu on March 25th in Paris. More talks on https://dotconferences.com/talks\n\nHow should I structure my code? What design works best for Go apps? Is there an alternative to the classic flat file or MVC structures? Kat answers those questions by introducing the \"ports & adapters\" - or more commonly known as \"hexagonal\" - architecture. She illustrates how it makes projects more testable, maintainable and easy to understand."
