description: "Linkerd 2.7 significantly advances the promise of zero trust security in Kubernetes. This security-themed release adds support for integrating Linkerd’s mutual TLS infrastructure with external certificate issuers such as Vault and cert-manager, improves gitops workflows by allowing Linkerd manifests to be generated without secrets and makes it easy to rotate TLS credentials. The features in this release improve dashboard performance, usability of Helm charts and much more.\n\nPresenter: Oliver Gould, Lead Creator of Linkerd and CTO @Buoyant"
