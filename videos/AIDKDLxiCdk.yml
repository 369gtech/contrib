title: 'Introducing Knative: Build, Deploy, and Manage Serverless Workloads on Kubernetes by David Currie'
language: English
recordingDate: 1557993684
description: 'The Knative project provides the building blocks for creating a serverless platform on top of Kubernetes. It is, for example, the foundation of Google''s Serverless Add-on for GKE, Pivotal''s Function Service and TriggerMesh''s Knative Lambda Runtime. The build project, and its newer counterpart, pipeline, provide for continuous integration. The serving project utilizes Istio to provide a simple serverless deployment and execution model. The final piece in the jigsaw is the nascent eventing project that supports event-based microservice communication. This presentation will show how each of the projects can be used in isolation, and conclude with a demonstration of the power of the platform when all three are used in combination.'
