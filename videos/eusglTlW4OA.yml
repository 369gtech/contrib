description: "PyData DC 2018\n\nThis talk introduces Dash, an open-source library for building interactive data exploration web apps in pure Python. With Dash, scientists, engineers, analysts and other Python developers can build apps for themselves, their colleagues and their customers to visually explore, understand and monitor diverse data sets. We will cover Dash basics by building up a sample application from scratch.\n\nSlides - https://dash-demo.plotly.host/presentation\n===\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
