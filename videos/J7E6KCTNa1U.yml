description: "Nowadays development teams change applications faster and more frequent than ever before. More companies and teams move towards the DevOps way of working to be able to handle the increased development speed. GitOps is a flavour of the DevOps practice where operations and infrastructure changes are made through pull-requests. Any developer can then do production infrastructure changes as long as they can open a pull-request. Git becomes the single source of truth for everything. GitOps require us to declare our entire infrastructure and configuration in code, using tools like Terraform, CloudFormation, Puppet, Chef, among many others. When everything exists as code in Git, you get all the benefits that come with Git. Everything is versioned controlled, have a history, and changes are easy to track. In this session we will discuss the core concepts and benefits of practicing GitOps. How and what to think about, things to avoid, pitfalls, and more. We’ll end with a GitOps in action demo.\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
