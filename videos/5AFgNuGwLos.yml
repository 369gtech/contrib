description: "Did you ever ask yourself: What *really* happens when your Java program runs?\n\nAfter the transformation from Java source through bytecode and machine code to microcode, and the various optimizations that take place along the way, the instructions that are actually executed may be very different from what you imagined when you wrote the program.\n\nThis session shows you tools and techniques for tracing that path.\n\nYou’ll see what a simple program actually looks like when it really hits the hardware.\n\nMaurice Naftalin:\nDeveloper, author, teacher. Forty years in computing. Co-author “Java Generics and Collections”, author “Mastering Lambdas”. JavaOne Rock Star (x4).\n\nDmitry Vyazelenko:\nSoftware developer, conference speaker and a disorganizer of JCrete (http://www.jcrete.org/) and JAlba (http://jalba.scot/) unconferences, passionate about concurrency and performance."
