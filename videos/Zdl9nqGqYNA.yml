description: "For Celia Hodent, a psychology PhD, author, and freelance user experience consultant whose credits include Fortnite, Assassin's Creed games, and more, UX is everywhere.\n\n\"Life is UX!\" said Hodent on the latest episode of the GDC Podcast. She's rightâ€”everything from coffee mugs to door handles to fighter jet cockpits contain varying examples of design meant to improve a user's experience. Of course, UX is key to video game design, too.\n\nListen now on iTunes, Google Play Music, and Spotify\n\niTunes: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/gdc-podcast/id1476405424#episodeGuid=7U38L29L-5VOBT9\n\nGoogle Play: https://play.google.com/music/m/Dnsbxfze2e3mrshtils5rowdo34?t=8_-_Games_Psychology_and_UX_with_Celia_Hodent-GDC_Podcast\n\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/episode/1oiwTxgQoooRQfU8WyHui2?si=4lcuw2exSQmpmm1U0gaiug\n\nJoin the GDC mailing list: http://www.gdconf.com/subscribe\n\nFollow GDC on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Official_GDC \n\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
