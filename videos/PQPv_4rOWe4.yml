description: "PyData NYC/Miami/Philly joint virtual meetup - October 13, 2020\n\nIn the last decade pandas has been growing, and it became a very popular tool for data manipulation and data analysis. But as the number of users grew, the number of use cases also grew, and pandas couldn't adapt to them all. Many other tools have been created to complement pandas for new problems. Some of these tools are Dask, Vaex, Ibis, Modin, cuDF, Koalas, Mars, and Eland.\n\nAll these tools are useful for certain problems, and all of them try to provide a user interface similar to pandas. While having new options is great for users, the ecosystem is becoming increasingly complex and harder to understand. There are dependencies among the different tools, some overlap, different tools trying to solve different problems, and many areas where the different tools could better find synergies.\n\nIn this talk Marc will give a quick overview of the ecosystem, analyze the different components of these systems, and discuss what the future dataframe ecosystem could look like.\n\nAbout the speaker:\n\nMarc Garcia is an Ibis and pandas core developer, a fellow of the Python Software Foundation and a member of the EuroPython Society. Marc has been a co-organizer of the EuroSciPy conference and the PyData Mallorca meetup. He is the founder of the London Python sprints group.\n\nHe has been working with Python for almost 15 years. He works as a machine learning engineering contractor, and has helped companies such as Bumble, Bank of America and Tesco build their data systems.\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
