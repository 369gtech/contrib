description: "Filmed in Barcelona at ElixirConf EU 2017\n\nNextjournal enables living documents for researchers. Our goal is to make technical writing and scientific research easily reproducible and shareable through beautiful typography and live coding tools.\n\nIn this talk I'll show how Phoenix channels, GenStage and Erlang ports elegantly solved the complex challenges of building a multi-language, browser-based live programming environment.\n\nElixirConf EU is a community conference created to promote education, networking and collaboration within the Elixir/Erlang/Ruby communities."
