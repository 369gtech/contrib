description: "Presented by Giles Bowkett at JSLA (js.la) on Thursday February 27th 2014 - WebGL stands for Web Graphics Library. A name so dull and generic may surprise you if you're used to hipster naming conventions, and could cover everything from generating GIFs (hard G for life) to the prepackaged icons you can find in Twitter Bootstrap. But immense power lurks behind this bland name. WebGL lets you put GPU graphics in a element, and it powers terrific games, infographics, and demoscene-style visuals. Giles Bowkett will blunder through this library, attempting to make it do things, and tell you all about it.\n\n* twitter.com/gilesgoatboy\n* github.com/gilesbowkett"
