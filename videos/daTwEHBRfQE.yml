description: "by Pavel Kruhlei\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/H.1308/e2e_tests_cypress.webm\n\n\nThe normal state of things with end-2-end testing is a pain: tests are flaky, slow, verbose and written by some QA guy.\nLet's see if I can convince you that it doesn't need to be like that, with an example of Cypress.io framework: a dev-centric open-source tool designed to make our life a little simple. \n\nRoom: H.1308 (Rolin)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 13:00:00+01"
