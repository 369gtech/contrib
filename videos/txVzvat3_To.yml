description: "Intro: Telepresence - Richard Li, Datawire \n\nWe'll talk about development workflows for Kubernetes. We'll discuss the differences between traditional development, and different approaches people take to building Kubernetes services. We'll then introduce Telepresence and discuss how it integrates with different organizational development workflows. Finally, we'll talk about the evolution of Telepresence and how we are actively moving Telepresence forward from its heritage as a VPN-type approach into a more sophisticated L7 routing layer for developers. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPie"
