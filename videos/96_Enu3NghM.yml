title: 'RISC-V Boot flow: What''s next ?'

description: "by Atish Patra\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/K.3.401/riscv_bootflow.webm\n\nRISC-V boot flow has come a long way since in recent times by leveraging the various opensource boot loaders/firmware projects. This also helped in achieving a well-supported and standard boot flow for RISC-V. As a result, developers can use the same boot loaders to boot Linux on RISC-V as they do in other architectures. Currently, U-Boot is used as the last stage boot loader and OpenSBI as the machine mode run time service provider, but there's more work to be done. A few of such future works includes U-boot SPL support, UEFI boot in RISC-V Linux and booting protocol improvements. This talk will focus on some of these ongoing works which are necessary to declare that RISC-V is truly ready for world domination.\n\nRoom: K.3.401\nScheduled start: 2020-02-01 12:10:00"
