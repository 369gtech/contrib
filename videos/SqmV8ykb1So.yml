description: "This event follows along the Internet of Things Event Learning Path. A learning path is a carefully curated set of technical sessions that provide a view into a particular area of Azure; and often help you prepare for a certification. Each session in a learning path is business-scenario focused so you can see how this technology could be used in the real world. Each session is independent, however viewing them as a series builds a clearer picture of when and how to use which technology.\n\nThe Internet of Things Event Learning Path is designed for Solution Architects, Business Decision Makers, and Development teams that are interested in building IoT Solutions with Azure Services. The content is comprised of 5 video-based modules that approach topics ranging from IoT device connectivity, IoT data communication strategies, use of artificial intelligence at the edge, data processing considerations for IoT data, and IoT solutioning based on the Azure IoT reference architecture. \n\nEach session includes a curated selection of associated modules from Microsoft Learn that can provide an interactive learning experience for the topics covered and may also contribute toward preparedness for the official AZ-220 IoT Developer Certification. \n\nThe video resources and presentation decks are open-source and can be found within the associated module's folder in this repository: https://github.com/microsoft/Internet-of-Things-Event-Learning-Path"
