Is it the end? No, it’s just a beginning. The life of your system just started. Just like a baby it will grow, evolve and wake you up in the middle of the night.\n\nUsually at this point you start thinking about fault tolerance and error handling. Fault-tolerance concepts sound simple: modern frameworks promise to effortlessly solve it for you. But what is hiding behind the simplicity? Is there anything else that may hurt you? Let’s take a peek, and find out how to design and build truly fault tolerant Java systems.\n\nLet’s make it real by trying failure scenarios against a live system, watching it recover in real-time - and then review the recipes (with gRPC and REST examples) that you can use right away to make YOUR code more resilient and YOUR system more robust.\n\nMykyta Protsenko From Netflix\nSoftware engineer passionate about all things scalable - from coding to deploying to monitoring.
