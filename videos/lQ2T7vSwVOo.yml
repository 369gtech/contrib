Well, a simulation of life at least but how will we keep our eyes on the process? What happens as our processes feed and reproduce? What genetic algorithms & instincts drive our population? What happens when we introduce a virus? Too soon? It's all apart of the evolutionary process as we watch our processes feed and reproduce right before us. This talk will cover Phoenix LiveView, genetic algorithms, and how we use OTP to tie it all together so come along and watch as this complex world unfolds live!\n\nRead the full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/johnny-winn/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - JOHNNY WINN\nHost of the Elixir Fountain\n\nThe renaissance man from Jacksonville, Johnny embarked on his computing curiosity during the eighties on a Commodore 64. However the road leading toward software craftsmanship has diverged down many paths. From musician to electrical engineer, chef to software developer, rugby player to local politician, the twist and turns have provided a wide range of experiences that have helped to shape him.\n\nMore on Johnny Winn: https://codesync.global/speaker/johnny-winn/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM SF 2020\nCode BEAM SF is powered by Code Sync.
