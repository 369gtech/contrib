description: "Upcoming JS Conference:\nJS Fest 2020 - 3-4th of April, Kiev, Ukraine\nDetails and tickets: http://bit.ly/364jtpv\n\nThe talk from JS Fest conference in Kyiv, Ukraine.\nPresentation: https://bit.ly/2YWmB4c\nFb: https://www.facebook.com/JSFestua/\nWebsite: http://jsfest.com.ua/\n\nThis talk will take a real-world look at what makes serverless so jazzy. Walking through the refactor of a Node Express app used internally at Mapbox, I'll share how we transformed a hard-to-maintain web app into a collection of independent AWS Lambda functions, and why: lower bills, better code, and happier teams. We'll cover when, why and how to take your architectural jazz to the next level and enjoy the artistic freedom of serverless functions - and listen to a little music along the way!"
