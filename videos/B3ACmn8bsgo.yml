description: "Case Study in Travel Business\n\nCheuk Ting Ho\n\nTuesday 18th, 12:00 (Ferrier Hall)\nA talk (25 minutes)\nFor time series analysis, everyone’s talking about ARIMA or Holt-Winters. But there’s other models which could also break down a seasonal series into trend, seasonality and noise. We will use an open source Python library called Seasonal to analyse B2B worldwide travel data.\n\nThe speaker suggested this session is suitable for data scientists."
