description: "Theo Schlossnagle and Heinrich Hartmann, Circonus\n\nThe Circonus platform is a telemetry (time-series) ingest, storage, and analysis platform that provides engineers with tooling to manage systems via SLOs. As SREs, we use SLOs to manage Circonus. Herein lie some interesting recursive lessons. This talk will detail the systems architecture from inception to current day including a migration from bare-metal to Google Cloud. Along this path have been many crimes against computing. I will talk specifically about the architectural evolution as punctuated by my failure.\n\nView the full SREcon18 Europe Program at: https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon18europe/program\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
