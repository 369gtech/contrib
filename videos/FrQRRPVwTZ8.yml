description: "Nintendo has a new console, and it's more secure than ever. The Switch was released less than a year ago, and we've been all over it.\n\nNintendo has designed a custom OS that is one of the most secure we've ever seen, making the game harder than it has ever been before. In this talk we will give an introduction to the unique software stack that powers the Switch, and share our progress in the challenge of breaking it. We will talk about the engineering that went into the console, and dive deep into the security concepts of the device.\n\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nThe original video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed)."
