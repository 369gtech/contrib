description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nGitopsify Cellular Architecture - Ayush Ghosh & Sergey Sergeev, Cisco Systems, Inc.\n\nBuilding and managing data-intensive microservices applications have their challenges. Cellular architecture & Gitops together help create an independently deployable, manageable, and observable solution. We moved from running multiple expensive non-prod inconsistent environments to testing in production. Weave Flux, Istio, and Crossplane helped us build multi-cloud, multi-cluster declarative environments in minutes.  With the new deployment model and custom tooling, devs can get a miniaturized version of the SaaS running on their laptops. The devs can pick and choose which components and versions they want to run locally.  The CI/CD metrics have improved dramatically as the integration & E2E tests run against real apps and not mocks. The system spins up real cloud-native solutions for production deployments and falls back to containerized workloads for non-production.  Adding support for new regions has come down to days of work from months."
