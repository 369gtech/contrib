Techniques like Ruby's new JIT compiler and deoptimization code help, but still are limited by techniques like monkey-patching and binding inspection.\n\nPre-evaluation is another optimization technique that works based on user-defined contracts and assumptions. Users can opt in to optimizations by limiting their use of Ruby's features and thereby allowing further compiler work.\n\nIn this talk we'll look at how pre-evaluation works, and what benefits it enables."
