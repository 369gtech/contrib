description: "The Common Data Model (CDM) is the standardized metadata definition language used by business and analytics applications to provide semantic consistency and facilitate data interoperability. CDM provides uniform data & semantics over a variety of areas. \r\nCDM brings the semantic consistency to Azure Data Lake with CDM folders allowing organizations to leverage AI and ML at a scale not previously achievable. Dataflows enable ingestion of data into Azure Data Lake Storage from a wide range of data sources, including the ability to transform data, enrich it and map it to CDM schemas.  We will provide deeper insight into the concepts & components of the CDM metadata system, as well as a step-by-step demo of landing data into ADLS using dataflows."
