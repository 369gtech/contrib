description: "Speaker(s):\nTimothy Jordan\n\nDescription:\nPeople no longer need to sit at a desk to get the benefits of technology. We can now build experiences that work seamlessly across different contexts. By removing abstract barriers, such as what functionality resides on what device, our users can focus more on what they're doing and less on how to start doing it. Join this session for an in-depth look at the platform components involved in building a single user experience across a phone, watch, TV, and car. We'll cover both the design philosophy and technical details while connecting all the pieces using the Google platform.\n\nWatch all Google I/O 2015 videos at: g.co/dev/io15videos.\n\n#io15"
