title: 'Exploring Text-Based Protocols - Joel Berger'
language: English
recordingDate: 1623175626
description: 'In modern tech we interact with many high-level applications but many people don''t know or haven''t explored the low-level protocols that these systems use for communication. Graphite, Memcached, Redis, IRC, HTTP and others use human readable communication ... if you only know where to look. Learning how these protocols work, and indeed how our software uses, interacts with, and even generates these low-level communications can help you better write better software and have a deeper understanding of how it works. In this talk I will introduce these and perhaps other protocols, show how to interact with them, and even build rudimentary clients for some.'
