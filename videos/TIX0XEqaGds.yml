title: 'Creating and testing REST contracts with Accurest Gradle Plugin  (Olga Maciaszek-Sharma)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1459618543
description: "REST does not come with an in-built contract compliance mechanism, which in many ways is a great thing. However, while working with microservice-based systems, it often appemars that a practical mechanism that would provide help in shaping and describing REST contracts would come in handy. Similarly, creating integration and acceptance tests in such systems presents many challenges.\n\nIn this talk, I will present Accurest, a Gradle plugin that allows for both: easily shaping REST contracts and verifying if our app adheres to them using automatically generated Spock tests. I will show how, using Accurest, we can quickly generate automatically-tested stubs from simple Groovy DSL scripts. I will talk about the typical usages and script examples, as well as possible problems and ways of handling them."
