description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2015.\nTrack: Core Spring\nSpeakers: Adam Koblentz and Josh Long\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/springboot-jrebel-cf\nAbstract: \nSpring Boot, the new convention-over-configuration centric framework from the Spring team at Pivotal, marries Spring's flexibility with conventional, common sense defaults to make application development not just fly, but pleasant! Spring Boot gives you a huge leg up over normal starter projects, now let's give you another boost by adding JRebel. With JRebel, the average Java developer saves over 1 work-month per year by using JRebel to skip rebuild, restart, and redeploys of their application. With Boot and JRebel, developers can get up and running and then stay focused on doing what's important: writing kick-ass applications. In this session, developers will learn about spring boot and how to go from nothing to a fully functioning app in no time, then see how they can keep the app up and reload code changes instantly without redeploying and stay in the flow.\nSeptember 16, 2015\n10:30 - 12:00\nSalon A-D\nAdam Koblentz\nJosh Long (龙之春)"
