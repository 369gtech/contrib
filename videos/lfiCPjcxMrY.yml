Meanwhile OpenMandrivia already builds most of its package with the LLVM toolchain, the Debian archive is regularly rebuilt with with a recent verion of clang... So could we try that for Fedora?\n\n\nThis talk describes an on-going effort to achieve that goal while keeping the same compiler feature set as GCC.\nSubtopics of the talk include:\n\n\n❮ul❯\n❮li❯Creating a clang-based buildroot and use it to rebuild the fedora user-land (and more?)❮/li❯\n❮li❯Support for missing security features such as -fstack-clash-protection or -D❮em❯FORTIFY❮/em❯SOURCE=2❮/li❯\n❮li❯Add missing features for the annobin tool within lld❮/li❯\n❮li❯Python3 compatibity❮/li❯\n❮li❯Package size❮/li❯\n❮/ul❯\n\n\nRoom: K.4.201\nScheduled start: 2020-02-01 11:10:00"
