description: 'Have you ever wanted to refactor mercilessly but didn''t want to break the fragile tower? Or have you ever pushed to production only to spend the next few days cleaning up the regressions? You need integration tests, and Cypress is a great, fast way to build them. With a simple JavaScript or TypeScript interface, you can automate browsers to hit those critical functions in your app to prove it works as expected -- this time and every time. Join us to dive into building Cypress tests and leave with confidence to refactor your way to greatness.'
