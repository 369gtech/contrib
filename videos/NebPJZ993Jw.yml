description: "Sandi Metz argues that you need abstraction when your requirements are vague. I've previously been saying that abstraction *always* is pragmatism, but I'll gladly admit that I now believe more in Metz's postulation.  Abstraction is appropriate only when your requirements are not 100% clear. In some sense this is just another way of saying that if you are expected change.. you should introduce abstraction.\n\n\nPREVIOUS VIDEOS ON ABSTRACTION\n\nPremature abstraction is not premature\nhttps://youtu.be/SWnIikyd32E\n\nAbstraction is pragmatism\nhttps://youtu.be/Sno_JiHMF_8\n\n\nOTHER VIDEOS MENTIONED\n\nSandi Metz on defining Object-Oriented Design\nhttps://youtu.be/HGT8bKSS6XQ?t=15m55s\n\n\nGEAR USED\n\n?
