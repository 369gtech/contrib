description: "Having diverted her career from a programmer to an architect, Susanna had been exploring ways to utilize scripting as a design process to generate complex facade designs for architecture throughout her time as an architect in London and Tokyo. This talk walks through several major projects that Susanna worked on, such as the V&A museum in Dundee and several other major architectural projects, explaining the design process behind them and how she used the Rhinoscript scripting tools to solve design problems.\n\nMore details here: http://www.codemesh.io/codemesh2017/susanna-wong"
