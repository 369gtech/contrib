description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nCluster performance impacts not only the performance of your workloads, but the bottom line of your business as a whole. Inefficient Kubernetes cluster performance can quickly lead to resource wastage, poor utilization, and higher cloud costs.\n\nThis session will take a comprehensive look at Kubernetes cluster performance considerations and resource management best practices. We will walk through core concepts such as resource pressure, pod eviction, OOM and cgroups, and demonstrate how the Kubernetes scheduler behaves as a result. Learn how to identify the metrics that are most important for understanding cluster performance and the queries you should use to monitor these metrics with Prometheus and Grafana. Weâ€™ll visualize these performance metrics using a pre-built Grafana dashboard as individual graphs, and explore the ways in which these metrics affect not just workload performance but the overall impact to cluster cost of ownership."
