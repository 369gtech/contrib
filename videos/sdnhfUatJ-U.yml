title: 'Helping Caterpillars Fly'
recordingDate: 1484803440
description: "Nicola Nye\nhttp://linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/135/\nYou need documentation.\r\n\r\nNo really, you **NEED** documentation. The health, longevity and success of all your favourite FOSS depends on it.\r\n\r\nThis talk examines the Very Hungry Caterpillar lifecycle of a FOSS project. From the early beginnings as a small egg of an idea, into a hungry caterpillar. And then it reflects on why some projects turn into beautiful butterflies and why some never make it past the stage of the cocoon.\r\n\r\nGiven we would all rather be surrounded by beautiful butterflies, rather than voracious slugs, I propose that the best way for your favourite FOSS project to grow wings is through documentation contributions and not code.\r\n\r\nThrough my experience on the Cyrus mail server, I'll then go through some practical ways that technical writers, developers and even users can help a project fly. And provide some danger signs on what documentation is actively counterproductive.\r\n\r\nWe'll look at processes, _cheese_, templates, _pickles_, tools, _ice cream_, communication, _cake_, style guides and _butterflies_."
