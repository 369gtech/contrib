description: "Recording brought to you by American Express https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs\nGraphics programming is a field dominated by traditional languages like C and C++, or specialized languages like GLSL and HLSL. In this talk, we go over how Kotlin allows you to take advantage of a managed language while preserving the conciseness and expressiveness of low-level languages like C++ when writing math and graphics oriented code.\n\nAbout the Presenter:\nRomain Guy is an engineer at Google. He worked on the Android Framework team, leading the UI toolkit and UI renderer, and now works on new graphics related projects."
