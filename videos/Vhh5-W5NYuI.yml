description: "According to Forester Research, \"more than half of enterprises that aren't already using Agile processes are interested in adopting them\".\r\nWhy should we change? Traditional waterfall process has been the way software was developed in enterprise for years. With great success. What business benefits \"individuals and interactions over processes and tools\" (from Agile manifesto) provide?\r\nWe're making a statement that there are ways to adopt and adapt specific Agile practices in organization those work in conjunction with other non-agile practices. The goal of this discussion is to dispel the myth that the two are mutually exclusive and cannot work together. Development techniques and tools have to be adjusted in order for Agile practices to work. Agile methods need to be adapted to the context of the enterprise as well. Let's not stick to particular Agile methodology but instead discuss which Agile practices can be adopted in enterprises and what value they provide."
