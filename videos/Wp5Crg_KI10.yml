description: "Google Tech Talk\r\nWeb Exponents\r\nAugust 13, 2009\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nPresented by Aza Raskin.\r\n\r\nJetpack is an exploration in using Web technologies to enhance the browser (e.g. HTML, CSS and Javascript), with the goal of allowing anyone who can build a Web site to participate in making the Web a better place to work, communicate and play.\r\n\r\nAza Raskin is currently the Head of User Experience for Mozilla Labs, where he works on crafting the future of the web. He's led projects ranging from semantic language-based interfaces (Ubiquity), to redesigning the Firefox extension platform (JetPack). Aza gave his first talk on user interface at age 10 and got hooked. At 17, he was talking and consulting internationally; at 19, he coauthored a physics textbook because he was too young to buy alcohol; at 21, he started drinking alcohol and co-founded Humanized. Two years later, Aza founded Songza.com, a minimalist music search engine that had over a million song plays during it's first week of operation. In another life, Aza has done Dark Matter research at both Tokyo University and the University of Chicago, from where he graduated with degrees in math and physics.\r\n\r\nThe Web Exponents Series is hosted by Steve Souders"
