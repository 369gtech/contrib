description: "(Comedy/satire talk) Never in the history of humankind or geekkind have we had such an opportunity for achieving software quality greatness. The existing of data, metrics, more data, and more metrics means that we can finally analyze the numbers and derive the final answer to the question all programmers have wondered since the beginning of time (1 January 1970 00:00:00): How can we create programs without bugs?\n\nCome to this presentation to hear the answer, and a few more answers to a few more questions along the way.\n\nChet is the Chief Advocate for Android at Google. He joined the Android team in 2010, led the Toolkit team for several years, and now spends his time helping developers to create better Android applications.\n\nRomain is the lead of the Android Toolkit team at Google, responsible for the UI Toolkit, Android Jetpack libraries, Jetpack Compose, Filament, etc.Romain has worked on Android since before 1.0 and is passionate about anything graphics or UI related."
