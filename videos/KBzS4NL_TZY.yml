description: "Wednesday, February 25, 2015 - 16:00 to 17:00\n\nData centre servers utilization average between 6 to 12% -- the most efficient utilization barely touches 35% (at Google).  When faced with a computing problem, companies just put up more servers to cater to the workload, instead of running the machines the company already has at higher utilization. This short-term solution results in ever-increasing energy consumption and escalating costs of operations. How to tackle this tremendous waste of resources?\n\nSardina Systems could raise utilisation from 15% -- 45%, in a 55,000 server data center with 16% workload growth, saving $10 million in energy OpEx annually and $600 million in CapEx over 4 years. Their solution is FishDirector -- the world's first energy-optimizing and utilization improving OpenStack management and automation system. FishDirector supports the OpenStack platform and has been selected as the solution for managing a record data center with up to 150,000 VMs (in production).  It provides the resource management and pluggable architecture for enabling a wide variety of automation and data access methods, in a scalable, fault-tolerant manner for data centers, improving data center utilization and lowering costs.\n\nJoin Dr. Kenneth Tan, Technical Solutions Director of Sardina Systems, for an insightful discussion about the challenges of optimizing server utilization.\n\nIn this webinar, you will learn:\n\n    About utilization issues and possible solutions\n    What is FishDirector and how does its architecture work\n    Use Cases and Test Cases for FishDirector"
