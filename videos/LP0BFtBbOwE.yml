description: "Panel Discussion: Democratizing HPC & AI: Startups Scale Up with Cloud Native - Emily Tanaka-Delgado, Oracle; Charlie Davies, iGeolise; Priya Shah, Sauce; Ant Kennedy, Gapsquare; and Alfonso Santiago, ELEM \n\nInnovativeness, resourcefulness, and responsiveness are all part of the startup DNA, and with the aid of the cloud native era and ecosystem, they are unstoppable. Hear how these European startups are leveraging technologies such as Kubernetes, containers, GPUs, Singularity and more to gain efficiencies across architecture, time, and team to reach global scale, reshape user interactions, and even, save lives.  In this panel, startups from Barcelona and the UK will discuss how cloud native technologies have helped unlock access to unlimited potential across such diverse case studies as identifying and fixing gender pay gap issues, creating computational models of virtual patients, reinventing cloud-based video collaboration, and interpreting travel and navigation based on time, all to transform their businesses to match behavioral patterns within their industries. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPY0"
