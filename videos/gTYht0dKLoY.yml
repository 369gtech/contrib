title: 'Production ready Kubernetes in OpenStack public clouds'
recordingDate: 1548401595
description: "Feilong Wang, Xingchao Yu\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/174/\n\nPlatform services have came a long way. Not only they are getting more popular, but they are also driving true multi-cloud interoperability. The combination of OpenStack and Kubernetes is becoming a standard option to allow users to benefit from both virtual machines and containers for their cloud-native applications.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this presentation we will share Catalystâ€™s public cloud journey in building a production ready managed Kubernetes service on top of OpenStack. The following items will be covered:\r\n\r\n* Network isolation with K8s network policy\r\n* Persistent volume integrated with OpenStack Cinder\r\n* Loadbalancer and Ingress integrated with Octavia\r\n* K8s Keystone auth integration\r\n* Multi master deployment\r\n* Conformance (Sonobuoy) verification/testing\r\n* Automation of K8s rolling upgrades\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
