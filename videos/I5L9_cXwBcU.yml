Both are blistering fast, and incredibly easy to use. Building multiplayer games has never been easier.\n\nTalk objectives\n\nThis talk will take you on a step by step guide building yourself a game template, and then using that template to create several multiplayer games. We will introduce you to the joy of creating games using these two wonderful frameworks, and demonstrate some of the possibilities, as well as highlighting some of the challenges and common pitfalls to avoid when developing multiplayer games.\n\nTarget audience\n\nBeginners and anyone interested in having fun with Phoenix channels.\n\n\nKeith is a programmer, sailor and kitesurfer in any order.
