description: "At some point in 2010 the balance tipped over: the majority of the world's online information is now non-English unstructured data. This talk will explore how space and direction are expressed differently in some of the 5,000 languages in the connected world; how this can influence people's perception of space (English-speakers included); and the implications for location-based technology and services. Linguistic diversity is highly concentrated with our greatest assets, including ecological diversity and mineral wealth, but also with our greatest threats, including sudden onset crises and epidemics. I will draw on examples from work in these four areas.\n\nRobert Munro\n\nIdibon\n\nBig data for a better world! Rob is the CEO of Idibon, who are tackling the problem of extracting information from unstructured speech and text in the world's connected languagesâ€”all 5000 of them. His background includes building infrastructure in Sierra Leone and Liberia, running crowdsourced translation platforms for Haiti, and work in language processing technologies that support a number of Silicon Valley search-engines and start-ups. He has a PhD from Stanford University."
