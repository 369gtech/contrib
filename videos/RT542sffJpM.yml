How do you overcome the silos, the legacy, and the entrenched behaviors that are making your DevOps problems seem so intractable?\n\nThis talk is about how to start and sustain a DevOps transformations in large and complex organizations using a methodical — and totally reasonable — Kaizen (Continuous Improvement) approach.
