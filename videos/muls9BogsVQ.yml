description: "Congratulations! You’re the technical lead on your next project! But now what? The lead can be responsible for requirements, architecture, communication with clients or managers, or divvying work amongst the team–and that's just what they tell you about ahead of time. We’ll talk about how to oversee the project without losing sight of the day to day, how to motivate your team without overstepping your bounds, and tactics to deal with issues you might not anticipate, but will almost certainly encounter.\n\nEVENT:\n\nPolyConf 2017\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nEryn O'Neil\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nPolyConf Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nPolyConf: https://polyconf.com/"
