description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Amsterdam 2019. #GOTOcon #GOTOams\nhttp://gotoams.nl\n\nLieven Vandersypen - Professor of Quantum Nanoscience & co-director of the Kavli Institute of Nanoscience at TU Delft & co-founder of QuTech\n\nABSTRACT\nQuantum computers could tackle problems in materials science, chemistry and mathematics that are well beyond the reach of supercomputers. This remarkable promise derives from the use of quantum bits, which can exist in arbitrary combinations of 0 and 1.\nThis leads to a computing power that doubles with every additional quantum bit. The challenge is that quantum bits are extremely fragile and their state is easily perturbed by environmental fluctuations. Recent theoretical and experimental advances have made it clear that the resulting errors can in principle be corrected. What it takes is a system containing thousands or millions of quantum bits operating at ultra-low temperatures, that must be programmed and controlled via classical mixed-signal and microwave circuits.\nThis talk will introduce the basic concepts behind quantum computing, summarize the state-of-the-art of solid-state implementations of quantum circuits, and present [...]\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotoams.nl/2019/sessions/776\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOamst\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttp://gotocon.com\n#QuantumComputing #QuantumComputers #QuantumProgramming #QuantumBits"
