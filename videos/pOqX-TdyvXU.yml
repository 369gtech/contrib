description: "It's 2018 and websites are increasingly becoming the primary way to access services. Brilliant! But what about the impact of inaccessible sites on users? \nIn this talk, we'll go through practical steps to consider accessibility when building products - whether you're the sole dev on a project or part of a larger organisation. I'll share my experience at BBC News, as an accessibility champion: how we carry out accessibility research, reviews & tests.\n\nSareh is a web developer at BBC News, in London. She's interested in web accessibility, performance and all the various things that improve a user's experience of interacting with websites.\n\n\nJSConf.Asia - Capitol Theatre, Singapore - 27 January 2018\n\nSource: https://2018.jsconf.asia/\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
