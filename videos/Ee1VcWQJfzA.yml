description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2013\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nRuss Miles - Co-Author of Head First Software Development\n\nABSTRACT\nRich Hickey has stated \"The simpler solution is going to kick your butt\", Russ Miles would go further, \"The simpler solution is already kicking your butt; no one is more agile than the teams developing with simplicity in mind\".\n\nBut what makes a complex solution and why is its complexity such a confining force on your ability to be agile and respond to market needs? In this talk Russ Miles, principal consultant at Simplicity Itself, will share the hard lessons learned while designing a real world application that, through applying practical simplicity techniques to its architecture and design, managed to harness and then maintain the real benefits of agility, saving a company from over-producing, wasting millions of pounds and, more importantly, months of people's lives! \n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
