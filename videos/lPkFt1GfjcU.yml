title: 'Breaking down the monolith - Vincent Nikkelen'
recordingDate: 1505130311
description: "So your current monolith is not maintainable anymore and starts falling apart? Your effort to keep things running increases and your productivity drops? You're secretly ashamed of what you thought was a great design 10 years ago? Congratulations, this is not a failure from your side, nor from your organization. This is one of the key indicators for success !! \n\nBut now you are facing the enormous task to break down this monolith. You've read many books about microservices and they all describe how to build a website, but none of that fits your current system nor do they help you in changing your organization and helping you to develop a technical strategy. \n\nIn this short presentation, I'll touch upon the 3 most important aspects of breaking down the monolith: \n\n- Don't forget why you are doing it \n\n- Dare to make mistakes \n\n- Focus on the Service Domain, break down the data domain later \n\nYou'll discover that there is a tight coupling between those 3 items, that breaking down the monolith is not only a technical challenge but that it will challenge you on other levels as well. The presented viewpoint will be from a developer/engineer standpoint. \n\nAfter studying Parallel Computing in Eindhoven and Budapest, Vincent worked for Ericsson in Hungary where he held key architectural positions within development for MSC (Mobility Management), AXD-301 and TSP-Dicos; a scalable high-availability platform with a distributed database. In 2008, he moved with his family to Sweden where he lead projects developing new platforms for Ericsson Mobile Platforms. He currently works for Verisure Securitas Direct, the largest alarm operator in Europe. He is one of the driving forces in the activities to break down their monolith into microservices.\n__________________________\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry in the Malmö/Lund region.
