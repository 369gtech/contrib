description: "Bean Validation 2.0 is out and the theme is Java 8. That’s a good thing since Java 8 brings not only new types to validate but also new locations to put annotations on.\n\nWe took that round to add useful things like:\n\n* @Repeatable on constraints\n\n* collection elements validation \n\n* Java 8 date / time\n\n* Optional  @URL String \n\nIn 15 mins, you will see what are the main features of Bean Validation 2.0.\n\nGunnar Morling is a software engineer and open-source enthusiast by heart. He’s leading the Debezium project, a tool for change data capture (CDC). As part of the Hibernate team, he contributes to Hibernate Search, OGM and Validator. Gunnar is the spec lead for Bean Validation 2.0 (JSR 380). In his spare time he leads the MapStruct project. Prior to joining Red Hat, he worked on a wide range of Java EE projects in the logistics and retail industries. He’s based in Hamburg, Germany."
