description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nProduction CI/CD with CNBs: Tekton and Gitlab and CircleCI (plus), Oh My! - David Freilich & Natalie Arellano, VMware \n\nYou may have heard of Cloud Native Buildpacks (https://buildpacks.io/), a set of tools for transforming application source code to OCI images that can run on any cloud. In this session, we’ll delve into some new functionality of Cloud Native Buildpacks which can be powerful in the enterprise context, such as the ability to narrowly define trusted builders, allowing developers and operators to restrict access to registry credentials, as well as the ability to create Windows images. We’ll spend the core of our time exploring how you can use Cloud Native Buildpacks in a number of CI/CD systems, including Tekton, Gitlab and CircleCI. By the end of this session, you’ll come out with a better understanding of the capabilities of the Cloud Native Buildpacks project, and how to integrate it into your production CI/CD system. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ekAy"
