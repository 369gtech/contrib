description: "Keynote: Customer Value is More than Just Technical Solutions –\_Chisara Nwabara, Staff Technical Program Manager, Pivotal\n\nA customer-facing team was feeling pain around communication with Pivotal R&D and we realized that this may not be a software problem but instead a communication problem. Software usually solves problems, but sometimes solutions could be as simple as changing people’s mindset. This adjustment can impact greatly and result in a significantly positive outcome. You may already have what you need to make a huge impact and cultural transformation is a critical element for digital transformation. Everyone's ultimate goal is to ensure that Pivotal provides recognizable value to customers through a positive customer experience.\nIn this keynote, Chisa will discuss some of the approaches Pivotal is taking to improve communication and build empathy between their R&D and customer-facing teams in order to deliver a better experience and value.\n\nhttps://cfseu18.sched.com/event/FW1a/keynote-customer-value-is-more-than-just-technical-solutions-chisara-nwabara-staff-technical-program-manager-pivotal"
