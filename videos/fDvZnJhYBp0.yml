The abbey is an 8-bit game (for spectrum and CPC) that became the first RPG game in 3D (2.5D) in 1987. The solution of the game is so hard (5**1000) that we don't know any human that passed it without help.\n\nThe challenge is design an AI that play and solve the game. We used Reinforcement Learning as the main Deep Learning.\n\nBuilding a project like this take a lots of big challenges like: lots of resources for training the model (GPUs/TPUs), executing games , storing lots of information, analyzing data, etc.\n\nWhen you need to afford it, you will need a lot of products/tools no just AI tools like tensorflow/keras. We will show you how Google Cloud is your perfect ally and you will have the right tools to leverage a near impossible problem like this one.\n\nJuantomas Garcia \nFrom S|ngular\nChief Envisioner Evangelist Google Developer Expert for Cloud/Machine Learning Author the Spanish free software book \"La Pastilla Roja\" Organizer of Machine Learning Spain and GDG cloud Madrid meetups. Former President of Hispalinux (Spanish Linux Local User Group)\n\nSebastián Jesús Blanes López\n16+ years of experience, 7+ as project manager, in a multinational IT company, working in bank, industry and telecommunications sectors.\n\nCurrently I’m fully focused on API Management and the API Economy generated around it.\n\nIn my spare time I maintain VigasocoSDL , a fork of Vigasoco (A complete disassembly of the original Z80 code for the Amstrad CPC of the classic computer video game \"La abadía del crimen) and a rewrite of it in C++ made by Manuel Abadia) using SDL to port and run the game in every system with SDL libs and a modern c++ compiler. Right now, there are versions for PlayStation2, DreamCast, Linux, Mac and Windows :-)"
