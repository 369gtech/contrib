title: 'Video Transcoding at Scale for ABC iview - Daphne Chong'
recordingDate: 1474270362
description: "ABC iview streams thousands of TV programs to millions of Australians every year. It is one of the most popular video streaming platforms in the country and covers a wide range of devices including phones, tablets and TVs, and a huge range of content.\nThis talk will explore the technical challenges of transcoding ABC iview's video content at scale. How do we standardise each video? What's the process that each video goes through? How did we design a system to scale responsively, but with very low cost? We will deeply examine the architecture and design of the ABC's new system, which heavily relies on AWS services, FFmpeg, and components we've written in Node.js and Golang.\n\nCome along to learn what our successes have been, and meet the new, flexible, scalable, and hugely cost-efficient system driving the ABC's video future."
