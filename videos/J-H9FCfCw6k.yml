recordingDate: 1506519865
description: "Every community needs diversity. Drupal is no exception. But you have heard about the gender gap in tech, haven’t you? The facts speak for themselves: only 20% of the visitors at DrupalCon Dublin 2016 were women; roughly half of them are programmers and developers. Indeed, the gender gap in technology has been getting worse since the 1980s. No wonder it is such a hot topic now.\n\n\nThe questions that arise are:\n\nHow big is the gender gap?\nWhy is it crucial to close it?\nWhat can we do to fix it?\nIn our session we will not only tackle these problems but also suggest a way out of them. The aim of the talk is to provide the tools and to outline the roadmap of how tech communities, and the Drupal one in particular, can encourage women to start their careers in technology and become role models for future generations.\n\n\nWhat’s in it for you? Allow us to...\n\nIdentify the problem of the gender gap in tech and illustrate the related numbers;\n\nPresent the results of our “Coding Girls” video survey.\n\nIntroduce role models from tech communities to empower girls and women;\n\nShare a personal story by a passionate Drupal developer, Maria Totova.\n\nProvide a guideline on how we can close the gender gap in technology and build the foundations of trust, respect and support with the help of Coding Girls.\n\nIt is important to underline that our session is not only for women - it is for everyone who is willing to create a more attractive and fun workplace for all of us. We would love to hear your point of view, ideas and suggestions as well! Let’s break the status quo together and build an empowering and inclusive community for everybody.\n\nClosing the gender gap…Are you ready?\n\n\nAbout the speakers:\_\n\n\n\n\nAnna Radulovski\_is an activist and advocate for gender equality in the tech world.
