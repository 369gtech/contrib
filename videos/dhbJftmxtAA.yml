description: "Hear a case study that examines two JavaFX applications developed for two different customers in Spain but with common ground: both are front-end applications for a Java application server connected to an industrial programmable logic controller (PLC) for automation of processes, among other services. This session shows you how to successfully deploy an end-to-end Java application, describing the main aspects of the server and its connections to the front end and then providing an in-depth analysis of the JavaFX-based UI. Special consideration is given to tuning for optimal performance as demonstrated by real tests on the ground. The session concludes with a live demo of both applications, including the use of a JavaFX custom control developed specifically for one of the apps.\n\n\nAuthor:\nJosé Pereda\nJosé Pereda is a Structural Engineer working in the School of Engineers in the University of Valladolid in Spain for more than 15 years, and his passion is related to applying programming to solve real problems.
