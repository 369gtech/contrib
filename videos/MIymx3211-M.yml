description: "Every brand wants to engage their audience, but far too many fail by overcomplicating the work. They aim for a viral video that feels “authentic” yet speak in a pre-calculated voice. They strive to make simple, compelling content but have a media buy so monstrous that unnecessary polish can’t be avoided.  In this talk, former ad agency art director turned interactive artist & filmmaker Ivan Cash shares his work creating unique, viral projects, and goes on to show why great ideas surpass big budget, why real is always better than “perfect,” and how taking risks, breaking rules, and simply viewing every project as an experiment can lead to profound creative transformation.\n\nIvan Cash\nFounder, Cash Studios\nhttps://twitter.com/shwizle\nhttps://facebook.com/cashstudios\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
