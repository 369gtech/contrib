Google Cloud is designed to deal with those challenges. Today, nine Google Cloud products have one billion users each. But, it’s not just for Google’s challenge anymore, Google Cloud helps companies and users find their own solutions by leveraging Google’s technology, infrastructure, operations, and expertise.
