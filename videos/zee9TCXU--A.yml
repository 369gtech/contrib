title: 'YOW! 2012 Marko A. Rodriguez - Applying Graphs to Solve Real World Problems'
recordingDate: 1513951280
description: "Graphs are a fundamental data structure much loved in the scientific domains of graph theory and network science. In recent years, there has been a surge of interest from developers in applying such techniques to solve real-world business problems. Drawing upon experiences with Fortune 50 organisations and time spent producing graph database technology, this presentation will discuss the developer-focused graph tools and demonstrate the types of problems that can be solved with graphs and the technologies that are currently being used to solve such problems.\n\nDr. Marko A. Rodriguez has focused his academic and commercial career on graph theory, network science, and graph-system architecture and development. Marko is an active contributor to the open source, graph stack TinkerPop, where he is the primary developer of the graph traversal language Gremlin. Previously, he received his Bachelors in Cognitive Science, his Masters and Ph.D. in Computer Science and was a Director's Fellow at the Center for Nonlinear Studies of the Los Alamos National Laboratory. He currently lives in Santa Fe, New Mexico where he serves as the CEO of the graph computing company Aurelius. Software Passion: Developing uniquely expressive ways to manipulate data.
