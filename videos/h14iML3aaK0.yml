recordingDate: 1504535651
description: 'All popular NoSQL solutions are popular because they are well promoted. And this is a reason why many people use them without deep understanding of what it exactly is and if it satisfies their business requirements. During this talk Andriy will describe what Apache Cassandra is and how it actually processes your requests. This might make you think about if Cassandra is the right solution for your business cases, scenarios and queries or not.'
