description: "Because speaking at conferences can be difficult and/or scary, we have prepared an office hours for anyone thinking about submitting to speak at ng-conf 2020. The organizers of the conference will be live online, and each person watching can ask their questions about the Call for Papers and speaker selection process. We want to give you ideas about what you can expect through out the entire CFP process. Additionally, we want to provide a place where people can ask their questions about the CFP.\n\nIn years past, we have seen quite a few people come to this event and walk away with enough knowledge that their talk ends up getting selected. We hope that this year will be the same. So prepare your questions and prepare your ideas, and come be a part of this event. \n\nFollow us on twitter https://twitter.com/ngconf\nOfficial Website: https://www.ng-conf.org/"
