description: "Bdale Garbee\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/142/\n\nIn the beginning, the motivation for developing and using Free Software centered on a shared value of enabling and maintaining end user freedom.  As more and more developers joined Free and Open Source Software communities and software innovation moved largely to openly collaborative spaces, the economic benefits for companies of using FOSS technology became immense.  Not surprisingly, this has led us to an era where we talk more about benefits than core FOSS values, which unfortunately can lead us to make choices that aren't good long-term bets!\r\n\r\nThe immense growth and success of FOSS has led to a world in which virtually every computing device on the planet contains at least some open source component.  But even today, many companies fear deeply engaging in the collaborative development model, insisting instead on licences and governance terms for the FOSS projects they interact with that allow them to be pure consumers of innovation.\r\n\r\nThis talk will review the economics of collaboration, and the related essentials of FOSS project longevity, illuminating the difference between consumptive and fully engaged participation.  The session will conclude with concrete suggestions on how to maximize the value of participation in FOSS for users, developers, and corporate decision makers... and why the best bet may be to go all-in!\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
