description: "Little Printing for everyone!!1 by Tamás Kádár\n\nDo you remember the Little Printer? It was an internet-connected, super cute thermal printer, which printed you your calendar and news headlines in the morning; you could even message your friends if they also had one. It was a commercial flop and the servers were shut down in 2015, but that’s only the start of our story. Today, with a little work, you too have your own Little Printer — and now you can use any thermal printer for it (some assembly required).\n\nTamás is a generalist working in DevOps and Infrastructure lately, automating all the things. He’s really into writing lately and loves the world’s most pointless drink, a decaf iced latte."
