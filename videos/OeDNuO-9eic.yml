description: "(Recorded at Jfokus 2016. http://www.jfokus.com)\n\nMicroservices for Mortals\n\nMicroservices is the new popular kid on the block. Crowd pleaser at many conferences. With popular poster children such as Netflix and Amazon it seems to be the killer approach to 21st century architectures, right? But is this stuff only for Hollywood Coders pioneering on the bleeding edge of our profession? Or is this stuff ready to be used for your projects and your customers? This presentation is a warning. Microservices don't fix broken organizations and distributed computing is still hard. I will go over the benefits, but more so the pitfalls, of using a Microservices based architecture. What impact does it have on your applications, on dealing with scale and failures, and how do you prevent your systems landscape from becoming an unmaintainable nightmare.\n\nBert Ertman, Luminis\n\nBert Ertman is a Fellow at Luminis in the Netherlands.
