description: "MobileOptimized 2019\nAndroid track\n\nYou will be hacked. What to do about it? - Maurice Gavin @Toothpic\nIndustry's focus on \"Big Data\" for the past few years has resulted in companies storing huge quantities of user data on their systems. The reward for attackers, financial or otherwise, has never been higher. Android apps are disproportionally more likely to be used as an attack vector than their iOS counterparts. In this talk, you will be introduced into useful tools and libraries for hardening our Android apps. You will look at ways to verify the trustworthiness of devices, the best practices for storing secrets and more. You'll also touch on incident response to security events and how to prepare yourself and your company for such an eventuality.\nIn this current climate of heightened user awareness you need to demonstrate that you can protect the users of our products, after this session you will be better able to do just that.\n\nGeneral Partner –Apalon (https://www.apalon.com/)\nVideo Partner – Flo (https://flo.health/)"
