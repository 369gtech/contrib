Why, Datomic, of course!\n\nIn this talk we explore the interesting interplay between process and reality, between representation and signification, between mere data and actionable knowledge, from a distinctly Datomic-centric point of view.\n\nIt turns out Datomic metaphysics is deep and the better you understand it, and really grok that everything, even schema, is data, the more real-world and robust your solutions will be.
