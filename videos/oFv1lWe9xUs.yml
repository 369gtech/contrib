title: 'Headless CMS - Build Apps, Not Content | Erik Slack | ng-conf 2021'
language: English
recordingDate: 1635356701
description: "The main draw of a headless cms is that it lets authorized users customize content without having any knowledge of how to code. If someone knows how to use a text editor, then they should be able to make new content using the cms. It doesn't matter what stack you're using, a headless cms can enable non-developers to write the content, freeing developers up to build cool applications.\n\nng-conf is a multi-day Angular conference focused on delivering the highest quality training in the Angular JavaScript framework. 1000's of developers from across the globe join together to attend talks and workshops by the Angular team and other community experts.\n\nFollow us on twitter https://twitter.com/ngconfâ€‹ \nOfficial Website: https://www.ng-conf.org/"
