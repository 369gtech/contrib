description: "by Miklos Vajna\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/UA2.114/improving_smartart_import_in_libreoffice_impress.webm\n\n\nLibreOffice Impress was capable of importing your SmartArt graphics from PPTX files for a long time. Today this is a popular feature, and we only do a good job of rendering this shape type when the file has a fallback rendering included. LibreOffice 6.3 will contain a long series of small, incremental improvements in this area, resulting in a large step forward when it comes to laying out SmartArt document models. This will be a major improvement for documents which don't have a pre-rendered layout included. The result affects both desktop LibreOffice and the Online.  Come and see how this work is implemented, where are the still rough edges and how you can help. \n\nRoom: UA2.114 (Baudoux)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 16:00:00+01"
