description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2015\nSpeakers: Mark Fisher & Patrick Peralta\nBig Data Track\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/cloud-native-data-flow-orchestration\n\nThe Spring Cloud Stream and Spring Cloud Task projects provide a simple and powerful framework for creating cloud native data microservices for stream and batch processing. Each microservice in these distributed systems consists of a stand-alone Spring Boot application.\n\nWhile it is possible to define data pipelines across these microservice apps manually, Spring Cloud Data Flow is an integrated orchestration layer that provides a highly productive deployment and management experience for development and ops. Streams and tasks are defined using the same DSL and shell/UI introduced with Spring XD. Furthermore, a pluggable runtime SPI allows Spring Cloud Data Flow to coordinate these applications across a variety of distributed runtime platforms including Apache YARN, Lattice, and Cloud Foundry.\n\nThis session will provide an overview of the Spring Cloud Data Flow architecture â€“ including how it evolved out of Spring XD. Additionally, a streaming application will be deployed on each of the supported runtimes in a live demo."
