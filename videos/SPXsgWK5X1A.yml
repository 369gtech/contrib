description: "Class & Sequence Diagrams Here: http://goo.gl/uZ3xG\n\nIn previous tutorials I showed you how to make a sequence diagram. In this video, I'll show you how to convert a Sequence Diagram into a Class Diagram. You should watch the tutorials on making sequence diagrams if you missed them.\n\nIn this tutorial, I wanted to show step-by-step how sequence diagrams are turned into class diagrams. Then in the next video, I'll turn them both into working code in about 10 minutes."
