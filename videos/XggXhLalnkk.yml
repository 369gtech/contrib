description: "Speaker: Weiqing Toh, Software Engineer, Ministry of Education\n\nThe construct of the Ruby language allows for meta-programming, or 'code which modifies code at runtime'. However, meta-programming is a double-edged sword; as much as it is useful, it could very easily be misused by teams as well. In this talk, I will cover the benefits of meta-programming and some (basic) fundamentals (in the context of Ruby on Rails) and discuss pitfalls, anti-patterns, and considerations by teams before adopting meta-programming. Don't worry, this is easily digestible for rubyists of all levels!\n\nSpeaker's Bio\n\nWeiqing is a software engineer at Experimental Systems and Technology Lab, an engineering team from Singapore's Ministry of Education. He works on prototyping and building apps to help Singapore schools be better at what they do. In his spare time, he enjoys doing yoga and getting a good dose of overseas hikes.\n\nEvent Page: http://www.reddotrubyconf.com/\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/8HYS/"
