description: "Further information: https://berlinbuzzwords.de/users/karen-sandler\n\nViewed in a broader social construct, is free software a movement or should it be?

Karen analyses the role of free software and questions if it is just a convenience for the privileged or an essentiality.\n\nSpeaker:\nKaren Sandler"
