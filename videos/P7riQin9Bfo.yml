description: 'If you’re a 2D game developer, a large portion of your game content comes from textures. And in a world with harsh data-caps, devices with low memory, and impatient users, you can’t afford to have a game with bloated flipbook textures. Colt McAnlis introduces you to CRABBY an experimental texture compression codec that aims to reduce your texture footprint for these awesome sprite-based games.'
