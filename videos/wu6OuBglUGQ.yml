description: "All applications, eventually, come down to IO. Well, unless you have uncontrolled side-effects, which would be weird and horrible. This talk explores not only why you want the IO monad in Scala (i.e. why side-effects are weird and horrible), but also how it works. Specifically, we'll be looking at the new cats-effect project, which introduces not only a production-viable IO type for the cats framework, but also a set of typeclasses and rigorous laws for characterizing what an effect type is and how it should behave.\n\nMore details here: http://www.codemesh.io/codemesh2017/daniel-spiewak"
