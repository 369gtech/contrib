By allowing deterministic resource management, destructors enable proper cleanup at the right time. However, implementing destructors correctly can be challenging even for experienced developers, and ensuring destructors are optimized can be critical in high performance code. In this presentation, we’ll examine a series of real world destructors, including some from the C++ Standard Library, to generate a list of best practices.\n— \nPete Isensee\nFacebook Reality Labs\nEngineering Manager\nBellevue, Washington\n\nPete Isensee has programmed video games, shipped three generations of Xbox consoles at Microsoft, created VR experiences at HBO, published dozens of technical articles, and taught C++ tips & tricks to game developers worldwide. Pete is currently a software engineering manager at Facebook Reality Labs (previously Oculus Research), helping unlock the potential of virtual and augmented reality.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
