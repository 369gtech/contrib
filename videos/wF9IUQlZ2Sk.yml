language: English
recordingDate: 1602906410
description: "Open-source software has become a foundational piece of modern software engineering, existing as the platform for everything from personal projects to the most successful products. Open-source is often framed as a good way to garner both visibility and experience, but in that assertion there's a lot of assumptions about how you'll participate. In this talk, we'll cover basics of contributing to open-source and discuss tooling, etiquette, and self-care with the goal of preparing you to start making meaningful contributions to an existing open-source project.\n\nBuild Community-Driven Software Projects on GitHub: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/build-community-driven-projects-github/?WT.mc_id=SDC-8397-ticyren"
