title: 'Colin Jones - A Bug''s Life: What If `Select` Is Broken After All? (Abstractions II Raw Cuts)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1575916043
description: "Presented at Abstractions II, a software conference Code & Supply in Pittsburgh, PA August 21-23, 2019. Learn more at http://www.codeandsupply.co or https://abstractions.io. \n\nThe RAW CUTS series is comprised of selections from a few of our stages wherein the raw video was of high enough quality for C&S to release it before post-production. \n\nPost-production for a community-run conference with as many speakers and as low of a budget as Abstractions is an enormous and time-consuming undertaking. If you're interested in volunteering your time and CPU cycles to help with post-production, we can use your help. Email us at support@codeandsupply.co and we'll get you into the mix. You'll be permitted to credit yourself in the video pre-roll and credits and we'll thank you in this text and on social media.\n\nInterested in sponsoring professional post-production costs in exchange for your company's name and logo in the video forevermore? Contact us at sponsorship@abstractions.io. Opportunities start at $1,000.\n\n-----\nYour project's issue list lies dormant for months, years even. Users seem happy enough, and you've got other priorities. Suddenly, a flurry of users report a crazy-sounding bug. They're seeing a crash, triggered with specific keystrokes, with a common operating system. You can't reproduce it. What in the world?!\n\nYou may have heard the debugging tip from the fantastic book Pragmatic Programmer, \"select isn't broken\". It's always best to assume that bugs are in *your* code. But... what if this one isn't?\n\nIn this talk, you'll re-experience this unusual low-level bug, and take away some lessons for the kinds of debugging we need to do all the time as software developers.\n\nhttps://abstractions.io/schedule/#A%20Bug's%20Life:%20What%20If%20%60Select%60%20Is%20Broken%20After%20All?-Colin%20Jones"
