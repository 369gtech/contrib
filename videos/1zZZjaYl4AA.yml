description: "Doing high quality, original work is what ultimately pushes society forward and improves people's lives. If people started thinking that if they put something high quality and original on Github, a random youtuber would come along and claim it as their own work, then people might just start putting fewer things on GitHub to begin with, and the world would be a worse place. That's why its so critical to not plagiarize. The ideal world we want to live in is one where the people who actually do high quality & original work are the ones who get the credit. It took my reputation blowing up in my face for me to realize that, both in the Neural Qubit paper case & my content more generally. I hope my painful fall serves as a valuable lesson to everyone else.
