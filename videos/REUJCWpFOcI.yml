recordingDate: 1523415268
description: "After ten years, we relaunched the City of Bloomington's public website. While any website migration is difficult, I transition from in-house CMS to Drupal came with a lot of challenges and considerations. This talk reflects on the lessons learned in launching a new website essentially from the ground up while managing your existing web presence.\n\nSome of the things we'll cover include:\n\n- Tackling content debt.\_How we cut the site from several thousand pages to just 500 without causing a mutiny.\n\n- Managing web governance.\_Ways to assign responsibility for managing content across departments, by engaging with stakeholders early and often through the process using actionable goals, documentation & timelines to move things forward.\n\n- Balancing user needs with technical considerations.\_As a development team having to integrate UX considerations and handling content, we had more than just software issues to balance. How do you work with a team of developers to manage these responsibilities, without causing lots of extra work, and keeping users satisfied throughout the process into post-launch."
