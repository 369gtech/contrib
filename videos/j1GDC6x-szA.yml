description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2014\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nGraham Hinchly - Financial Times\n\nABSTRACT\nWith the inexorable rise of native apps, users' minimum expectation is now for a slick, frustration free experience whenever they're using their mobile phones or tablets. But as a web community, we continue to struggle to match the experience of using well designed native apps. In this talk, Graham will look into why that's the case, separating genuine problems from myths by looking at things such as: how much slower are mobile devices really are, whether Javascript execution really is a bottleneck, and the limitations current client-side storage technologies (is AppCache really that bad?) and how developers can look to mitigate the real issues involved in the development of large web applications.\n\nFilled with the experience of the Financial Times team from building, re-building and maintaining a large web application over the last three years, this talk will leave you with a swiss army knife of tools to improve not just the product you produce, but also your development processes.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
