description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM SF 2020 - http://bit.ly/2wpn0SM\n\nGet involved in Code Sync's next conference - https://codesync.global\n\n---\n\nYOUR ERLANG GRAPH FIX\nby Robert Carbone \n\nABSTRACT\nIf you take the word graph out of graphic, all you have is 'ick'.  For even a savvy Erlanger, becoming proficient with our digraph libraries can be a mountainous trek. Mentally traversing data sets is arduous, especially when one keystroke slip can sink it all down a ravine. This talk's aim is to be a source of guidance that breaks the cycle. By the end, you'll be armed with methods & visualization techniques. The path up to the vertex of the mountain will be filled with fewer edges than you thought.\n\nSlides & full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/robert-carbone16/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - \nRobert Carbone has always had an affinity for keyboards - acoustic & digital. Fluent in music theory, graphic design and armed with a Masters of Accountancy, his passion lies in the valuation of intangibles, more specifically, analyzing & graphically representing them in conceptual frameworks.  His journey to develop wearable tech led him to Erlang. Once he got deeper into coding, he recognized a need to make the wxErlang Libraries more accessible to the community.  Robert is currently spearheading the hack of wxErlang's 230+ modules. His recurring code and tutorial publications can be found on ScriptCulture.com. ScriptCulture was founded to elevate awareness of Erlang code & the art of calligraphy and, ultimately, to introduce both into academic curriculum.  When he isn't being an evangelist for Erlang you will find him longboarding around a city, snagging a disc(frisbee) or composing, at a keyboard.\n\nMore on Robert Carbone: https://codesync.global/speaker/robert-carbone16/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM SF 2020\nCode BEAM SF is powered by Code Sync.
