In addition to that, we will overview our current build infrastructure (powered by Koji), different disk image flavors, setup instructions and differences between upstream Fedora and Fedora/RISCV. We will look into future ideas, short-term plans (tentative) for Fedora 30/Rawhide and general wish-list for RISC-V eco-system. \n\nShare with us what is important for you or/and your company.
