description: "For couple of years, Vilius has been building infrastructure to enable developers building node-based apps/services. From the beginning, it was designed to be modular - which is nice on paper, but not so great in an ecosystem that does not have built-in capabilities to manage multi-module projects. So tooling had to be built. And rebuilt. Three times.\n\nVilius walks us though history, evolution and the current state of what we have and how we manage the beast.\n\nFor more engineering updates and insights:\n\n* Follow us on Twitter → https://twitter.com/WixEng\n* Subscribe our monthly newsletter →  https://www.wix.engineering/subscribe\n* Visit our blog →  https://www.wix.engineering/blog\n* Follow our Medium publication →  https://medium.com/wix-engineering"
