Sony, LG, Vizio, and Samsung are all shipping televisions with Google TV built in.\n\nAnd if the rumors that Apple will release a TV this year are true, 2012 will turn out to be the year web developers start to tackle the glass screen hanging on our walls.\n\nWhy should web developers focused on mobile learn about the web on TVs? Because TVs represent the next challenge in device proliferation. They share common characteristics with their smaller brethren. They create new challenges and opportunities we haven't encountered yet. And most importantly, learning how to build for TVs helps inform our practices of building for mobile devices.\n\nAbout Jason: https://twitter.com/grigs\nAbout Mobilism: https://mobilism.nl"
