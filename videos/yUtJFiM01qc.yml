title: 'Introducing Clojure: Lose the fear of parentheses'
language: English
recordingDate: 1592219077
description: "Mashooq Badar, Software Craftsman, and Co-Founder at Codurance, delighted us with a beautiful and useful Clojure introductory presentation that made us lose the fear of parentheses and REPL.\n\nClojure is functional, is dynamic, is general-purpose, and it’s ready to rock. It’s a dialect of Lisp (hence its functional roots) and shares with Lisp the “code as data” philosophy and a powerful macro system."
