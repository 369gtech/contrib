title: 'The Adventurous Developer’s Guide to JVM Languages'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433784709
description: "There are more than 50 actively worked JVM languages in existence today. Some have been ported to the JVM, whereas others were written specifically for the JVM. This hands-on session takes an introductory (but non-Hello, World) look at several JVM languages, including Java 8, Scala, Groovy, Kotlin, Ceylon, Xtend, and Clojure. It covers ZeroTurnaround’s initial experiences, including what rocked and sucked in learning each one. You don’t need any prior knowledge of these languages to attend the session. You will learn whether they are for you and will hear about some real-life experiences of trying these languages for the first time.\n\n\nAuthor:\nSimon Maple\nSimon is a Developer Advocate at ZeroTurnaround and founder of the vJUG (virtualJUG), in addition to being an active member of the London Java Community (LJC) organising group and LJC JCP EC committee member. All of his community efforts culminated in him being awarded Java Champion status in 2014. Simon used to be a tester, developer and technical evangelist for IBM on the WebSphere Application Server for 12 years prior to joining ZeroTurnaround. He's married with a son and dog who he tries to spend as much quality time with as he can.\nView more trainings by Simon Maple at https://www.parleys.com/author/simon-maple\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
