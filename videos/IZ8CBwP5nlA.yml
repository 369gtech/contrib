description: "Slides - https://jtutcher.co.uk/talks/20190714%20PyData%20London.pdf\n\nHow do we spend less time fighting with computers and more time having fun? Software frameworks and managed services promise to save data scientists' time, but often introduce complexity and learning curves. In this session we'll discuss the advantages and costs of adopting these tools, from the experience of a team that's spent the last year building Python recommendation engines and services.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
