description: "Bang Bang!! My Interpreter Shot Me Down! by Julia Tufts\n\nHow does a JavaScript object feel when it’s hit with a !! operator? In this musical ballad, we’ll look at what a !! operator does at a high level and how it can be useful. Then we’ll explore what it does at a lower level, from the perspective of an object seething with resentment. We’ll discover how a !! is parsed and interpreted in V8, by following a multifaceted object’s descent into boolean reduction.\n\nJulia is software engineer based in Brooklyn, originally from Halifax, Canada. She used to study classical music and graph theory, but now makes bleeps, bloops, and bad wordplay. She enjoys imbuing abstract concepts with tenderness."
