description: "There’s one surprising thing which links the VS Code, Slack, WhatsApp, Github and Atom desktop apps together - they have all been built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Thanks to Electron, building these powerful, cross-platform desktop apps is easier than you think. Today we’ll learn how to do just that. We’ll talk about the pros and cons of building Electron apps, and look at a real-world example to see how Slack has been created. We’ll dive into Slack’s architecture, and investigate why we solved some of the problems we faced in the way we did.\n\nEVENT:\n\nJSCamp Barcelona 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nAnuj Nair\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7WvLTgyyqY"
