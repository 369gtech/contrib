The last couple of years this interest has chiefly been fulfilled by working on and with the Axon Framework and how it approaches software architecture. This eventually led him to become a part of the AxonIQ team. There, he currently develops the framework, provides training, helps small and large clients build Axon applications, and an active member of the Axon community. Always keen to learn and improve himself in the software space, he reads up on more abstract concepts like domain driven design, messaging patterns and event sourcing. He also keeps himself up to date with more concrete topics"
