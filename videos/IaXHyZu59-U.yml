description: "TestCon Vilnius 2016. Software Testing & QA Conference. \nOctober 21, 2016 | www.testcon.lt\n\nAs Test Engineers, we have the skills to make a huge difference to our teams and products, and in Selenium, we have a tool to do it. But consistently we are held back by focusing solely on replacing manual testing effort.\n\nThe talk consists of 2 sections. Firstly, it will be discussed how to get the entire team engaged with testing by making the correct choices around automation, including the correct coding languages and frameworks, breaking down the tester / developer divide. Secondly, it will be demonstrated how to use Selenium and wider development skills to bring greater quality to digital products, by building services such as monitoring systems, robust continuous integration and streamlined delivery."
