language: English
recordingDate: 1574100619
description: "We hit 100,000 subscribers! In celebration, I created a recap video that covers where this channel came from, where it is today (including a live look at the numbers), and where it is going in the future. I also answer one of the biggest questions I get asked (honestly, most people ask me a variation on this question), along with getting over the imposter syndrome, getting work experience, and more.\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/IAmTimCorey\nNewsletter signup:  https://signup.iamtimcorey.com/"
