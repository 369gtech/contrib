description: "by Ciara Loftus and Bruce Richardson\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/H.2214/scalable_virtual_switching.webm\n\n\nThe seamless scaling of a vSwitch in relation to changing platform workloads running in VMs/containers in real-time can be difficult, particularly when the workloads and the vSwitch are independent entities. Typically a user/orchestrator must somehow provision vSwitch cores on-the-fly or even over-provision these cores up-front, in order to ensure the vSwitch can handle the traffic going to and from these workloads at any given time.\nThis talk introduces an approach/approaches to vSwitching that distributes the vSwitching work alongside worker cores, and as a result automatically scales with the amount of work being done on the platform. The approach is likely to be superior to existing approaches in terms of compute cost. \n\nRoom: H.2214\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 14:40:00+01"
