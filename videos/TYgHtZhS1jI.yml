title: 'Slice & Dice your Monolith with Domain Driven Design by Edson Yanaga'
language: English
recordingDate: 1510050671
description: "Aren't you tired of hearing that Domain-Driven Design and Bounded Contexts are the \"solution\" for proper slicing your legacy monolithic application? But yet nobody shows you how! Well, not anymore.\n\nWe'll take 20+ years of experience on this field and pack everything on this intensive deep dive session. We'll perform a live coding session starting with a legacy monolith with an anemic domain model. Then we'll constant refactor & restructure the code to show how can we properly encapsulate data and behavior on Bounded Contexts. After that we'll slice & dice code and data and consider some evolutionary steps for your integration. We got it covered: baby steps, CQRS, Event Sourcing, and more! Everything done from a practical and hands-on approach until you (maybe) can reach the eden of distributed Domain Events within your application.\n\n# Edson Yanaga\nEdson Yanaga, Red Hat's Director of Developer Experience, is a Java Champion and Microsoft MVP. He is also a published author and a frequent speaker at international conferences, discussing Java, Microservices, Cloud Computing, DevOps, and Software Craftsmanship."
