description: "Boris Gloger repacks Scrum by presenting a new picture of Scrum/Kanban. The end user plays a new role. The development team, usually bright people, will get acknowledge as skilled professionals. He defines developers in contrast to former scrum ideas not only as people that write code. Instead - developers become the key people in the whole process. Developers will work with end users – no intermediary between business and development. The product owner stays in charge of the stakeholders, making their needs transparent.\n\nThe global dev community meets at WeAreDevelopers, an event dubbed by many as the “Woodstock of Developers”. The WeAreDevelopers World Congress 2018 brought together 8,000 techies from 70 countries for 72-hours of pure dev-fun.\n\nVisit the largest developer playground in Europe!\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/wearedevelopers\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/WeAreDevs\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/_wearedevelopers/\n\n#WeAreDevs\n\n©2018, WeAreDevelopers"
