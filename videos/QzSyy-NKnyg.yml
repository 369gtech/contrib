description: "Managing and Tracking Database Deployments\n\nCJ Estel, CoverMyMeds\n\nWe've all been there, managing multiple environments that all have different SLA's and release schedules. With systems, managing configuration files can be automated with something like Chef or Puppet. With code deployment, tools can easily push out the latest release. Databases present a unique challenge where you can't just push out a current state. You have to identify and walk through every change that has been applied and likely have to install the changes in the same order throughout environments. In this presentation, CJ is going to go over the tool that was developed in-house to address the complexity of database deployments. CoverMyMeds plans to open source this tool. The tool is extensible and at the time of release will support PostgreSQL, MSSQL, and MySQL.\n\nView the full LISA15 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa15/conference-program"
