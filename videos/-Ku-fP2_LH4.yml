description: "Lessons Learned from a Parallel Universe\n\nDavid N. Blank-Edelman, Technical Evangelist, Apcera\n\nJust within the last ten or so years, we have seen at least two separate communities evolve at the crossroads of development and operations. The first—DevOps—grew up very much in public, the second matured sequestered within the halls of “special” companies like Google and Facebook and is only now starting to gain visibility and traction in the wider world. The DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) communities barely speak, yet both have common ancestors and much to offer each other. Let’s look at what they have in common, how they differ, and what are the key things we can learn from both.\n\nDOES16 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
