description: "Achieving a good (and fast and repeatable) build is difficult. This session is a case study of an externally facing API project, complexity caused by dependencies, and different approaches to process and quality. It explores different approaches to organizing build infrastructure, from under-the-desk bare metal, through ad hoc provisioned VMs, and finishing at (now everybody’s favorite!) containers. Attendees will learn\n• Pros and cons of different approaches\n• Differences and quirks of driving apps with containers and VMs\n• Several ideas for testing distributed systems with a complex network of dependencies\n• Cost/benefit ratios of steps taken toward full automation\n• How to fit Java technologies in there\n\nSpeaker:\nAndrzej Grzesik, (?°?°??? ???, _\nI like programming. I do it a lot, mostly on the JVM, creating backends for distributed systems. I also display a particular affection to continuous delivery.. UI, unless quickly hacked, is not my play ;-) I believe that most problems we deal with are people problems, so I mix and match tools with technologies to achieve my goals, make people happy and achieve world peace :-) I believe in software quality, and organize GeeCON, Polish JUG, Krakow Software Craftsmanship, Cracow Hadoop User Group. In my free time, I read paper books and cycle, a lot!"
