description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io\_The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nKubernetes as Service: Extending the Kubernetes Cluster API - Yasong Xu, Baidu \n\nWith the continuous development of cloud native ecosystem, more and more services run their systems on Kubernetes. Baidu supports the creation and destruction of a large number of K8S clusters, elastic scaling, and configuration changes,These operations are cumbersome、complicated and dangerous, HOW to build a stable multi-cluster management system?    Baidu learnt from the declarative way of cluster-api, use CRD to abstract various resources in the cluster to solve the problems like machine heterogeneity, plug-in diversification, and idempotent operation. The administrator k8s cluster can manage 300+ user k8s clusters and 4000+ heterogeneous nodes to ensure that the cluster can be maintained, observed, and traceable. This talk will share the experience of refactoring the traditional cluster management systems into declarative way and how declarative APIs fit into our requirements. \n\nhttps://sched.co/cp99"
