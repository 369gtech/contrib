recordingDate: 1504533662
description: 'Zoomdata is the fastest visual analytics product for big data available on the market. Here we will talk about how RxJava became the key component in its architecture. I want to share our experience with reactive programming and RxJava so that audience will learn about “good” and “bad” stuff based on a real and cool product. Besides, we will talk about performance implications and integration with “big names”, including Apache Spark. Of course, demo included.'
