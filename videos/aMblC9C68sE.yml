Now you’re thinking to yourself: How do I solve these problems?\nWith a sample Express app and some help from PayPal’s open-sourced KrakenJS suite, we’ll show you how!\nDexter is an application developer at PayPal. When not working on Node-based KrakenJS projects, he’s out rock climbing, diving and building reusable UI components and widgets, often at the same time. \n\nLaurence is a PayPal engineer on the SWAT team, and enjoys moving up and down the stack.
