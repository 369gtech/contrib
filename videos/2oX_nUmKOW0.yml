title: 'Subatomic, Supersonic Reactive by Clement Escoffier'
recordingDate: 1581884612
description: "Quarkus (https://quarkus.io) provides a supersonic development experience and a subatomic execution environment thanks to its integration with GraalVM. But, that's not all. Quarkus also unifies the imperative and reactive paradigm. Let's dig into this. This talk is about the reactive side of Quarkus and how you can use it to implement reactive and data streaming applications. From WebSockets to Kafka integration and reactive streams, this talk shows all you need to know to build a reactive system with Quarkus.\n\nClement Escoffier\nRed Hat\n\nRecorded at Jfokus 2020 in Stockholm 4th of february\nhttp://www.jfokus.se"
