description: 'https://developer.oracle.com/code/online | Simon Maple: The Java 9 release brings with it modularity, a new REPL, a new default garbage collector, an HTTP 2 client, multiversion JARs, API updates, and much more. This session uses interactive demos to look at which features really benefit Java developers. The two speakers take turns playing good cop/bad cop on each feature, and you can vote on which features are important to you. The energetic session cuts through the hype to outline how Java 9 will realistically affect the everyday pragmatic developer. You’ll learn what’s in the Java 9 release and how you can benefit from what’s new in Java.'
