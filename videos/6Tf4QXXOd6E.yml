description: "Justin Searls invites us as developers to consider the power of trust. When the software solution we provide to a user fails, that user loses confidence and often turns to a different solution entirely. Breach of user trust leads to a cascade of problems; problems that can impact not just the engineer and software but their entire team and organization.\n\nWatch Justin deliver this keynote to find out how taking a step back and addressing the root causes can help restore trust between user and developer.\n\nEnterpriseNG is a two-day, virtual conference focused on teaching developers and their teams to get the most out of Angular applications in the enterprise.\n\nFollow us on twitter https://twitter.com/ngconf\nOfficial Website: https://enterprise.ng-conf.org/"
