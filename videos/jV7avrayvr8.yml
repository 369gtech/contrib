description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nHow to Build a Cloud Native Image Recognition Solution - Rolando Carrasco, SPS & Akshai Parthasarathy, Oracle \n\nFn Project is an open source project for serverless functions. We want to share how we used Fn, AutoML Natural Language Processing, and K8s to improve older Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology. The resulting image recognition application has been extensively tested at a bank in Mexico. Unlike older OCR tech, the new application does not use pre-defined markers such as “name,” “phone number,” or “address” to extract information. Instead, it works by recognizing these fields using machine learning – even if the ML model has not been trained with a document/picture of that type. The audience will learn how to create and scale serverless functions and Kubernetes. In addition, we will demonstrate how to leverage AutoML to read documents/pictures from any source, classify and extract fields of interest using a pre-trained ML model, store information to a NoSQL database. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ekBw"
