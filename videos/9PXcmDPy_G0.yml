title: 'JDK IO 2016 - Jan Ypma - Building reactive event-sourced systems using Akka and Java 8'
recordingDate: 1474443303
description: 'Event sourcing is an architectural pattern that derives current application state from a journal of changes, called events. Traditionally, this is only internal and not directly visible on a system’s API. An alternative is presented which exposes the events themselves as a real-time streaming REST API. This way, connected systems can materialize their own data, while being deployable and versioned independently. We will talk about how reactive programming helps with keeping the system performant and clusterable, how to deal with past vs. real-time events, what to do with security, in addition to sharing general event sourcing advice.'
