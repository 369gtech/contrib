recordingDate: 1314034685
description: "After graduating from University of Michigan back in 2010, Alex Manwell spent several months working at a high-end Manhattan real estate brokerage, and then a Washington DC- based research company. Both great jobs, both great cities, but he couldn't help but feel like he was missing out on what was happening in Detroit. He began looking for work in Detroit, and was lucky to land a job working at an environmental engineering firm in the region. He moved back and immediately began getting involved in the Hostel. After 7 months, countless cups of coffee, hundreds of phone calls, some minor blunders, and some major strides, Alex is proud to sit on the Board of Directors of Detroit's coolest business: Hostel Detroit.\n\nOpening graphic and video produced by LCC-TV.\nVideos edited by Nick Kwiatkowski."
