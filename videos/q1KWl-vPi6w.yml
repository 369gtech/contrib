description: "Protop: A Package Manager for gRPC and Protocol Buffers - Jeffery Shivers, Toast, Inc \n\nThis presentation will cover a new open source tool called protop (pronounced “proto p”) which enables developers to easily publish and share protocol buffers across code bases. Protop was created as a lightweight solution for projects that need access to the same protobufs, such as common libraries that span multiple services, or even external gRPC APIs. The tool can be plugged into most pipelines or projects with a minimal footprint, and aims to encourage projects to keep protobuf schemas small, portable, and ultimately separate from their implementations. We’ll see how protop works through a few real examples and examine how it might help accomplish good development practices in the world of gRPC, especially in collaborative and open-source contexts."
