description: "Immutable data structures (Dodging Silver Bullets: Accepting Emergent Distributed Architectures)\nThis talk analyzes the conditions that lead us to adopt complex distributed software architectures like microservices. Extending Conwayâ€™s law, we observe that software is a reflection of a technical, social and even economic context and can be well understood as an emergent process. Attendees will learn the virtues and vices of domain partitioning architectures and enough context to apply them coherently."
