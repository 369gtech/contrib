description: "by Stephane Ducasse\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/AW1.125/pharominimalreflectivelang.webm\n\nPharo is a minimalist reflective dynamically typed object-oriented language. Pharo is inspired from Smalltalk: Its full syntax fits on a postcard.\nIts model is simple: everything is an object instance of a class, methods are all public virtual, attributes are first class objects and are protected. There is single inheritance and\ntraits. And nothing else! (see ❮a href=\"http://mooc.pharo.org\"❯http://mooc.pharo.org❮/a❯). Still Pharo is a real language that is started to be used in industry ❮a href=\"http://pharo.org/success\"❯http://pharo.org/success❮/a❯ and ❮a href=\"http://consortium.pharo.org\"❯http://consortium.pharo.org❮/a❯. The entire Pharo stack is MIT.\nPharo reflective core is bootstrapped from source code.  Experiences shows that we can have down to 11k (adding 2 smallint) and that a simple web app can be\ntrim down to 500 kb.\nIn this talk I will present Pharo in a nutshell: Syntax, model, but also user stories.\nI will show the vision of the project and where we want to go. I will present some key architectural choices.\nI will show some powerful features such as stack on the fly reification and their application: contextual breakpoint, on the fly program transformation.\n\n\nBio: I'm one of the core developer of Pharo, head of the consortium and helping consortium engineers.\n\nRoom: AW1.125\nScheduled start: 2020-02-02 09:50:00"
