description: "Commercial Aviation is an amazingly safe mode of transportation with around 50,000 flights each day moving 3 million passengers in the US alone. This modern marvel works through layers of procedures carefully honed over decades of experience. Each time something goes wrong in aviation it is carefully dissected for anything it can teach the industry about performing better, safer, and more reliably.\n\nMany of the hard-won lessons from aviation can be leveraged to build a DevOps team that can routinely take on serious challenges and land the plane every time. In this talk weâ€™ll cover several key concepts from aviation operations, the interesting stories behind them, and how to apply them within your organization.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks, courses, and conferences in the following links:\nhttps://ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
