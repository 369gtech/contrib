title: 'Maps Garage: Exploring Map Data with Crossfilter'
recordingDate: 1369767087
description: "Square's Crossfilter JavaScript library has become a popular base for building multiple, coordinated views into a dataset. In this Google Maps Garage episode, Brendan Kenny demonstrates how to use a Google Map as another type of Crossfilter view, so that selections within histograms or graphs influence what is drawn on the map, while interactions with the map drive what is drawn in the other views.\n\nThe example code for this show is available at https://github.com/brendankenny/crossfilter-and-v3"
