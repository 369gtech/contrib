language: English
recordingDate: 1549371842
description: "It's been about three years we began our big rewrite: tired of mutable data structures and thread synchronisation, we decided to use F# and actor model (Akka.NET) for the next generation of our system. Gigabytes of data are going through our applications every hour with high demand for performance, scalability and failure recovery. \n\nThe fact that our project has for a long time been in production can identify it as success, but is choice of F# an essential part of this success? Could we achieve similar development speed and operational stability if we settled for OOP (and C# on .NET platform)? \n\nWe believe that F# provides a set of defaults that can give significant advantages for development with short deadlines and continuous deployment, and we are going to share our experience and lessons learned in this talk."
