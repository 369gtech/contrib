description: "# It's Not Me, It's You: When Change Gets Personal (Opening Keynote)\n\nKaren Poulter - Head of IT Development and Architecture\n\n\"As people working in technology, developing code, leading teams, businesses, or simply just being people, we are changing the world and the lives of those around us, and being subject to unprecedented change ourselves. Every Single Day.\n\nWe owe it to ourselves and to those around us to understand change and the impact it has on us.\n\nHow can we better prepare users, team mates, prospective clients to trust us with their change? To trust us to make them change?\n\nAnd what happens when we are not the protagonist but the subject of change, maybe we saw it coming, maybe we didnâ€™t. How can we better prepare ourselves?\nFrom a background doing all sorts of tech roles in all sorts of places. From being a mother, wife and not unfamiliar with bumps in the road along the way, this is a personal and light-hearted look at the world today and a few tips learnt along the way that might make your own day to day at little easier.\"\n\n## About nor(DEV):con\n\nThe eastern region's biggest tech conference runs annually in February with a fantastic line-up of speakers and workshops. In our fifth year we joined 41 speakers, over 5 tracks, speaking on a wide range of subjects. Day 1 kicked off with technical deep dives into popular and important languages, frameworks and process. Our key theme for 2020 was wellbeing, with plenty of talks on the main stage around the subject on Day 2, alongside Workshops and plenty of tech talk too.\n\nYou can read more about the line up for 2020 at https://2020.nordevcon.com/ or watch 2021 shape up on our main site https://nordevcon.com/\n\n## About Norfolk Developers\n\nComplementing the existing tech community, Norfolk Developers will be peeling back the high level and going straight to the heart of software development practices and processes.
