title: 'Simplifying Apache Geode with Spring Data - John Blum'
language: ""
recordingDate: 1513269136
description: "Building effective Apache Geode applications quickly and easily requires a framework that provides the right level of abstraction. In this session we take Alan Kay's infamous quote \"Simple things should be simple; Complex things should be possible\" to a whole new level with Spring Data Geode using Spring Boot. I'll show you how the new Annotation-based configuration model, which builds on existing concepts like SD Repositories, Spring's Cache Abstraction and Apache Geode CQ, helps you rapidly build working Apache Geode client/server applications in minutes. We end the session with a quick look at the roadmap and what users can expect next. You won't want to miss this.\n\nJohn Blum, Staff Engineer, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2017"
