description: "Recording brought to you by American Express https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs\nIn this talk, you'll learn about how we successfully rewrote the website of a major scientific publisher to pure Kotlin, serving millions of daily requests and in the process created the open source http4k microservice toolkit.\n\nThe talk also covers how the team migrated the stack to Continuous Delivery-based deployment into a private on-premise cloud, and how http4k helped us introduce new failure-mode and inter-service contract testing techniques.\n\nThis approach combines functional programming concepts and the versatility of Kotlin to produce applications that are simpler and more testable than most Java are accustomed to experience. And the best of it: with absolutely no magic!\n\nAbout the Presenter:\nIvan Sanchez is a developer and coach with over 15 years of commercial experience. He has worked in a variety of industries and has been an advocate of Agile and eXtreme Programming practices such as TDD and Pair Programming over the last decade. A considerable portion of his coding experience is in Java and the last few years has been switching to Kotlin as his primary language of choice. He's been successful delivering Kotlin code to production and is the co-author of http4k: a lightweight HTTP library for Kotlin.\n\nDavid Denton\nHighly experienced Tech Lead polyglot specialising in TDD, software craft, debt resolving, mentoring and straight talking.
