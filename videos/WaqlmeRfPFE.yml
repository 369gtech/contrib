title: 'AI and Creativity: Using Generative Models To Make New Things'
language: English
recordingDate: 1514048403
description: "I値l discuss Magenta, a Google Brain project investigating music and art generation using deep learning and reinforcement learning. I値l describe the goals of Magenta and how it fits into the general trend of AI moving into our daily lives. One crucial question is: Where does AI and Machine Learning fit in the creative process? I値l argue that it痴 about augmenting and extending the artist rather than just creating artifacts (songs, paintings, etc.) with machines. I値l talk about two recent projects. In the first, we explore the use of recurrent neural networks to extend musical phrases in different ways. In the second we look at teaching a neural network to draw with strokes. This will be a high-level overview talk with no need for knowledge of AI or Machine Learning.\n\nEVENT:\n\nML Conf 2017\n\nSPEAKER: \n\nDoug Eck\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nML Conf Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permissions to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nML Conf YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjeM1xxYb_37bZfyparLS3Q\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD3PCXdHLbs"
