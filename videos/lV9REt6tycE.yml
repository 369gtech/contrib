description: "Originally published: February 15, 2006\n\nOn Monday, we had the honor of meeting with Bill Gates to discuss MIX06, IE, DHTML, AJAX, Compatibility, Office 12, and also gain insight into where he surfs on the web. :)\n\nHe also shares with us where and how software can make the world a better place.\n\nThis is the second time we've had Bill on C9 and he wants to do more interviews, covering a wide array of topics. How cool is that? He thinks Channel 9 is a \"phenomenon\". We're honored. Thank you, Bill!\n\nOriginal Channel 9 Post: https://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/Charles/Seventeen-Minutes-With-Bill"
