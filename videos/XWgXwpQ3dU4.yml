title: 'Connect Your Functions with RSocket'
language: English
recordingDate: 1601027912
description: "\"In this session, we discuss the new Spring Cloud Stream binder for RSocket,  a mechanism for binding sources and targets of network streams to inputs and outputs of plain old Java functions. And that is the most interesting part of the sessionâ€”the functions. We discuss how functions communicate with each other in the cloud over RSocket. We review how different function signatures map to the RSocket API. We also talk about how to use the RSocket Routing Broker to route messages and supply features like consumer groups to the RSocket binder.\n\nThis session will have a 50/50 live code to slide ratio.\"\n\nSpencer Gibb, Spring Cloud Core Lead at VMware; Oleg Zhurakousky, Software Engineer at VMware\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/connect-your-functions-with-rsocket"
