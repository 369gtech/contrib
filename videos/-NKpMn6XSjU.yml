Most Rails applications are no longer MVPs, but they grew from MVPs and usually contain a lot of legacy code that \"just works.\"\n\nAnd this legacy makes shipping new features harder and riskier: the new functionality have to co-exist with the code written years ago, and who knows what will blow up next?\n\nI've been working on legacy codebases for the last few years, and I found turning legacy code into a legendary code to be a very exciting and challenging process.\n\nI want to share the ideas and techniques I apply to make legacy codebases habitable and to prepare a breeding ground for the new features."
