description: "by John Griffith\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/UD2.120/grpcohmy.webm\n\n\ngRPC is an open source remote procedure call framework built on HTTP/2 that provides an easy way to create high performance, scalable APIs in a multitude of programming languages. \n\nIn this talk we’ll describe what grPC is, how we it came to be, and compare it to some other alternatives.  We’ll talk about the pros and cons and hopefully convince you to take a closer look at it and add it to your toolbox. \n\nBest of all we’ll walk through an example of how to build a gRPC based application using gRPC, Protobufs and Go!  We’ll even take a look at how easy it is to add a client using another programming language. \n\nRoom: UD2.120 (Chavanne)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 14:00:00+01"
