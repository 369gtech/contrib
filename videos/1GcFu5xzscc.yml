description: "The Inside-Out of Creating a DevOps Movement\n\nEddie Garcia, DevOps Practice Manager, Bluware Inc\n\nYou don't always have the luxury of a top down DevOps initiative, what is a non-conforming DevOps minded individual to do? Become a DevOps guerrilla and start a grassroots DevOps movement. The presentation will center around two cases Microsoft:Mac Office and a major Oil and Gas R&D department. In both of these situations there was resistance and non-technical obstacles to overcome and in the end change was brought from the bottom up. What is offered are techniques to use to build consensus and momentum for your very own grassroots DevOps movement.\n\nDOES16 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
