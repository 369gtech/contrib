description: "by Richard Barry\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/AW1.126/riscvfreertos.webm\n\n\nThe open source (now MIT licensed) FreeRTOS kernel has been helping embedded developers manage the complexity of their microcontroller designs for 15 years â€“ during which time FreeRTOS has gained a reputation for reliability, ease of use, and responsive support.  FreeRTOS now runs on RISC-V!  In this talk you will see how easy it it to execute the FreeRTOS kernel in open source RISC-V emulators and on physical RISC-V microcontrollers, as well as learn how to port the FreeRTOS kernel to new RISC-V implementations. \n\nRoom: AW1.126\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 14:45:00+01"
