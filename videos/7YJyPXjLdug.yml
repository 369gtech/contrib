description: "Recording brought to you by American Express. https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs\n#GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. In the GraphQL world, the schema plays a central role as it defines all the fields and types that can be queried by the clients. This makes GraphQL APIs extremely powerful as clients use this information to custom tailor their queries to only ask for the data they need.\n\nKotlin strong types and null safety makes it an excellent choice for implementing GraphQL schemas. In this talk we'll show you how graphql-kotlin can transform this potentially tedious schema generation process into a breeze. With code-only, or resolver-first, approach graphql-kotlin generates schemas directly from the source code making it the single source of truth for defining your GraphQL APIs. Using this approach, your Kotlin classes, properties and functions are mapped to corresponding GraphQL types and fields. Furthermore, since the GraphQL queries are resolved by invoking underlying Kotlin functions we can also utilize the power of Kotlin coroutines to asynchronously process all of our requests!\n\nLearn how to utilize the power of Spring Boot together with graphql-kotlin to easily create new reactive GraphQL web services in 15 minutes or less!\n\nResources:\nKotlinConf website: https://jb.gg/fyaze5\nKotlinConf on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlinconf\n\nKotlin website: https://jb.gg/pxrsn6\nKotlin blog: https://jb.gg/7uc7ow\nKotlin on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlin\n\n#KotlinConf19 #Kotlin #JetBrains\n\nAbout the Presenters:\nDariusz Kuc is a principal software engineer at Expedia Group based out of Expedia’s Chicago office.
