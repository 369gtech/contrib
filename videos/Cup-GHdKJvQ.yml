description: "Tobias Kunze\n\nHistory is full of weird events. Because we're human (and weird), these events tend to have their reasons in social dynamics that are still around today.\n\nAmidst a software industry reinventing everything from first principles, let's see if we can't actually learn a bit from ancient history. Featuring, in no particular order, the BDFL of the Catholic church, pneumatic tubes, CÃ¦sar's legacy, right- and left side traffic, hostile acquisitions, high-frequency trading, and of course Python 2."
