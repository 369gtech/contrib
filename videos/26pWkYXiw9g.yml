title: 'Rapid App Development With React Native: Lessons Learned at NSB - Eirik Wendel'
recordingDate: 1535452314
description: "NSB's mobile apps sell millions of train tickets to millions of travellers yearly. This past year, these apps have undergone their biggest ever technical and functional improvements. Specifically, the way tickets are bought, stored and validated in inspection has been totally revamped. The star of this story? React Native.\nThroughout this process the team has learned a lot, and made both good and bad experiences regarding technology, development process and teamwork â€“ basically how we do digital product development. The result has since made its way to several hundred thousand Norwegian smartphones throughout the land, from warm living rooms to cold railway platforms. In this talk, you'll learn a bit about that red app you might have on your smartphone. You'll hear our experiences doing cross-plattform mobile development with React Native in a large, existing app. Lastly, you'll follow our team's journey from idea to production for our largest feature ever."
