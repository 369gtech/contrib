recordingDate: 1553178972
description: "I'm Ari Hunt and I'm 9 years old. For the last 3 years, my dad has been helping me learn how to code and I'd like to show you the tools we used. Some of them helped me learn to code before I could read, some of them helped me learn when I just wanted to play and others actually taught me how to build real web pages. I hope that people who watch my talk will go home and teach their own kids how to code after seeing some of these awesome tools!\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
