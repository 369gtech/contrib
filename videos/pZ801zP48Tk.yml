description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nMulti-tenancy vs. Multi-cluster: When Should you Use What? - Tasha Drew, VMware; Ryan Bezdicek, Medtronic; Adrian Ludwin, Google; Jim Bugwadia, Nirmata\n\nThe Kubernetes Working Group for Multi-Tenancy has a lot of fun projects helping people throughout the Kubernetes ecosystem manage sharing clusters. One question that comes up a lot is \"when should I share a cluster using multi-tenancy, and when should I spin up multiple clusters?\" We call this multi-tenancy versus multi-cluster. There are also a lot of people who are doing both simultaneously! People want to know when to do which, and we're here to help. Join this panel with the technical leads and chair of the Multi-tenancy working group to hear our thoughts on multi-tenancy versus multi-cluster, in a panel format."
