description: "Designing user interfaces for products that are available on multiple computing platforms has been an ongoing challenge for decades. The introduction of mobile and tablet computing platforms in the last decade has forced us to fundamentally rethink parts of UI design, and has raised questions about the kinds of experiences a product can or should offer on new and increasingly different platforms.\n\nThe ecosystem of devices that end-users access their products on continues to shift. We have smaller tablets, large and extra large phones, tablet/laptops that support both physical and hardware keyboards, TVs and video game consoles, and we have just started to scratch the surface of wearables, and extended reality platforms. The trend is only going to continue, and it’s time to start thinking literally “outside of the box” about designing robust user-interfaces, for all emerging platforms.\n\nHasan Ahmad\nPrincipal Consultant, Aquent DEV6\nhttps://twitter.com/has_ibr_ahm\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc\n\nSave 10% off any FITC event with discount code 'youtube'.\nSee our upcoming events at www.fitc.ca"
