description: "Google Faulty Summit 2010\r\nJuly 29, 2010\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nPresented by Ulfar Erlingsson, Manager, Security Research.\r\n\r\nSoftware-as-a-service can provide great benefits, such as ubiquitous, reliable access to data, but cloud computing also raises new challenges and opportunities for computer security. Large-scale Web services must address both traditional security concerns, such as user authentication and key management, as well as newer issues like those raised by the need to maintain users' privacy. At the same time, cloud computing has innate security advantages, such as its use of easily updated and malleable software, which enables instrumentation ranging from individual specialization to large-scale execution summarization. This talk will briefly outline some of these issues and potential research topics in cloud security, with examples from Google's past and current technology efforts used to give context."
