title: 'DrupalCon Vienna 2017: Testing small to medium size client projects with Behat'
recordingDate: 1506528431
description: "Automated testing has a lot of benefits: it reduces maintenance costs, improves software quality, speeds up time to market\_and prevents embarrassing regressions. In the long run having a test suite saves time and money for any project. However in practice most small to medium size client projects are delivered without any tests. Why? Because tests have the reputation to be\_expensive and difficult to write. Luckily with Behat this is no longer the case: tests can be written in plain English in a few minutes.\n\nThis presentation shows how you can use Behat, Drupal Extension and Travis CI to provide cheap and effective testing for any project."
