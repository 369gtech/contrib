description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nFrom Kubernetes to PaaS to Developer Control Planes- Daniel Bryant, Ambassador Labs\n\nDevelopers building applications on Kubernetes today are being asked to not just develop applications -- they are also responsible for releasing and running their applications, too. In this talk, we’ll discuss the secular shift towards what Netflix calls “Full Cycle Development” or what Google calls “Service Ownership”. With developers managing so much of the cloud-native development loop, a new class of infrastructure has emerged -- the developer control plane. We’ll explore the evolution from Kubernetes to PaaS, to the developer control planes in use today. We’ll draw on our personal experiences and podcast chats with the larger CNCF community, and discuss real-world examples of developer control planes used at New Relic, Spotify, InVision, and Twitter. We’ll wrap this talk with a walk through of the CNCF ecosystem through the developer control plane lens, and look at what’s next in the future of this important emerging category."
