recordingDate: 1412862718
description: "In this session we'll explore the social and practical reasons why code reviews aren't as widely adopted in modern software development shops as they should be. We'll also look at a few concrete tools and techniques that teams can put in place to help them overcome the most common road blocks.\n\nIn the end, we'll see how code reviews help peers leverage each other's knowledge and skills to ensure their work is as good as it can possibly be."
