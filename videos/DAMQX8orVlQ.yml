description: "Transactional System Administration Is Killing Us and Must be Stopped\n\nThomas A. Limoncelli, Stack Overflow\n\nTransactional system administration puts sysadmins in a bad position. When organizations replace this model with a service-centric model the company receives better service and sysadmins gain positive visibility and increase their value.\n\nThe transactional model is where customers make requests and system administrators fulfill them. It is the model of servitude. This has been the power dynamic for decades. The service-centric model is where sysadmins maintain the automation that does work rather than doing the work themselves. Another way to look at it is that the best use of human labor in an auto factory is not to build cars, but to maintain the robots that build cars.\n\nStack Exchange's SRE Team is making strides at minimizing transactional system administration and, instead, adopting DevOps practices that create a cooperative relationship with our users. We've adopted this as our guiding management principle and it has greatly improved how we get things done.\n\nTom will discuss the successes and failures of these attempts and recommend how your organization can adopt this better structure.\n\nView the full LISA15 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa15/conference-program"
