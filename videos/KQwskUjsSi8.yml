description: "All the software's a stage,And all the components merely actors;They have their exits and their entrances,And they send each other messages.\nDid Shakespeare write that? Perhaps not exactly. Never mind, this talk is about modern times, so modern that some developers no longer find proven OO paradigm convincing and instead ride new waves - or should I say - newly discovered old waves, since we'll talk about actor model.\n\nIt's been a year since our team commenced a media distribution project using Akka.NET. Queues and cloud storage providers, millions of files, all managed by actors. What did we learn? What did we gain? Come to our talk and you'll know!"
