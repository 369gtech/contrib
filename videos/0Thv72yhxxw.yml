This shift has brought a dramatic change in programming paradigms in the pursuit of a common language that will provide efficiency and performance portability across these systems. A wide range of programming languages and models has emerged over the last decade, all with this goal in their sights, and the trend is converging on C++ as the language of choice.\n\nThis new world of heterogeneous systems brings with it many new challenges for the C++ community and for the language itself, and if these were to be overcome then C++ would have the potential to standardize the future of heterogeneous programming. In fact this work has already begun in SG14 in form of a mandate to support massive parallel dispatch for heterogeneous devices in the C++ standard using recent models such as SYCL and HPX. A recent approach to solving these challenges comes in the form of SYCL, a shared-source C++ programming model for OpenCL. SYCL takes a very different approach from many before it, in that it is specifically designed to be standard C++ without any extensions to the language.\n\nThis talk will present the recent rise in demand for heterogeneous programming in C++ and the new challenges that this brings to the C++ community. It will then take a look at some of the different programming languages and models that have arrived in the heterogeneous landscape, the motivations behind them, how they have attempted to solve those challenges and what we can learn from them. Finally it will take a look at the future of heterogeneous programming in C++ and what that might look like.\n— \nGordon Brown\nStaff Software Engineer, SYCL, Codeplay Software\nGordon Brown is a software engineer specializing in SYCL technologies and has been involved in the standardization of the Khronos standard and the development of Codeplay's implementation from it's inception.\n\nMichael Wong\nCodeplay Software/ISOCPP\nVP of R&D/Director\nMichael Wong is the CEO of OpenMP. He is the Canadian representative to the C++ Standard and OpenMP Committee. He is also a Director of ISOCPP.org and a VP, Vice-Chair of Programming Languages for Canada’s Standard Council. He has so many titles, it’s a wonder he can get anything done.\nHe chairs the WG21 SG5 Transactional Memory and SG14 Games Development/Low Latency, and is the co-author of a number C++11/OpenMP/Transactional Memory features including generalized attributes, user-defined literals, inheriting constructors, weakly ordered memory models, and explicit conversion operators. Having been the past C++ team lead to IBM’s XL C++ compiler means he has been messing around with designing C++ compilers for twenty years. His current research interest, i.e. what he would like to do if he had time is in the area of parallel programming, transactional memory, C++ benchmark performance, object model, generic programming and template metaprogramming. He holds a B.Sc from University of Toronto, and a Masters in Mathematics from University of Waterloo.\n\nHe has been asked to speak at ACCU, C++Now, Meeting C++, ADC++, CASCON, Bloomberg, CERN, and many Universities, research centers and companies.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
