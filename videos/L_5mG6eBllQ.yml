language: English
recordingDate: 1605206178
description: "Multiplex tcp requests through Envoy HTTP/2 stack - Yuchen Dai\n\nThis talk will go over the recent update of HTTP/2 CONNECT support in Envoy. Envoy not only can terminate or proxy an H2 CONNECT, but also proxy the raw tcp plain text request in establish H2 CONNECT. In this talk, Yuchen will also go through the on going efforts to optimize the CONNECT dispatch. With these efforts, Yuchen will demonstrate istio sidecar proxy(which is literally Envoy) tunnels http requests and raw tcp requests into HTTP2, multiplexed in one TLS/TCP connection as if the request is directly established by application."
