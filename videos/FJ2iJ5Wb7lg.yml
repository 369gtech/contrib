description: "Speaker: Burr Sutter / Kamesh Sampath (Red Hat)\n\nIn this session we will start to see “What is Serverless” and what it means to you? We will continue our journey to quickly deploy a serverless platform Apache OpenWhisk on Kubernetes. With the platform ready, we will then move on to demystify what your Java programming model in the serverless world should be. Is this enough for you to build your serverless applications? the answer is an overwhelming NO. You will also need the “tools” to build your serverless applications. Along the way, we will also do a stock check for the inventory of tools that can make the serverless journey quick, easy and productive.\n\nA lifelong developer advocate, community organizer, and technology evangelist, Burr Sutter is a featured speaker at technology events around the globe—from Bangalore to Brussels and Berlin to Beijing (and most parts in between)—he is currently Red Hat’s Director of Developer Experience. A Java Champion since 2005 and former president of the Atlanta Java User Group, Burr founded the DevNexus conference—now the second largest Java event in the U.S.—with the aim of making access to the world’s leading developers affordable to the developer community. When not speaking abroad, Burr is also the passionate creator and orchestrator of highly-interactive live demo keynotes at Red Hat Summit, the company’s premier annual event."
