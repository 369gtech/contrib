Everything is clean and in perfect order for that dashboard or analysis. But two weeks later, the logic needs to change, or a new source of data needs to be pulled in. What happens to a pipeline over time?\n\nIn this talk, we'll be using Devoted's marketing pipelines as an example of what can go right and wrong when building a pipeline that needs to adapt quickly to changing business logic.\n\n-----\n\nTanya Rudakevych is a data scientist at Devoted Health, a new healthcare company offering Medicare Advantage plans, where she focuses on marketing and sales analytics. She previously worked on a team at IBM Watson Health to develop an application for primary care providers. She lives in Boston and likes to read and hike in her spare time."
