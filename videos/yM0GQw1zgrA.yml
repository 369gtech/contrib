description: "Google stores all its source code in one single monolithic repository! Imagine 25,000 software developers working simultaneously on 86 TB of data, including two billion lines of code in 9 million unique source files. Each week, there are as many lines of code changed as there are lines in the full Linux kernel repository. How does Googleâ€™s source code works at this scale? What are the advantages and drawbacks of such an approach? Come and learn about what it means to work on such a big mammoth repository.\n\nGuillaume Laforge is Developer Advocate at Google, in the Google Cloud Platform team. He's well-known for his decade-long work on the Apache Groovy programming language project, for which he serves as Chair of the Project Management Committee at the Apache Software Foundation. Guillaume is also a co-founder of the French tech podcast \"Les Cast Codeurs\".\n\n[YJP-1600]"
