recordingDate: 1402477225
description: "Tony Rogvall is a programmer and entrepreneur who has been active for more than thirty years in the computer business. With an education (M.Sc) in mathematics and computer science, Tony's first task as the first employee at Prover Technology (www.prover.com) was to develop a ground breaking formal verification and proof system for safety critical systems in nuclear- train-, automotive- and the aviation industries.\n\nIn 1993 he joined Ericsson CSLab, computer science laboratory, as a co-worker and a co-designer of the computer programming language Erlang. Major contributions include work in the SMP area, around 1996, to allow the Erlang runtime system to execute truly parallel.\n\nAround the millennium shift, a group from CSLab formed the company Bluetail AB, a company that developed Internet related products mainly developed in Erlang, to make Internet a more robust place. Bluetail AB was sold to Alteon web systems which in turn was bought by Nortel networks a few weeks later. At Alteon/Nortel Tony developed SSL accelerators and SSL VPN products.\n\nA couple of years later Tony was a free man and started Synapse Mobile Networks (www.synap.se) together with Per Bergqvist and Lars Lindgren. Their main business is to develop and device management systems that configure and update mobile handsets with settings for internet/mms/email access. As of today the company servers has configured around 1 Billion handsets around the world.\n\nIn recent years Tony has been developing products in various projects and companies: Power distribution for 12/24 v systems (www.seazone.se), fan/vault control systems.  CAN bus related systems, CANopen stack in Erlang, low level programming for LPC2129. In other words, back to where it all started, with fun and games. In 2012, he co-founded Feuerlabs in order to re-invent device management for Connected Devices."
