description: 'So you want to buy a painting, but not sure which one. Or where to place it? we have a solution. Just use your phone for this. Augmented reality becomes more popular in recent years. Companies like Apple or Google invests tons of money to develop AR support. Smartphones became powerful enough to deal with all these new features. And it''ll be ridiculous not to use all this power when looking for the best place to put a piece of art. In this talk we''ll be looking at ARKit from Apple and the ways how we can use it with React Native. We''ll be building a simple app to hang paintings on the wall and learning how to deal with newest AR technologies.'
