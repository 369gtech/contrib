title: 'DrupalCon Nashville 2018: (In)organic Groups in D8 - the Group module'
recordingDate: 1523569483
description: 'We will explore the Group module as an alternative to the widely-adopted Organic Groups (OG) module solution in D7. The D8 version of OG is still very much in question and, unless you need to migrate a site from D7 OG, this is THE future of a Drupal site needing “OG”-like power to control access to different entities based on membership in a group! That may not even be true either, as the maintainer of the Group module is considering a migrate path from D7 OG to D8 Group! Discover the power of a module properly using the D8 Entity API and the flexibility and usability that comes with it! Along with that, natural integrations with D8 core field API, Views in core make this module a stand-out for building group-based content workflows in Drupal.'
