description: "(Recorded at Jfokus 2016. http://www.jfokus.com)\n\nCoding Culture\n\nImagine a culture where the input of the whole organization turns an individual idea into a user story in just a couple of hours, where everybody's goal is to make the customer's job easier and more effective, and where you work on projects you love instead of projects you loathe. A great coding culture concentrates on making developers productive and happy by removing unnecessary overhead, bringing autonomous teams together, helping the individual programmer to innovate, and raising awareness among developers about how to create better code. I will talk about how to establish and foster a strong engineering-focused culture that scales from a small team to a huge organization with hundreds of developers. Culture matters!\n\nSven Peters, Atlassian\n\nSven is a software geek working as an Evangelist for Atlassian. He started with Java development in 1998 and has been programming for longer that he'd like to admit. Besides coding his passion is getting the right tools into the hands of those who need it to help build fast moving, agile, autonomous teams and getting them to kick-ass. Sven has extensive speaking experience in 25+ countries on myriad topics."
