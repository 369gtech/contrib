description: "This session explores the visual expressiveness of JavaFX and discusses how to create highly interactive and dynamic visualizations. Among other things, it takes a look at hierarchical graph visualization and discusses how to implement automatic rule-based scene graph optimization for visualizing vast amounts of data. As an example, you will visualize and manipulate semantic networks, abstract syntax trees (ASTs), workflows, and other graphs. The second part of the session explains how to create amazing interactive physical simulations with JavaFX and apply physical behavior to layouts and JavaFX controls. You will get full access to powerful multitouch sample applications that utilize controls from JFXtras, VWorkflows, and Enzo.\n\n\nAuthor:\n Michael Hoffer\nMichael Hoffer is a computer scientist working at the Goethe-Center for Scientific Computing in Frankfurt, Germany and co-founder of Digital Brain Factory. Hoffer is the developer of VRL-Studio, an innovative visual programming environment that combines visual and text-based programming. Currently he is doing his PhD at the Department of Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of Frankfurt, Germany. His research interests are developing visual programming concepts in the field of modeling and simulation of highly complex physical processes. Hoffer's long-term goal is to create a visual general-purpose programming language based on the Java platform.
