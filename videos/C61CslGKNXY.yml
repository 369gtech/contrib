description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM V 2020 - https://codesync.global/conferences/code-beam-sto/\n\nAdventures in High Performance Logging | Ryan Resella - Senior Software Engineer at Change.org\n\nABSTRACT\nWhat do you do when you need to write to a log in your Elixir app?\nUse Logger, of course!\nBut what happens when you reach its limits?\nThis talk uses a real-world example to explore what happens when your system scales past the tools that come with the BEAM. We'll build our way from Logger, to disk_log, to a custom GenStage pipeline, all the while striving for the highest performance solution.\n\nOBJECTIVES\nEducate the audience about one of the core internal Elixir tools: Logger\nProvide a case study of what happens when you rapidly outgrow the tooling in the BEAM\nIntroduce some new libraries that provide an abstraction over high throughput logging\n\nTARGET AUDIENCE\nFrom beginners through to experienced Alchemists, the talk builds up from simple example so no-one should get lost.\n\n\n• Follow us on social:\n  Website: https://codesync.global/conferences/code-beam-sto\n  Twitter: https://twitter.com/CodeBEAMio\n\n• Looking for a unique learning experience?\n  Attend the next Code Sync conference near you! \n  See what's coming up at: https://codesync.global \n\n• SUBSCRIBE TO OUR CHANNEL\n  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC47eUBNO8KBH_V8AfowOWOw"
