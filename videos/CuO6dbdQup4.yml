description: "Coaching How does a Technical Agile Coach improve work in a development team? For years I’ve helped set up Coding Dojos as a space for teams to learn the theory and practice of TDD. All too often the initiative fizzles out and the dojos stop happening when I’m no longer there. Without technical practices like TDD and Refactoring, agile adoptions can also fizzle out. The latest research into DevOps shows that organisational culture, team collaboration and learning is really important for success. Recently I have been using Mob Programming as a way to improve team culture and spread healthy technical agile practices in a team's production codebase.\n\nI've found that this in combination with shorter dojo-like daily learning sessions is really effective at changing behaviour. In this talk I'd like to share my experiences of what I've found to work in real teams.\n\nThis video was recorded at SCLConf 2018, an annual conference for software professionals that care about their craft.
