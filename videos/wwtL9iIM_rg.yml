description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nHaving Cloud Native Fun with HonkCTL - Jeffrey Sica, Red Hat \n\nIn the last year, geese have come to symbolize a harbinger of chaos in the technical community. Many have taken this opportunity to post many GIFs and make many jokes. One of the jokes, is a Kubernetes-based CTF game called honkCTL. This talk will outline why having fun benefits communities, where HonkCTL came from, and will spin up a HonkCTL instance that mischievous cloud-native fowls can play at home. Included in this talk will also be a sneak peek at the next game being cooked up at HonkCI Laboratories. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ekBS"
