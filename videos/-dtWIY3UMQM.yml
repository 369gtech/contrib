Instead of forgoing structured bindings, fold expressions, and other additions, what if we could use them even on pre-2014 compilers? \n\nEnter clang-from-the-future, a transpiler that reads C++17 programs and outputs standard C++11 source code. When used as a preprocessing step, it allows any compiler with C++11 support to compile a subset of C++14/17 programs. To enable this, CTFT rewrites new language features based on the program's abstract syntax tree and provides drop-in implementations for standard library additions. \n\nIn this talk, I will show how specifically this is achieved, how well it works in practice, and what's left to be done in the future. \n\nThe source code for CFTF can be downloaded here: https://github.com/neobrain/cftf\n— \nTony Wasserka, Freelance Software Developer\n\nLow-level anything: Tony is a freelancer and long-term C++ enthusiast who has worked on the console emulator projects Dolphin (GameCube/Wii), PPSSPP (PSP), and Citra (3DS) since 2010. More recently, he has worked on Vulkan graphics drivers for PowerVR graphics processors. His main interest is exploring C++'s zero-cost abstraction capabilities and applying them to create better software for resource-constrained environments.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
