description: "Java agents are a little-known but extremely powerful part of the Java ecosystem. Agents are able to transform existing classes at runtime, allowing scenarios such as logging and monitoring, hot reload or gathering code coverage. However, their usage presents a number of pitfalls as well.\n\nIn this talk we will present the steps of writing a java agent from scratch, indicate various common mistakes and pain points and draw conclusions on best practices.\n\nAfter this talk participants will have a better understanding of the Java instrumentation API and about should / should not be done with it.\n\nWorking as a Senior Computer Scientist at in the AEM Cloud Foundation team at Adobe, Robert Munteanu is a software developer with a passion for Open Source. He contributes to multiple Open Source projects, such as Apache Sling, Apache Jackrabbit, MantisBT and the Eclipse Plugin for ReviewBoard. Robert is a frequent conference speaker, having spoken at Devoxx, ApacheCon and EclipseCon."
