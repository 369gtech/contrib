recordingDate: 1446772427
description: "Mike McGarr, Engineering Manager, Netflix\n\nA significant chunk of DevOps rhetoric centers around “unicorn” companies like Netflix, Etsy, Facebook and many more. They are held up as the models enterprises should emulate. But what makes a place like Netflix so special? What does life inside a unicorn company look like? Is the famous Netflix culture deck true to life or just hype? Most importantly, what lessons can I take back to my employer?\n\nIn this talk, I’ll share with you the reality of working at Netflix. I’ll share details about how people work at Netflix, how we communicate, how we are organized, how work is prioritized, how we manage risk, how we build teams and how our culture plays a central role in everything we do. Lastly, Mike will share what are the important lessons that every manager and executive should learn about Netflix’s culture."
