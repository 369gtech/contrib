This comes both with ergonomics improvements, but also with stabilisation of a lot of use-case specific features.\nRust is now usable and is used on everything from bare metal microcontrollers over small IoT gateway systems up to server programming. It can be deployed on phones just as it can be deployed in your web browser through Webassembly (WASM). That makes the newest edition of Rust the only currently available memory-safe language that can be used in almost any contexts without the need of a runtime.\nThis talk gives you a tour of what is possible with just one language and just one compiler right now.\nFinally, Rust 2018 includes a lot of ergonomics improvements like a better async/await-story and cleverer safety [...]\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotoams.nl/2019/sessions/751\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOamst\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttp://gotocon.com\n#Rustlang #IoT #WebAssembly #WASM"
