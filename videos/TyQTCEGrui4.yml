description: "Tom Easterbrook\n\nSaturday 15th, 11:30 (Room D)\nA talk (25 minutes)\n\nBeing born with Cerebral Palsy has presented me with many challenges thankfully, we are in the grips of a technical revolution and it may surprise you how much of this technology has had a massive impact on my life and enabled my independence to be greatly improved.\n\nMy love of technology has helped me to embrace many things from social networking to smart assistants to improve my life including, in my professional work where I use a Python library to partially code by using my voice.\n\nIn this talk, I will discuss the label of assistive technology and why more technologies than you would traditionally think in my view are assistive. I will also discuss the risks forced upon me to achieve that level of independence and where I believe the technology of the future has a role to play in further increasing my independence.\n\nAbout the speaker\n\nTom is a Computing student at Bournemouth University in South West England. Despite being born with Quadriplegic Cerebral Palsy he has used his love and passion for technology to propel himself forward, grounded in a firm interest of current affairs and the world around him. Tom is currently looking for opportunities to combine both of these passions.\n\n    The speaker suggested this session is suitable for new programmers.\n    The speaker suggested this session is suitable for teachers."
