description: 'As you can see from the presentation description, each developer can find something interesting in ESB (Enterprise Service Bus) world. For beginners: history, theory of integration patterns, ESB vendors, ‘Hello World’ sample, ESB flow structures, connectors, message structure and Mule Studio. For advanced developers additional topics will be presented: performance, memory management, error handling, testing and CloudHub. I hope my presentation will help you familiarize and understand ESB (Mule ESB) philosophy.'
