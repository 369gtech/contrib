description: 'Serverless Functions are hot and developer and corporate interest is exploding! But let?s face it, although Java is one of the most popular programming languages in the world it isn?t the most popular language for writing functions?at least not yet.

We?ll also dig into the open source Fn Project?s unparalleled Java support which makes it possible to build, test, and scale out Java-based functions applications.'
