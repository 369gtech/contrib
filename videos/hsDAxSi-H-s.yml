The training data consist of a set of training examples. In supervised learning, each example is a pair consisting of an input object (typically a vector) and a desired output value (also called the supervisory signal).\n\nTopics covered in the video are:\n1. Supervised Learning – Process Flow\n2. Understanding Variables\n3. Target variable output\n\nRelated blogs:\nhttp://www.edureka.co/blog/application-of-clustering-in-data-science-using-real-life-examples/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=supervised-learning\nhttp://www.edureka.co/blog/who-can-take-up-a-data-science-tutorial/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=supervised-learning\nEdureka is a New Age e-learning platform that provides Instructor-Led Live, Online classes for learners who would prefer a hassle free and self paced learning environment, accessible from any part of the world.\nThe topics related to ‘Supervised Learning’ have been covered in our course ‘Data science’.\nFor more information, please write back to us at sales@edureka.co\nCall us at US: 1800 275 9730 (toll free) or India: +91-8880862004"
