description: "Refining Systems Data without Losing Fidelity\n\nLiz Fong-Jones, honeycomb.io\n\nIt is not feasible to run an observability infrastructure that is the same size as your production infrastructure. Past a certain scale, the cost to collect, process, and save every log entry, every event, and every trace that your systems generate dramatically outweighs the benefits. If your SLO is 99.95%, then you'll be naively collecting 2,000 times as much data about requests that satisfied your SLI than those that burnt error budget. How do you scale back the flood of data without losing the crucial information your engineering team needs to troubleshoot and understand your system's production behaviors?\n\nStatistics can come to our rescue, enabling us to gather accurate, specific, and error-bounded data on our services' top-level performance and inner workings. We can keep the context of the anomalous data flows and cases in our supported services while not allowing the volume of ordinary data to drown it out.\n\nView the full SREcon19 Europe/Middle East/Africa Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon19emea/program \n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
