description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2015\nSpeaker:  Dustin Whittle, AppDynamics\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/modern-frontend-engineering\nThe web has evolved tremendously in the last decade. In this talk we will dive into the latest tools and techniques that make for a modern foundation for frontend engineering. We will start with bootstrapping with Yeoman, move into managing dependencies with bower, and finally how to automate best practices with Grunt and Gulp. We will discuss the pros and cons of modern ui toolkits like Zurb, Bootstrap, and SemanticUI and modern javascript frameworks like React, Angular, and Ember. We will highlight the latest in css frameworks, javascript frameworks, and why you should choose the right toolset for complex app or a single page app. When you leave this session you will be prepared to launch a modern web application in 2015."
