description: "Diversity is the magic ingredient of building successful teams\nThere is definitely a magic with diverse teams. It is the secret sauce for high performing, harmonious teams. But diversity sits on a very thin edge. If\nunmanaged, diversity can create teams with seemingly irreconcilable differences, to a point of high toxicity and dysfunction.\n\nIn this talk we will share our experiences of working in a multi-cultural society of extremes. We will share the tough lessons that we learned and present what we do to harness the power and magic of diverse teams.\n\nSpeakers\nTania van Wyk de Vries founder and CEO of Infoware Studios. Tania has created an agile, high-energy and fun software development studio based in Johannesburg, is established as an innovator and entrepreneur, and lean startup sector in South Africa.\n\nAslam Khan is an African software developer, by birth, by choice and for life.  He believes that all of software is just design and values code as an expression of design. The same goes for architecture - it's all design. The one thing he has learnt is that design is hard, very hard, because achieving a harmonious balance is difficult. Thatâ€™s the challenge - finding an equilibrium in all that we do."
