title: 'Reactive Relational Database Connectivity by Ben Hale'
language: English
recordingDate: 1557993315
description: 'As more and more projects start incorporating reactive programming, they begin to discover that the only way to get the full benefit of that change is to ensure that they have a fully reactive stack. There are a number of messaging systems and data stores that enable this fully reactive stack, but there has been a big piece missing when it comes to accessing relational database systems in a fully reactive way. This talk presents the Reactive Relational Database Connectivity (R2DBC) project. The project is an effort to design a reactive API for accessing a relational database access. This talk will explain how the API works, the benefits of using it, and how it contrasts with other projects in the same space.'
