description: "Working with Google App Engine Models\r\nRafe Kaplan (Google)\r\n\r\nGoogle App Engine Datastore Models have a lot in common with existing frameworks such as ActiveRecord and the Django database API. However, there are significant differences because of how the App Engine Datastore works. This talk will introduce the App Engine Model Framework and show how to use it to represent real-world information. Learn about the various types of information you can store using the Model and how to create relationships between entities. Beyond the basics, you can learn how to extend the model to store custom data types. In the course of this demonstration, we will build a model to represent a common and practical use case - User preferences."
