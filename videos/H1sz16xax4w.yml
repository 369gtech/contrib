description: "We help you learn to code, then practice by building projects for nonprofits. Learn Full-stack JavaScript, build a portfolio, and get a coding job by joining our open source community at http://freecodecamp.com\n\nFollow Quincy on Quora: http://www.quora.com/Quincy-Larson\n\nFollow us on Twitch: twitch.tv/freecodecamp\n\nFollow us on twitter: https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=freecodecamp\n\nLike us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/freecodecamp\n\nStar us on GitHub: https://github.com/freecodecamp/freecodecamp\n\nWe'll build this Waypoint on Cloud 9, a powerful online code editor with a full Ubuntu Linux workspace, all running in the cloud.\n\nIf you don't already have Cloud 9 account, create one now at http://c9.io.\n\nOpen up http://c9.io and sign in to your account.\n\nClick on Create New Workspace at the top right of the c9.io page, then click on the \"Create a new workspace\" popup that appears below it the button after you click on it.\n\nGive your workspace a name.\n\nChoose Node.js in the selection area below the name field.\n\nClick the Create button. Then click into your new workspace.\n\nIn the lower right hand corner you should see a terminal window. In this window use the following commands. You don't need to know what these mean at this point.\n\nInstall scope-chains-closures with this command: npm install -g scope-chains-closures\n\nNow start the tutorial by running scope-chains-closures.\n\nNote that you can resize the c9.io's windows by dragging their borders.\n\nMake sure that you are always in your project's \"workspace\" directory. You can always navigate back to this directory by running this command: cd ~/workspace.\n\nYou can view this Node School module's source code on GitHub at https://github.com/jesstelford/scope-chains-closures.\n\nComplete \"Scopes\"\n\nComplete \"Scope Chains\"\n\nComplete \"Global Scope and Shadowing\"\n\nComplete \"Closures\"\n\nComplete \"Garbage Collection\"\n\nOnce you've completed these steps, move on to our next challenge."
