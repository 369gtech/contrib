description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2017\n—\nFor the past several years, I have been researching new languages to support safe and efficient network protocol processing, specifically for software-defined networking applications. The unfortunate outcome of that research is this conclusion: any language for that domain must also be a general purpose programming language. This is not an easy thing to do. Many of the language features I worked with simply generated expressions to compute packet and header lengths, read and write packet fields, and encode and decode entire packets. If we could do this in C++, I might not need an entirely new language. \n\nOver the past year, Herb Sutter and I have collaborated to work on language support for compile-time programming, static reflection, metaclasses, and code generation in the C++ programming language. These facilities completely eliminate the need for the external tools, metacompilers, and domain-specific languages on which we frequently rely to generate high-performance encoders and decoders in C++. \n\nIn this talk, I will discuss how to use these evolving proposals to create facilities for encoding and decoding packets. In particular, I will discuss the background requirements of my work, the overall design of a network protocol library, and the reflection and generation facilities that implement the library.\n— \nAndrew Sutton: The University of Akron, Assistant Professor\n\nAndrew Sutton is an assistant professor at the University of Akron in Ohio where he teaches and conducts research at the intersection of Software Engineering and Programming Languages. Dr. Sutton helped design and implemented the Concepts Lite proposal for the C++ programming language. He is also the author of the Origin C++ Libraries, an experimental collection of generic libraries that supports ideas and research for generic programming. Dr. Sutton had previously worked as a postdoctoral researcher at Texas A&M University where he worked with Bjarne Stroustrup and Gabriel Dos Reis on the design and implementation of language support for generic programming (i.e., Concepts Lite). He is a member of the C++ Standards Committee and Project Editor for the Concepts Lite Technical Specification. He graduated with a PhD in computer science from Kent State University in Ohio in 2010.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
