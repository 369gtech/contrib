description: "by Tomislav Jovanovic\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/UD2.208/global_consent_manager.webm\n\n\nGlobal Consent Manager project is a collaboration between Mozilla, University of Missouri and University of Nebraska Omaha.  The result is a browser extension prototype that helps with managing of GDPR cookies and consent dialogs across trusted websites. Description of how consent management on the web works today, and the relationship between user privacy and reputable content providers.  Web users face a confusing array of data sharing choices, and click fatigue can lead to poor user experience and possible inadvertent selection of options that do not match the userâ€™s privacy norms.  Reputable content providers face revenue disruption arising from changing data privacy regulations. \n\nIn this session, we will discuss how to improve the consent experience.  New standards for user control of data sharing present an opportunity for sites trusted by users to work together with browsers to implement data sharing choices that provide a better experience and a more accurate reflection of the user's privacy preferences. \n\nRoom: UD2.208 (Decroly)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 12:30:00+01"
