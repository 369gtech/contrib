Today we can profit from the vast quantities of data that our institutions generate. Yet with these new capabilities come risks. Data can be abused. As a society, we now begin the process of deciding how to limit this new power. The policies and practices we develop in the next few years will set the stage for the coming century. In this presentation Doug Cutting, Cloudera’s Chief Architect, will discuss how we might both reap the benefits of data while avoiding its perils.\n\nAbout Doug Cutting (Cloudera):\nDoug (@cutting) is the founder of numerous successful open source projects, including Lucene, Nutch, Avro, and Hadoop. Doug joined Cloudera in 2009 from Yahoo!, where he was a key member of the team that built and deployed a production Hadoop storage and analysis cluster for mission-critical business analytics. Doug holds a Bachelor’s degree from Stanford University and sits on the Board of the Apache Software Foundation.\n\nStay Connected to O'Reilly Media by Email - http://goo.gl/YZSWbO\nFollow O'Reilly Media:\nhttp://plus.google.com/+oreillymedia\nhttps://www.facebook.com/OReilly\nhttps://twitter.com/OReillyMedia"
