description: "Rapid scaling can't be done without unexpected outages.  Dave Cliffe from PagerDuty describes best practices when issues arise and how to manage incidents while bringing services back online.\n\nBest Practices for When s*IT Hits the Fan\n\nDave Cliffe, PagerDuty\n\nOutages suck; how you handle them shouldnâ€™t. At PagerDuty, we talk to real customers experiencing real outages all the time. Operations escalations and downtime can be handled in many ways:\n\nDuring the incident: who to alert when, how to communicate, handling dependency and downstream failures, disclosure\n\nAfter the incident: post-mortems, public disclosure, formalizing process vs. investing in automation, preventative actions\n\nThere are also ways to keep engineers sane, customers happy, and the $$$ flowing. In this talk, come learn about best practices from across the industry, including how PagerDuty executes during an outage (but trust us, those never happen).\n\nView the full LISA14 Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa14/conference-program"
