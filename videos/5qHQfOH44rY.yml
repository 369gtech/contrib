title: 'Bring the Light into Your Always FREE Autonomous Cloud - Dimitri Gielis'
language: English
recordingDate: 1587394327
description: "At Oracle Open World 2019, the always FREE Autonomous Cloud was announced. Shortly after that, I did a popular series of blog posts (https://dgielis.blogspot.com/2019/09/best-and-cheapest-oracle-apex-hosting.html). This presentation will build further upon on this series. While the blog posts explain how to set things up, in this presentation I want to give tips and tricks for using the cloud, such as how to move your apps to and from the cloud, how to use advanced compression and how to measure performance and up-time.  After this presentation, the attendees have all the info they need to be successful in running their applications in the Always FREE Autonomous Cloud.\n\n\nA recording provided by the awesome APEX community, that built a virtual 24 hour conference called APEX@Home held on April 16th 2019.\n\nWith 24 world renowned speakers and nearly 5000 virtual attendees, this event was a huge success.
