How does it manage to run for so long on machines with such little memory and still have such good soft-real time performance? This talk explores the answer by looking at the basics of how the BEAM handles memory in processes and a bit about its very special garbage collection algorithm.\n\n-- Read the full abstract: http://bit.ly/2RFerJZ\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - DEVON ESTES\nMaintainer of Benchee & Elixir track on exercism.io at \n\nDevon is a freelance software engineer focusing on Ruby and Elixir.
