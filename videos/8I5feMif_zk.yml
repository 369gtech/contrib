title: 'DEF CON Safe Mode AppSec Village - Christian Schneider - Threagile   Agile Threat Modeling'
language: English
recordingDate: 1598227873
description: 'The open-source tool Threagile enables agile teams to create a threat model directly from within the IDE using a declarative approach: Given information about the data assets, technical assets, communication links, and trust boundaries as input in a simple to maintain YAML file, it executes a set of over 40 built-in risk rules, which can be extended with custom risk rules, against the processed model. The resulting artifacts are graphical diagrams, Excel, and PDF reports about the identified risks, their rating, and the mitigation steps as well as risk tracking state. DevSecOps pipelines can be enriched with Threagile as well to process the JSON output.'
