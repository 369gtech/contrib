description: "This session explores IDE tooling for JavaScript development. Which of the big three Java IDEs (IntelliJ, Eclipse, NetBeans) provide the best integration with the JavaScript ecosystem. A good code editor with the latest support for ECMAScript 6 is only part of the equation. You need support for JavaScript build tools like Grunt as well as unit testing frameworks and runners and browser integration. This presentation will look at all aspects – web, mobile, and server-side JavaScript development.\n\nRyan Cuprak is an CPG & Retail, Formulation R&D Development Senior Manager at Dassault Systemes, co-author EJB in Action 2nd Edition from Manning and the NetBeans Certification Guide from McGrall-Hill.

At Dassault Systemes he works on the ENOVIA Enginuity chemical formulation software and is involved in desktop and backend server development as well as client data migrations.
