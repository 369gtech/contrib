description: "by Lo√Øc Hoguin\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/AW1.121/beam_farwest_demo.webm\n\nFarwest is an Erlang framework for building RESTful Web applications and APIs.\n\n\nWell written Farwest applications apply the HATEOAS principles and as a result can be interacted with using a single client. This removes entirely the need to write a separate client per API and lets servers decide how the data is best consumed by everyone.\n\n\nThis demo will show how to use Farwest to write a simple API to a document oriented database.\n\nRoom: AW1.121\nScheduled start: 2020-02-01 09:30:00"
