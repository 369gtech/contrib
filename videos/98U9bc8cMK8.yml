title: 'Taking the Application Server to Web Scale with Netflix Open Source Software'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433254192
description: "This session looks at how to simplify the creation of resilient and scalable applications by using Netflix open source software with an extensible Java EE application server. The open source projects made available via Netflix provide the basis for creating a microservices architecture that is highly scalable and tolerant of faults and latency issues. The presentation provides guidance on how to get started with a core set of these projects (Archaius, Hystrix, Eureka, Ribbon, and Karyon) in the context of a Java EE application and how an extensible OSGi runtime such as IBM WebSphere Application Server Liberty Profile can package these for easy consumption.\n\n\nAuthor:\nDavid Currie\nDavid is a Senior Software Engineer at IBM currently working on the development of IBM WebSphere Application Server at IBM's Hursley Laboratory in the UK. His areas of responsibility are diverse including integration with Cloud Foundry PaaS, support for Context and Dependency Injection, and ecosystem work with Netflix Open Source Software. In previous roles he has worked on the development of IBM API Management, WebSphere Appliance Management Center and WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus, and spent five years working in the field with IBM clients across Europe. He is passionate about the use of agile practices and the application of software craftmanship.\nView more trainings by David Currie at https://www.parleys.com/author/david-currie-1\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
