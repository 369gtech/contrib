description: "Welcome to Fresh Machine Learning! This is my new course dedicated to making bleeding edge machine learning accessible to developers everywhere. \n\nThe demo code for this video is a handwritten character classifier in Python using a One-Shot Learning technique with SciPy: \n\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/One-Shot-Learning-Demo\n\nI created a Slack channel for us, sign up here:\nhttps://wizards.herokuapp.com/\n\nI introduce two papers in this video\n\nHuman Level Concept Learning through Probabilistic Program Induction:\n\nhttp://web.mit.edu/cocosci/Papers/Science-2015-Lake-1332-8.pdf\n\nand it's associated code is in MatLab:\n\nhttps://github.com/brendenlake/BPL\n\nbut Matlab requires $ to download and Python is better suited for building production apps. I found a great alternative though, these guys are really close to finishing this python library. It's called 'PyBPL' they are working on making the results from the paper generalized so that you can apply BPL to any kind of example dataset. I talked with the lead dev and he said they'd have working demos out in 3-6 weeks so follow this repo!!:\n\nhttps://github.com/MaxwellRebo/PyBPL\n\nOne-Shot Learning with Memory Augmented Neural Networks:\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.06065v1.pdf\n\nand it's associated code is here:\n\nhttps://github.com/tristandeleu/ntm-one-shot\n\nAlso, here's another very recent One Shot Learning Paper from DeepMind that I couldn't squeeze into this video but is very interesting:\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.04080v1.pdf\n\nI love you guys! Thanks for watching my videos, I do it for you. I left my awesome job at Twilio and I'm doing this full time now. \n\nI recently created a Patreon page. If you like my videos, feel free to help support my effort here!:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/user?ty=h&u=3191693\n\nMuch more to come so please subscribe, like, and comment.\nFollow me:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/sirajraval\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/sirajology Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/sirajraval/ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/sirajraval/"
