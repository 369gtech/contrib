language: English
recordingDate: 1519801083
description: "With the constant change in the JavaScript ecosystem, it's often difficult to decide what is the best approach for building an application that meets the needs at the enterprise level. This session will present multiple concepts and ideas related to how JavaScript can be used on the client in a client-server architecture. What does it mean to move from a server-side language to a pure client-side language like JavaScript running in the browser? Is it just the language that changes or does the complete application architecture have to change as well? These questions, as well as what pitfalls to avoid, what techniques can be used to find that needle in the haystack, will all be discussed and answered in this session.\n\nhttps://developer.oracle.com/\nhttps://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/tryit"
