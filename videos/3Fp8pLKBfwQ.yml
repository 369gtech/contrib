Author and educator Emma Jane Hogbin Westby takes an unconventional approach to teaching version control with Git. Rather than start with the commands you’ll be running, she first explains why—and then demonstrates how.\n\nAlong the way, you’ll learn several Git hacks to help you be more efficient. And that means navigating Git from the command line. Many people prefer the “convenience” of a GUI, but in the long run, learning commands is quicker and easier than clicking various buttons on a succession of screens.\n\n• Create a visual map of Git by sketching your own diagrams \n• Use an example project to get started with hosted Git repositories \n• Learn how to upload changes and merge work with branches \n• Work with tags to pinpoint specific commits in the history of your work \n• Find and fix bugs by comparing “working” and “non-working” states\n• Learn how to undo your work with rollbacks and resets\n• Clean up your commit history with rebase\n• Move your sample project from GitLab to GitHub\n• Learn how to collaborate on GitHub and BitBucket\n\nEmma Jane Hogbin Westby has been working as a web developer since 1996 and has been participating in FOSS communities for over a decade. Having written two Drupal books, including Front End Drupal (Prentice Hall), she has been teaching web-based technologies online and in person for over a decade.  \n\n\nDon't miss an upload!
