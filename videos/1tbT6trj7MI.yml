description: "How current megatrends are changing the Big Data landscape and what it means to us\n\nAlthough Big Data has been always evolving fast, today we see new megatrends that might revolutionize the Big Data landscape. They include containerization, hybrid and public cloud, stream processing, AL/ML to name a few. Will companies go to the cloud at some point? How Hadoop and open-source ecosystem will look like when Cloudera and Hortonworks merge together? What vendors will disrupt the Big Data industry? During this presentation, I will try to answer these questions and explain how we implement Big Data projects at GetInData to follow these megatrends. The presentation will also give some tips on how you can prepare for incoming changes and specific actions that you can also take in 2019.\n\nThe speech took on 8th May 2019 on DataTech Stage during Infoshare 2019.\n\n#Bigdata #Trends #DataTech #Tech"
