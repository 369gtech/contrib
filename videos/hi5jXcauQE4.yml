description: "Sponsored Keynote: Building a Bigger Tent: Cloud Native, Cultural Change and Complexity - Bob Quillin, VP Developer Relations, Oracle Cloud \n\nThe Cloud Native ecosystem continues to expand dramatically but many enterprises and traditional development teams are being left behind. The top two issues facing our industry are cultural change for developers and complexity â€“ thus we need to find ways to build a bigger cloud native tent that is more inclusive of modern and traditional applications, cloud and on-premises users. This keynote focuses on the challenges and opportunities to create a more inclusive, sustainable cloud native community. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MRz1"
