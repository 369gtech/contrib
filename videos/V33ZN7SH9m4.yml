description: "Using Envoy for data aware traffic routing in Azure Service Fabric - Vaclav Turecek, Microsoft\_\n\nLearn how Envoy is the key component in solving Service Fabric's unique data-aware traffic routing challenges. With co-located compute and state, service communication needs to be aware of data partitioning and replica placement in addition to the ingress, discovery, and networking challenges typically found in distributed applications and cloud-native architectures.\n \nWe'll show you how Envoy is being integrated into Service Fabric to abstract away the complexities of traffic routing and provide a language and platform agnostic service communication layer. As a bonus, we'll also show you how we made Envoy work on Windows."
