description: "We're going to create a visual grid of squares with obstacles in it. Then, we'll use computer vision and a path planning algorithm to find the optimal route from point A to point B in the grid. You'll need the OpenCV, scikit-image, and numpy libraries installed for python.\n\nPlease subscribe! and like and comment.
