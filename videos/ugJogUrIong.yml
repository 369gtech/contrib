title: 'Interview Prep Considered Harmful, with Zack Zlotnik'
language: English
recordingDate: 1597968086
description: "It is no secret that technical interviews are broken. However, instead of addressing the root problem, a cottage industry of interview preparation websites and services such as HackerRank, Leetcode, Interviewing.io, and others have sprung up which some feel are only making things worse. Interview candidates frequent interview prep sites and services looking to increase their chances of passing a technical interview. While being prepared for an interview is never a bad idea, some take preparation for the extreme, studying for weeks and even months in the most extreme cases. This talk aims to discuss some of the hidden issues this trend of cramming for technical interviews causes, why we do this, and ways we can fix these problems from outside as well as from within.\n\nZack Zlotnik presents.\n\nSlides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iaIWj8U4zY5CsgmtSlsSixo97_tnV2Mwj3yTZkePsBA/edit?usp=sharing"
