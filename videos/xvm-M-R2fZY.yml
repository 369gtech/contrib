description: "Speaker: Ben Ball\r\n\r\nAbstract: Python is becoming the de facto standard for many machine learning applications. We have been using Python with deep learning and other ML techniques, with a focus in prediction and exploitation in transactional markets. I am presenting one of our implementations (A dueling double DQN - a class of Reinforcement Learning algorithm) in Python using TensorFlow, along with information and background around the class of deep learning algorithm, and the application to financial markets we have employed. Attendees will learn how to implement a DQN using Tensorflow, and how to design a system for deep learning for solving a wide range of problems. The code will be available on github for attendees.\r\n\r\nBio: Ben is a believer in making a career out of what you love. He is inspired by the joining of excellent technology and research and likes building software that is easy to use, but does amazing things. His work has spanned 15 years, with a dual focus in AI Software Engineering and Algorithmic Trading. He is currently working as the CTO of http://prediction-machines.com \r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/Singapore-Python-User-Group/events/240925787/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/8XIs/"
