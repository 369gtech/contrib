description: "by Franklin Weng\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/UA2.114/server_side_solution_for_generating_odf_reports.webm\n\n\nThe National Development Council in Taiwan have asked the OSSII, a local LibreOffice service provider, to develop a solution that can directly generate ODF reports, while the servers in public administrations do not need to change a lot. To adopt ODF and LibreOffice in Taiwan, a very important part, besides desktop applications, is to ask the reports generated from servers in all the public administrations to be in ODF format.  Currently almost all reports are in Microsoft office format; some of them are even non-standard -- they can be opened by Microsoft Excel, but can not be converted by LibreOffice.  Hence, the National Development Council asked the OSSII, a local LibreOffice service provider, to develop a solution that can directly generate ODF reports, while the server side do not need to change a lot.  This talk gives a simple introduction of how this solution works. \n\nRoom: UA2.114 (Baudoux)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 11:00:00+01"
