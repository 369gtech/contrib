description: "In this talk we will be showing how Graph Nets (GNs)—a set of statistical models that directly operate on molecular topology by updating and aggregating information between atoms and bonds—can approximate per-atom, per-bond, and per-molecule properties derived by quantum mechanics (QM), with errors within the uncertainty thereof, and an over-500-fold speed up\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
