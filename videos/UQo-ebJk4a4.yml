description: "\"Static typing: beyond the basics of def foo(x: int) -str:\n[EuroPython 2019 - Talk - 2019-07-10 - Boston]\n[Basel, CH]\n\nBy Vita Smid\n\nThe Python community has been warming up to static typing for a few years now. You may have seen talks that did a great job of introducing the basic concepts, mypy, and high-level strategies to cover existing code bases.\n\nWe need to go deeper.\n\nLet’s talk about the challenges you inevitably encounter when you try to type-check a large code base. One full of many moving parts, complex architectures, metaprogramming tricks, and interfaces with a dozen other packages.\n\nStatic type checking is very powerful – when you use it to maximum advantage and explain your code to the typechecker accurately. We will cover a few tools at your disposal: generics, signature overloads, protocols, custom mypy plug-ins, and more.\n\nThere is more than just tools, though. Behind them all are universal concepts valid in any language. I hope to convince you that thinking in terms of the type system helps you write better code…\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2019.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/"
