description: "In this session, I'll talk about how to understand your customers - how they're behaving, how capable they are of learning and changing, how they make decisions, what they care enough about to pay money or attention to fix.\n\nIt's not easy. Most of you have probably gotten feature requests, built them, only to find that your customers still weren't happy. Why? Because humans are terrible at expressing what they want. Blame cognitive biases (and learn how to counteract them).\n\nWe'll talk about how to outsmart your brain and decode what your customers want through asking smart questions and listening well.\n\nKey takeaways\nUnderstanding how your future customers decide to use (or not use) your product\nSpotting the cognitive biases that drive us away from the best product decisions\nHow to ask effective -non-biased questions of your teammates and your future customers\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
