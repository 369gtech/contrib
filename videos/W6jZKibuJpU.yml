Using EH effectively can produce code that is simpler, more readable, and more robust than you can get with alternative mechanisms. In this session, we will explain the purpose of EH by contrasting it with the most common alternative, function return codes. We will show you the preferred techniques for throwing and catching exceptions, including which types of objects to throw, when to throw them, and how to catch them. We will describe the different levels of exception safety guarantees and demonstrate techniques like RAII that will help you write functions that provide those guarantees. We will illustrate how to write exception-neutral code that allows you to use EH without creating additional failure points.\n— \nBen Saks\nChief Engineer, Saks & Associates\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
