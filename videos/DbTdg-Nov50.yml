description: "Sequence Diagrams Here: http://goo.gl/LIwGO\n\nIn the last tutorial, I showed you how to create a complicated sequence diagram for our ATM software. In this tutorial, I'm going to simulate the process of creating a sequence diagram in a group atmosphere.\n\nI'll improve the last design, while explaining what I'm thinking. I'm also trying to teach how to think through a programming problem while creating the sequence diagram."
