title: 'Explainable causal inference results - Thomas Nägele | PyData Eindhoven 2021'
language: English
recordingDate: 1638995329
description: "A Bayesian network is a graph representation of a joint probability distribution over a number of variables of interest. Once instantiated with prior probabilities and observations, the inference algorithm updates all probabilities for all variables, i.e., nodes in the graph. In large networks it is difficult to understand what observations are relevant for the inferred probability of a node of interest. To come to the set of observations relevant to a node of interest, we compute an extended Markov Blanket for this node. This approach provides to the user a subgraph with only the relevant observations, and, therefore, supporting the explanation over the inferred probabilities.\nThe talk consists of 1) an introduction into Bayesian networks and some of the available BN Python libraries, 2) a description of our method to make the inference results more explainable, and 3) some examples, both showing the method’s capabilities and limitations. The talk does not require any prior knowledge, but a rough understanding of probability theory and graphs could help. After the talk, the audience will be familiar with Bayesian networks and how these can be scoped based on relevance.\n\nThomas Nägele: a research fellow at ESI (TNO) in Eindhoven. His focus is on the development of model-based methodologies for system-level diagnostics of high-tech systems. His main interests are model-based methodologies, model simulation and multi-model methods such as co-simulation. He received his BSc, MSc and PhD degrees in Computing Science from the Radboud University in Nijmegen.\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-n%C3%A4gele/\nWebsite: https://thomasnagele.nl/\n\nPyData Eindhoven 2021\nWebsite: https://pydata.org/eindhoven2021/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pydataeindhoven\n\n===\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
