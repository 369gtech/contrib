In the past, companies would cludge together these tool conglomerations to get a process that worked for them. Individual developers, on the other hand, typically did everything with a minimal set of tools and a lot of manual processes. In this video, I am going to introduce you to a tool that changes all of that for both individuals and companies. It is called Azure DevOps. The best part is that, unless you are an organization with more than five developers or are making more than a million dollars in revenue each year, this product is free to use."
