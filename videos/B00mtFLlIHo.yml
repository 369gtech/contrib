description: "The easy part is understanding what Agile is about. The hard part is making change happen in practice. To change organizations you need to change people. To change people you need to start with the only person you have any control over - yourself.\n\nIn this talk Henrik will use real-life examples to help you understand what you can do to trigger organizational change and help your company become more agile"
