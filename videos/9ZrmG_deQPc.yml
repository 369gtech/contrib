description: "From Solid Conference 2015: Kickstarter projects often go on to incredibly bright stages. GRAMMY and Oscar wins. Acquisitions by Logitech, Samsung, and Facebook. Showcases at MoMA and TED. Trips to outer space. And far beyond. It’s a privilege to be the go-to place for some of the world’s most inspired and ambitious creative projects, and with that privilege comes the responsibility to create a trusted system and uphold its integrity. Over the years how has Kickstarter designed checks and balances to accomplish that, while valuing all sides of this new marketplace of ideas? What principles drive Kickstarter’s community governance? And, what’s next?\n\nAbout Yancey Strickler (Kickstarter):\nYancey Strickler is co-founder and CEO of Kickstarter. Yancey served as Kickstarter’s head of community and head of communications before becoming CEO.
