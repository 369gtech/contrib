description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2012\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nMartin Thompson - High-Performance Computing Specialist\n\nABSTRACT\nI this session we will attempt to bust the \"myth\" that computer hardware has become so complicated that no average developer could possibly understand the platform on which their software is executing. Martin believes it is possible for the modern developer to sufficiently understand our platforms to the same extent that a racing driver can understand the mechanics of their racing cars.\n\nThis session will cover CPUs, memory, networking and storage IO. The attendees will get the opportunity to understand how these work and what considerations they can apply to have their software performing like a race car rather than a bumper car. You get the chance to see if this myth can be busted.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
