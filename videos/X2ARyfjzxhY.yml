title: 'DEF CON Safe Mode Wireless Village  - FreqyXin - The Basics Of Breaking BLE v3'
language: English
recordingDate: 1597440011
description: 'Evolving over the past twenty-two years, Bluetooth, especially Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), has become the ubiquitous backbone modern devices use to perform low energy communications. From mobile, to IoT, to Auto, most smart devices now support Bluetooth connections, meaning that the attack vector is becoming an increasingly important aspect of security testing. This talk will breakdown the various phases of testing Bluetooth devices with an emphasis on sniffing BLE connections, spoofing devices, and exploiting GATT services. We will cover key components of the Bluetooth protocol stack, and the tools required to start testing BLE in your home, or as part of a Bluetooth pentest. This talk will also demonstrate that all you need to start testing BLE is an Android or iOS device, and a bit of curiosity.'
