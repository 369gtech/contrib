description: "Lilly Ryan\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/250/\n\nIf you’ve ever wanted an invisibility cloak, this talk is for you.\r\n\r\nCameras peer at us from street corners, from phones, from the dashes of passing cars, and from shopping mall advertisements. Even when you’re not posing for a selfie, you might end up in the background of someone else’s picture while you’re out at dinner — and if that photograph is uploaded to a social media site, facial recognition can pick you out of the lineup.\r\n\r\nMachines are getting better at recognising our faces — but if you want to sneak through the streets of your city like a young wizard in the corridors after midnight, there is still hope.\r\n\r\nThis talk provides an overview of the latest urban camouflage technology and how to deploy it in order to foil facial recognition. During this session you’ll learn the ways machines “see” us, and how to play with them in order to become invisible. We’ll dive into the ethics of biometric identification, the way current legislation affects this technology, and what is needed for facial recognition technology to be both useful and just.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
