recordingDate: 1542708858
description: "Software development is a process comprised of decisions made by the developers. But despite the fact that some decisions can have a long-lasting, crippling effects on our app, we base some of our choices on guesses.\nBut what if the best decision is indecision in favour of meticulous consideration? What if you could postpone most of your decisions until you gather enough facts to make the optimal one?\nIn this talk, Boris explains why, in his opinion, deferring decisions can result in a much better, simpler code base. He shows examples of the decisions that we think we have to make on day 1 of the project, yet they can and should be postponed. He also shows how practices like Spikes and the right design of your application allows that to happen.\n\nBoris is a Tech Lead at Wix, working on products that empower over 130 million websites. During his career, Boris got a chance to work in various companies – from a garage-stage startup to a colossal corporate environment. Boris believes that the code quality of a given product, has a direct impact on its external quality – the business value that the product gives management and its owner. Because of that and more, Boris has an immense passion for well-written, highly maintainable and well-tested code."
