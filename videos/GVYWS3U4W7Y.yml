description: "From #Vilnius to #Mallorca! BUILD STUFF is going to celebrate summer! An amazing weekend on APRIL 29-30, 2017 – MALLORCA, SPAIN will take you out of the office into a seaside event full of professional lectures, technical sessions, beach games, umbrella drinks, and wonderful sunset. #buildstuffes #beachconference #code www.buildstuff.es\n\nDavid Laribee is a product development coach with deep roots in Lean, Agile, XP and Scrum. He believes in the power of collaboration, simplicity and feedback.\\n\\nOver the last 20 years, David has built teams and products for companies of all shapes and sizes. He’s founded startups and consulted for Fortune 50 enterprises. He’s developed software-intensive products in a wide variety of domains from technology to insurance to beverage distribution to higher education. Prior to founding Nerd/Noir, David coached the product development team at VersionOne, a market leader in agile project management tools. David started work life at the early age of five on a farm in Upstate NY; an upbringing that accounts for his lead-from-the-front approach, appreciation for small/cross-disciplinary teams and disdain for fake maple syrup."
