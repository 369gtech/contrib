title: 'Tanzu Tuesdays - Making Kubernetes How We Build Things with Rob Richardson'
language: English
recordingDate: 1602022762
description: "It’s day 2. The corporate k8s cluster is humming. Everything works perfectly in a local environment, but how do you connect the wires? Your first few steps in Kubernetes may feel like walking through uncharted territory. Yet, several tools can make you just as productive as you were in your comfortable local setup. \n\nWith only a few changes in your configuration, you can automatically rebuild clusters when a file changes and even debug software running in containers. Add this to some visualization tools and some templating software, and you’ll be back on track very quickly. In this talk, you’ll learn how to use some open source tooling available around the Kubernetes ecosystem to become more productive and optimize for developer joy.\n\n---\n\nRob Richardson is a software craftsman building web properties in ASP.NET and Node, React and Vue. He’s a Microsoft MVP, published author, frequent speaker at conferences, user groups, and community events, and a diligent teacher and student of high quality software development. You can find this and other talks on https://robrich.org/presentations and follow him on twitter at @rob_rich."
