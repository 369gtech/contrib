But from a user’s perspective computers are often slower today than they were 30 years ago despite the enormous increase in measured performance of the hardware. How can this be? If this is true, what are we doing wrong and what can we do about it? Is efficiency an everyday concern for working programmers, or is it only needed for special cases written by specialists? \n\nIn this talk we will explore these questions and consider the proposition that, contrary to popular belief, performance almost always matters and pervasive attention to efficiency is essential to ensure good performance. We will examine the efficiency tools modern C++ has to offer and discuss techniques for writing efficient code in an elegant, expressive and natural way. Topics will include tuning vs. optimizing, value semantics vs. reference semantics, unions and variants, move semantics, forwarding, container choice, in-place construction, and container node handling. \n— \nAlan Talbot, LTK Engineering Services\nManager - Software Engineering\n\nAlan Talbot started programming in 1972, in BASIC on a DEC PDP-8. He began his professional programming career in 1979 and started using C++ in 1989. For 20 years he was a pioneer in music typography software, then spent 8 years writing digital mapping software, and has spent the last 9 years writing railroad simulation software. He has been a member of the C++ Standards Committee since 2005, and most of his Committee work has focused on improvements in efficiency. His contributions include container emplace, extract and merge of associative container nodes, and the emancipation of unions.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
