If you want to be sure that a program does the right thing in all possible situations, testing is not sufficient: only mathematical proof can cover an infinite state space. This talk introduces Isabelle/HOL, an interactive proof assistant (a kind of programming language and REPL for proofs), and explores how to formally verify distributed algorithms.\n\nSlides & full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/martin-kleppmann/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - MARTIN KLEPPMANN\nDistributed systems researcher and author\n\nDr Martin Kleppmann is a researcher in distributed systems at the University of Cambridge, and author of the acclaimed 'Designing Data-Intensive Applications' (O'Reilly Media, 2017). He mainly works on collaboration software, CRDTs, and formal verification of distributed algorithms. Previously he was a software engineer and entrepreneur at Internet companies including LinkedIn and Rapportive, where he worked on large-scale data infrastructure.\n\nMore on Martin Kleppmann: https://codesync.global/speaker/martin-kleppmann/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE MESH LDN 19\nCode Mesh LDN is powered by Code Sync.
