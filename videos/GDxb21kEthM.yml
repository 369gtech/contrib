description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2016\n—\nFacebook has open sourced Folly, its core C++ Library and the \nfoundation of all of Facebook's C++ code. Folly builds practical, \nefficient, and novel components on top of the standard library. \nFacebook engineer Dave Watson will do a deep dive on the core \ncomponents, and investigate how they have changed over time. We will \ncompare its design with previous talks and proposals, and highlight \ninsights learned from real-world usage in Facebook's large production \ncodebase. \n\nTopics include: \n* Singletons in a world with fork \n* Useful ThreadLocals \n* Pragmatic exceptions \n* Easy type conversions \n* Optimizing primitives, such as shared_mutex, vector, and atomic_shared_ptr\n— \nDavid Watson\nEngineer, Facebook\nDave Watson is an infrastructure engineer at Facebook. He has been focused on improving the application server stack, including improvements in RPC, load balancing, memory management, and asynchronous programming. He has contributed to many of Facebook's core services and OSS projects, including HHVM, folly, proxygen, wangle, and mcrouter. Previously he worked at F5 networks on load balancers and network monitoring tools.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
