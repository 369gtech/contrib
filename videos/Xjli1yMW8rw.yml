title: 'It’s a Multi-Cloud World, But What About The Data?'

description: "Slides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/its-a-multicloud-world-but-what-about-the-data/Pivotal/its-a-multicloud-world-but-what-about-the-data\nMany enterprise architectures are now moving beyond cloud-first strategies to multi-cloud strategies, whether it’s multiple Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) foundations on the same cloud infrastructure vendor or foundations spread across a private cloud datacenter and multiple public cloud vendors. This necessitates a careful consideration of data layer approaches, practices and technical solutions that enable multi-cloud. The data layer is usually the achilles heel of multi-cloud strategies. Pivotal Cloud Cache (PCC) solves this problem by keeping data stores in geographically separate PCF foundations in sync (eventually consistent). It does this through WAN replication. In this session, we’ll deep dive into multi-cloud, active-active capabilities by exploring PCC’s WAN replication feature, and other ‘cloud friendly’ features like high availability and disk persistence for storing mission critical data. We’ll cover several WAN replication design patterns and topologies that support active-active setups that achieve high availability. We’ll demo a microservices application deployed in an active-active setup across two PCF foundation, and show how PCC handles data replication as well as site failure scenarios.\n\nSpeakers\nPulkit Chandra\nProduct Manager, Pivotal\nNikhil Chandrappa\nPlatform Architect (Data), Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
