When users connect their handheld devices running Android 5.0 or higher to a compatible vehicle, the Auto user interface provides a car-optimized Android experience on the vehicle's screen. Wayne Piekarski will introduce Android Auto APIs that allow developers to enable their existing audio and messaging apps developed for phones and tablets to work in the car, without having to worry about vehicle-specific hardware differences.\n\nWatch more talks from Ubiquity Dev Summit here: https://goo.gl/FS9v3U\n\nSubscribe to the Google Developers channel at http://goo.gl/mQyv5L\n\nMusic by Terra Monk: http://terramonk.com/"
