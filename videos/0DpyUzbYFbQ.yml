description: "Microsoft supports and contributes to open source. It also works with many enterprises that, like Microsoft itself, view security as a primary concern. Striking the right balance between the control Microsoft needs and the flexibility it wants means finding (or creating) the right tool for the job.\n\nBecause the company believes in open technologies and customer choice, it expanded the scope of Azure Policy Controller to Kubernetes Policy Controller, then donated it to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation’s Open Policy Agent, where it was renamed Gatekeeper. Gatekeeper is a community-driven approach for enforcing policy on any Kubernetes cluster, with automatic enforcement ranging from authorization and admission control to data filtering. The contributor community includes Google, Red Hat, and Styra.\n\nLachlan Evenson and Bridget Kromhout discuss the journey to build Gatekeeper in the open and explain how the tool helped inform how an enterprise offering on Azure was built. You’ll learn how flexible and fine-grained control enables you to set the necessary guardrails while expressing policies consistently, no matter the language or service.\n\nWe create the most secure software when we collaborate in the open to ensure a broad base of community support. Join in for pragmatic tips on how to effectively contribute to and use open source tools.\n\nThis keynote is sponsored by Microsoft Azure.\n\nSubscribe to O'Reilly on YouTube: http://goo.gl/n3QSYi\n\nFollow O'Reilly on: \nTwitter: http://twitter.com/oreillymedia\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/OReilly\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/oreillymedia\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/8459/"
