title: 'YOW! Data 2020 - Karthik Ramasamy - Apache Pulsar: The Next Generation Messaging and Queuing System'
language: English
recordingDate: 1609291489
description: "Apache Pulsar is the next generation messaging and queuing system with unique design trade-offs driven by the need for scalability and durability. Its two layered architecture of separating message storage from serving led to an implementation that unifies the flexibility and the high-level constructs of messaging, queuing and light weight computing with the scalable properties of log storage systems. This allows Apache Pulsar to be dynamically scaled up or down without any downtime. Using Apache BookKeeper as the underlying data storage, Pulsar guarantees data consistency and durability while maintaining strict SLAs for throughput and latency. Furthermore, Apache Pulsar integrates Pulsar Functions, a lambda style framework to write serverless functions to natively process data immediately upon arrival. This serverless stream processing approach is ideal for lightweight processing tasks like filtering, data routing and transformations. In this talk, we will give an overview about Apache Pulsar and delve into its unique architecture on messaging, storage and serverless data processing. We will also describe how Apache Pulsar is deployed in use case scenarios and explain how end-to-end streaming applications are written using Pulsar.\n\nKarthik Ramasamy is a Senior Director of Engineering managing the Pulsar team at Splunk. Before Splunk, he was the co-founder and CEO of Streamlio that focused on building next generation event processing infrastructure using Apache Pulsar and led the acquisition of Streamlio by Splunk. Before Streamlio, he was the engineering manager and technical lead for real-time infrastructure at Twitter where he co-created Twitter Heron. Twitter Heron was open sourced and used by several companies. He has two decades of experience working with companies such as Teradata, Greenplum, and Juniper in their rapid growth stages building parallel databases, big data infrastructure, and networking. He co-founded Locomatix, a company that specializes in real-time streaming processing on Hadoop and Cassandra using SQL, which was acquired by Twitter. Karthik has a Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Wisconsin, Madison with a focus on big data and databases. During his college tenure several of the research projects he participated were later spun off as a company acquired by Teradata. Karthik is the author of several publications, patents, and a popular book \"Network Routing: Algorithms, Protocols and Architectures\".\n\nFor more information on YOW!
