language: English
recordingDate: 1630175471
description: "This tutorial will cover the basics of Rasa, an open source library for building chatbots, including how words are translated into machine learning features and how the next conversation turn is picked. Then we'll quickly build a simple bot together and answer audience questions.\n\nDr. Rachael Tatman is a senior developer advocate at Rasa, where she helps developers use open source software to build great conversational AI projects. Before that she was at Kaggle (part of Google) and doing a PhD in Linguistics. If you hear a dog in the background, his name is Benson.\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/rctatman\n\nPyData Jeddah\nWebsite: https://pydatajeddah.com/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PyDataJeddah\n\nPyData\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.
