description: "JavaScript has become important and ubiquitous. There are more people writing JavaScript than any other language.

He also discovered the JSON Data Interchange Format, the world’s most loved data format. And he works at Yahoo!\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
