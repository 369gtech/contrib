description: "Just imagine a huge sheet with hundreds of columns and rows. Now try to edit them, analyze and send particular information via Gmail, find addresses in Google Maps and create hundreds of events in Google Calendar, all based on the information from the sheet. Doesn't sound that easy anymore, does it? When it comes to advanced tasks, the built-in functions might not be sufficient and too much manual activity might be needed. Not an ideal scenario for developers. Luckily, there is another, more powerful way to process and edit the data using JavaScript. Diana Vysoka shows the audience how to solve all of these problems using this beautiful language in your Google apps! This session contains a lot of good information in slides as well as live coding.\n\nThe global dev community meets at WeAreDevelopers, an event dubbed by many as the “Woodstock of Developers”. The WeAreDevelopers World Congress 2018 brought together 8,000 techies from 70 countries for 72-hours of pure dev-fun.\n\nVisit the largest developer playground in Europe!\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/wearedevelopers\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/WeAreDevs\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/_wearedevelopers/\n\n#WeAreDevs\n\n©2018, WeAreDevelopers"
