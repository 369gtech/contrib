description: "Gaweł Mikołajczyk Igor Ivanov Daniil Yugoslavskiy\nDefending from advanced cyberattacks requires defenders to have a more agile approach and more flexible platforms and toolsets. Classic vendor lock-in solutions, lack of APIs, scalability and extensibility push security teams to design new technology stacks. Using famous APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) attack as a case study, we'll show live simulated cyberattack, incident detection and threat hunting techniques. We'll show how you can improve your own security analytics capabilities using openly available tools and platforms."
