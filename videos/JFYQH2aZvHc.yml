description: 'The Job of a developer has evolved strongly in the last 10 years, pushed by new requirements and new tools. Software Development Industry has now reached a sufficient level of maturity to engage into a new practice to manage source code quality while running projects : Continuous Inspection. This practice is supported by Sonar as Continuous Integration is supported by Hudson. Continuous Inspection enables developer to fight back the temptation of the seven deadly sins of the developer. Sonar enables to declare war to those sins.'
