Other sectors have seen how good faith hackers and researchers can help increase resilience and highlight vulnerability â€“ how best to do that in a highly regulated, safety critical industry like aerospace? Aerospace regulators have a key role in understanding risk and putting in place the legal frameworks and creating rules, regulations and best practice around good faith research, join us on a panel with the research community and aerospace regulators to chat about what where we are and what we need to do.'
