description: "You've heard about limiting WIP (Work-In-Progress) but how good are you at limiting red time? Red time is when you have compilation errors and/or failing tests. A growing group of practitioners have learned how to effectively reduce red time while test-driving and refactoring code. To understand how to limit red time, it helps to visualize it. In this talk, I will analyze live programming sessions using graphs that clearly visualize red time. You'll learn what programming processes help or hurt our ability to limit red time and you'll gain an appreciation for the visual cues that can help make you a better programmer and fellow member of the Limited Red Society.\n\nJoshua Kerievsky is founder of Industrial Logic, Inc., an early pioneer and expert in Extreme Programming (XP), author of the best-selling, Jolt Cola Award-winning book Refactoring to Patterns, thought leader behind Industrial XP, a state-of-the-art synthesis of XP and Agile Project Management and an innovator of Agile eLearning, which helps organizations \"Scale Agility Faster\". Joshua has over 20 years of experience in software development and loves coaching agile project communities, helping executives understand and manage technical debt, leading excellent workshops, and building software products (because it enables him to \"walk the agile talk\" as an entrepreneur, manager, customer and programmer).\n\nFor more on YOW!
