description: "Google Tech Talks\r\nJuly 24, 2008\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nFaculty Summit 2008 - Day 1\r\nGoogle Data - Mark Stahl & Jeff Fisher\r\nThis presentation will give an overview of the Atom Publishing Protocol, a simple but powerful way of publishing and interacting with data stored on the web. The Atom Publishing Protocol is used as the basis of the Google Data APIs, which provide programmatic access to several Google applications. We will demonstrate a simple example that uses a web application to crowdsource the semantic labeling of image content. Data is both retrieved and published via Data APIs. We will also show how to publish the results of this example as an AtomPub API, and discuss ways you can use AtomPub as the mechanism for sharing your own data.\r\n\r\nSpeaker: Mark Stahl\r\nSpeaker: Jeff Fisher"
