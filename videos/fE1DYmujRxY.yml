We can estimate which users are online by simply querying for any users who are online in the last 5 minutes. Depending on how accurate we want to be, we can adjust this window to be 1 minute or 15 minutes to be more or less accurate.\n\nNo matter what you do, you'll end up with an estimation here. The user could leave a tab open in their browser for 8 hours and they would be considered \"offline\" after 5 minutes.\n\nNext episode, we'll talk about using ActionCable and having a websocket provide realtime updates of user's online status."
