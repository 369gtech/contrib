description: "Slides and more info: http://www.codemesh.io/codemesh2015/amir-chaudhry\n\nWord of Unikernels is beginning to spread, especially the benefits around security and portability. One of the other benefits of unikernels is the speed at which they can be summoned into existence, to serve demand as it occurs. This will allow developers to make the most use of hardware resources while still providing a seamless experiences for end-users.\n\nThis talk will present a brief overview of how cloud computing looks today and how we got here. Then we'll cover the basics of unikernels and some of the implementations that are available to use today before looking at some specific demos. There will be plenty of time for questions!\n\nTalk objectives:\n\n- Provide background and overview of Unikernels\n\n- Give a hands-on demo to showcase a particular aspect of unikernels\n\n- Demonstrate the many ways to get started with this approach to programmable infrastructure\n\n- Allow enough time for audience participation/questions!\n\nTarget audience:\n\n- Anyone interested in where cloud computing is going. This includes people thinking of containers, orchestration, security.\n\n- Anyone interested in approaches that span both the cloud and embedded systems (e.g. IoT).\n\n\nAbout Amir\n\nAmir works at Unikernel Systems and was previously Programme Manager in the OCaml Labs group at the Cambridge Computer Laboratory. Most of his time is spent on open source efforts and he's a big fan of automation (testing, deployment, etc). He's previously been involved in a number of startups and has a diverse academic background with an MSci in Physics and a PhD in Neuroscience."
