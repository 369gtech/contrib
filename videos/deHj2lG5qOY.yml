title: 'Reinventing MVC pattern for web programming with F# - Krzysztof Cie≈õlak'
recordingDate: 1532341825
description: "The MVC pattern has been one of the most important architectural patterns for server-side web development - it has been implemented and popularized by frameworks like Ruby On Rail or ASP.NET MVC. However, this pattern was traditionally coupled with object-oriented programming. In the talk, I will show how to reinvent MVC pattern, and structure your web application in a functional language - F#.\nThe talk will cover some brief introduction to F# - modern functional programming language running on .Net platform, show how to model MVC layers using functional composition, and at the end show some examples of applying MVC pattern with Saturn - opinionated, web development framework for F# which implements the server-side, functional MVC pattern"
