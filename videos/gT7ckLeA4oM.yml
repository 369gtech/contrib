description: "Creating inclusive and accessible apps is easy using React Native! Javascript developers can have a working app on their phone in less than an hour. Join me to see a working demo of how to plan, develop, and test for accessibility in the mobile space.\n\nI will also be talking about resources and guidelines you can use and share with your organisation to develop apps for everyone - including what the bare minimum looks like to help you prioritise your requirements!\n\nLarene is a Senior Software Consultant at ThoughtWorks, a consulting company that strives to better humanity through technology. I work to inspire my clients to create inclusive, accessible software to help make the digital world a welcome place for everyone.\n\nFor more information on YOW!
