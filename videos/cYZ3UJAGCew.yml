description: "Note: Unfortunately due to an issue, the camera recording the speaker feed was not picked up during this session. We apologise for this. \n\nAs a Sr. iOS Developer that's been coding in Swift since Day 1, it would have once been said that loving Android would never have happened. I speak internationally on behalf of Swift, and I used to refer to Kotlin and Android as \"The Dark Side\". It wasn't until I actually tried out Kotlin that I can say that I'm OFFICIALLY wrong.\n\nThis talk dives into the many similarities between Swift and Kotlin and what you can and can't do with each that you can do in the other. With two communities divided, can there be one to unite them?\n\nRaised by llamas in the great state of Texas, Hector grew to be an avid couch potato who likes spending his precious couch time playing the Legend of Zelda or yelling at the TV whilst watching the latest TV show obsession. While he isn't sitting at home vegging out, blogging or working on KrakenDev.io, you can find him sitting at the office writing iOS & Android mobile applications for Twitter. With a particular penchant for great mobile UI/UX, Hector writes the code that makes the world go round."
