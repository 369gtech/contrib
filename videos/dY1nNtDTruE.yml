description: "PyData LA 2018 \n\nUnit Testing isn't just for traditional applications. Testing is useful in data applications as well, from testing assumptions about the underlying structure of information, to testing your knowledge of math libraries.\n\nIn this tutorial we'll showing you how to use pytest from scratch. By the end you'll know enough to be able to use it in your next project.\n\n---\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.
