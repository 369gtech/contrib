description: "In programming, debugging unfolds like the stages of grief, or perhaps the story of an international conflict - and it occupies a special place in the minds of programmers. In this talk I will discuss the meaning of debugging, and its relation to other kinds of problem-solving.\n\nThis spring over 9400 IT specialists took part in Code Europe, the largest programming conference in Poland! Follow our website for more details: https://www.codeeurope.pl/en The next edition of Code Europe is coming in December!"
