description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nKubernetes to serve a fraud detection model - Gabriela Souza de Melo, Legiti\n\nIn this talk, Gabriela will present how Legiti has used a Kubernetes cluster for serving a real-time fraud detection machine learning application. This application is the most crucial API in Legiti, being the main point of contact with their customers, and being reached in a critical moment by their customers: in the middle of the transaction processing flow, and while the end users are waiting to know if their transaction has been accepted and their order placed. By leveraging Kubernetes' scaling capabilities, Legiti has ensured a reliable server, capable of handling their customers' transaction peaks without degradation of model performance, response quality or latency. Kubernetes also makes it easy to have auto deployments that have no impact on production reliability, with easy ways to set up automated rollbacks based on CI/CD end to end tests results. Using Kubernetes' Python client and pod management and configurations available by Kubernetes, Legiti was able to incorporate business logic that requires for the applications to get restarted with simple Python scripts.\n\nPearson Henri, Co-founder & CTO of Legiti, will join for the live Q+A session following this talk!"
