description: "Frameworks exist because writing maintainable apps in vanilla JavaScript is hard. But frameworks aren’t free: downloading and parsing those extra bytes slows things up, just when your users are deciding whether to stick around.\n\nInstead of choosing between bulky frameworks and maintainability nightmares, what if we could tell the computer ‘here are the blueprints, now you write the code’? In this talk we’ll discover a new breed of tools, such as Svelte, that let you do exactly that.\n\nOMG JSConf EU is coming back in 2019 https://2019.jsconf.eu/"
