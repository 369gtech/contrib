In this presentation I will try to explain basic concepts and give you an intuitive approach to using different algorithms for different tasks. By the end of this presentation youâ€™ll know which category of algorithms is most suited for your problem.\n\nJoakim Lehn From Knowit\nJoakim is a technical team lead with the Nordic consultancy Knowit, currently digging deep into modernizing the sales and ticketing solutions for rail operators in Norway as well as creating a national travel planning service across all public transport modes. He is passionate about the possibilities of AI/machine learning and building an awesome team culture with his colleagues."
