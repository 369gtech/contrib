description: "This talk will describe the port of Erlang to RTEMS. RTEMS is a open-source hard-realtime operating system for small embedded systems. It is used in the aerospace industry flying on satellites and planetary probes - currently its also driving around on Mars and on the Gallileo Satellites. Porting Erlang to RTEMS opens the way to new application areas, like in the current use case a intelligent RFID system for Industry 4.0 and Internet of Things applications.\n\nTalk objectives: Give a short overview of RTEMS, describe the port of the Erlang VM and how it can be used.\n\nTarget audience: Erlang developers who want to get closer to the hardware. Embedded systems developers who want to add Erlang to their systems."
