description: "Sophia Parafina, Developer Relations Engineer, Docker\n\nMost large enterprises have huge application installed bases. Many have apps running in production that were written by people who have moved on to other projects, or even other companies. How do you bring older, critical apps into a new, modern containerized infrastructure? In this presentation, youâ€™ll learn the benefits of moving to a containerized infrastructure and how to easily migrate a Java EE application to Docker containers without changing any code. And then begin the process of modernizing it by replacing the JavaServer Faces client with a JavaScript client written in React."
