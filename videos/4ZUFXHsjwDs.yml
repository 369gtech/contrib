title: 'David Oswald - "Spilling the @INC"'
language: English
recordingDate: 1498186589
description: "@INC is typically just a list of paths whence modules are loaded. But that's not ALL it is. To misquote Lord Acton: Power corrupts. Absolute power is fun. Once we embrace the power (or dismiss our better judgement), manipulating @INC can be fairly useful. Let's have some fun exploring the power of @INC while trying not to stain ourselves.\n\n\nDavid is the organizer of Salt Lake City Perl Mongers, and co-organizer of the previous two YAPC::NA events. He is a past speaker at various Perl Mongers groups, OpenWest, SaintCON, and YAPC. He works at Endurance International Group / Bluehost in the Platform & Infrastructure group."
