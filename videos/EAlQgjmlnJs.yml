description: "Drupal 7 co-maintainer Angela Byron and core developer Jeff Eaton will provide information on what's new and cool in Drupal 7, the latest release of the open source content management platform. We'll cover the big changes for end users, site builders, developers, and designers alike, and also provide some tips on upgrades.\n\n Angela Byron, Director of Community Development at Acquia, is an Open Source evangelist who lives and breathes Drupal. She got her start as a Google Summer of Code student in 2005 and since then has completely immersed herself in the Drupal community. Her work includes core coding and patch review, creating and contributing modules and themes, testing and quality assurance efforts within the project, improving documentation, and providing user support on forums and IRC.\n\nAngela has lead Lullabot's collaboration on O'Reilly's first Drupal book, entitled Using Drupal. She is on the Board of Directors for the Drupal Association and helps drive community growth by leading initiatives to help get new contributors involved such as Drupal's participation in Google Summer of Code and Google's Highly Open Participation (GHOP) programs. She is a sought-after lecturer on many themes, especially the topics of women in Open Source and just about anything to do with Drupal. Angie is known as \"webchick\" on drupal.org.\n\n\nJeff Eaton has been building Internet and desktop software for over a decade. He's participated in projects ranging from web-portals for communities and nonprofits, to enterprise client-server applications for retail industries, to large-scale web applications for companies like Dow AgroSciences and the Chicago Board of Trade.\n\nIn 2005, he began developing solutions based on the open-source Drupal content management framework. In the years since, he's become a core developer for the Drupal project, specializing in architecture and API development. In his capacity as a consultant for Lullabot Consulting, LLC, he's helped plan and build the software infrastructure for Drupal sites including MTV UK's music portal, SonyBMG's artist site platform, and Fast Company's groundbreaking business networking site. Jeff is known as \"eaton\" on drupal.org."
