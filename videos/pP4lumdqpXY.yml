title: 'Building a Game Boy emulator in .NET Core! - David Whitney - NDC London 2021'
language: English
recordingDate: 1623665616
description: "A teardown of building and porting Game Boy emulators, written in cross-platform C# running in .NET Core.\n\nWe'll deal with how machine code really works, how it's translated to opcodes, and how real time emulation works, all in this hour-long deep dive into emulation in .NET.\n\nExpect to learn about low level emulation, software porting, building debuggers and why you should always do things for fun."
