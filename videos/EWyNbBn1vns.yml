The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nStitching a Service Mesh Across Hundreds of Discrete Networks - Jason Webb & Anil Attuluri, Intuit \n\nIntuit has experienced large growth in its microservices ecosystem over the last few years, which was primarily using a hub and spoke API Gateway for service communication. As the ecosystem expanded, the increased latency and data transfer costs became significant. To facilitate future growth efficiently, Intuit needed a better model. Moving to a distributed Service Mesh running on k8s to enable secure service-to-service communication was the solution. As Intuit was building a migration path for hundreds of services communicating across discrete networks, they faced a host of challenges. While developing a platform to provide end-to-end encryption, they defined a pattern for federated workload identities and learned to manage a federated set of mesh control planes. Jason and Anil will share these learnings and Admiral, a project they are open-sourcing that enabled the migration path. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UadU"
