title: 'Wix Engineering Podcast, episode 12: Platformization'
language: English
recordingDate: 1621327107
description: "Platformization is technical, high-level work. But that doesn’t mean any talented developer can learn it like they would, say, a programming language.\n\nIn fact, this kind of work is hardly about the technical details at all. When Dan Bar Shalom joined Wix, he became the second member of a two-man team. Together with his colleague Itai Chejanovsky, he had to organize an entire company of developers to work towards one, common goal - unifying code. This was not so much a job for a technician, but a distinctly human endeavor. It was about listening to developers, making their lives easier, and helping them work better together.\n\nIn this episode, we’ll learn what it’s like to work in platformization. But more so than that, we’ll learn how to work with developers. Platformization may be a niche line of work, but getting people to work together is crucial to any team, and any company."
