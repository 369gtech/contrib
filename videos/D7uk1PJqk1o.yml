description: "This talk will focus on the behavioral benefits of moving to a microservices architecture in an organization. The technical benefits (and disadvantages) are clear, but in this talk, I'll try to explain how microservices prove to make a bigger impact on the people in the organization, their workflow, their development lifecycle, and the overall joy of their craft. \n\nSpeaker: Oded Shopen, Sr. Platform Architect, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2019\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/microservices-are-for-humans-not-machines"
