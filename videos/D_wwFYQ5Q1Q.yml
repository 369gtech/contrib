description: "Blockchain is totally Cyberpunk. It lets users cut out corporations by directly interacting and trading over the web, building up anonymous reputation scores and swapping credit sticks in person. Simultaneously it enables corporations to prove the origins and logistics channels of their products, and automatically penalising each other for breaking corporate agreements.\n\nThis session will give an introductory overview of What the Blockchain is, how it works, then spends the bulk of the time covering use cases to help you understand just how this transformational technology will impact EVERYTHING in our connected lives. With a little bit of futurism thrown in."
