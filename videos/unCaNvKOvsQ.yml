He was the team leader for National Geographic's Red Sea, Great White Shark, and November '96 Killer Whale photo expeditions. Mr. Nachoum's photos and essays have appeared in more than 500 publications in North America, Europe, and Japan, including National Geographic magazine, Ocean Realm, Island, Outside, Rodale's Scuba Diving, Time, Life, The New York Times, Cond√© Nast Traveler, Le Figaro, Terra Sauvage, Airone, and Mondo Somerso.\n\nAmos Nachoum - photographerIn addition, his work has been included in the books The Living Ocean, Oceans, and The World of Nature. He has been profiled in television appearances on National Geographic Explorer (Sept. '97), the Today Show, and Good Morning America, as well as in People, Esquire, and Money magazines.\n\nIn 1988 he won Nikon's underwater photography contest and in 1993, the Communication Arts Award. He is currently an instructor on the Nikonos team of professional photographers and also conducts his own SLR and advanced u/w photo seminars.\n\nAfter spending three years circumnavigating the globe, Amos co-founded Israel's Marine National Park on the Red Sea. In 1978 he established La Mer Diving Seafari Inc, a New York-based adventure-travel company that brought North American divers to some of the most pristine and exotic underwater locations on the planet, from the Galapagos Islands to the Maldives, from Papua New Guinea to Madagascar and the Red Sea. In the course of directing these operations he has become an expert at working in partnership with foreign governments and companies to bring divers to some of the most beautiful and little-visited parts of the underwater realm, with preservation of the environment's integrity foremost in every encounter.\n\nAmos Nachoum - photographerSince 1992, Amos's efforts have been focused on professional commercial and editorial photography for such clients as the Israeli office of tourism, Saba Island, the governments of Australia, New Zealand, and Brazil, and large private clients ranging from Apple, IBM, and Microsoft to The Discovery Channel, Armani, the Walt Disney corporation, and Colombia Pictures.\n\nArising from the belief that private individuals should have access to the same sights as governments and large corporations, Amos has developed the cutting-edge adventure-travel program Big Animals Photography Expeditions specifically to provide opportunities to observe, photograph, and interact with the most imposing inhabitants of the sea, such as great white sharks, killer whales, sperm and humpback whales, dolphins, and more. Only through such observation and interaction, Amos Nachoum believes, can people learn to truly understand and respect some of the most impressive citizens of our water planet."
