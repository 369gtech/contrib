description: "General principles and my experience building one\n\nDavid Howlett\n\nSaturday 15th, 12:30 (Room D)\nA talk (25 minutes)\n\nThis talk will cover the standard techniques used to build chess playing programs including minimax, alpha-beta search, piece valuation, positional valuation, iterative deepening and transposition tables. This talk will assume a knowledge of python but no knowledge of chess or the existing literature on how to write chess engines.\n\nI became fascinated by this topic after taking part in a competition with my brothers to build the best chess program during the Christmas holidays 2016."
