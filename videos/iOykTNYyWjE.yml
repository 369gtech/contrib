title: 'DrupalCon Baltimore 2017: How we develop Organic Groups 8 after 2 years with Elm'
recordingDate: 1493214421
description: "In Gizra, we run an unusual stack that helps us reach blazing fast websites - Drupal 7 & 8 run our backends, Elm in the front, and most recently Yesod (a Haskell framework).\n\nThere's a certain mindset behind choosing these technologies - it's about \"correctness\"; making sure we can move quickly without breaking stuff. Drupal 8 fits in nicely with this mindset because it now provides us with three different methods to test our code: Unit tests, Kernel and Functional.\n\nWhile this session covers the Horizon session scope to \"explore emerging technologies that you and your clients are actively implementing\", it will also touch on other elements that are part of the correctness mindset, such as PHP, QA, communication with clients, and even price offers.\n\nWe've come to realize that the idea of correctness is a fundamental line directing to the vanishing point of better products and better delivery. In this session, I'll explain in depth about this mindset, and how you can get involved, for example, starting with the Drupal-Elm starterkit we've published.\n\nAttendees should be anyone curious about different programing paradigms, such as Functional programming, and also feel that there could be a better way and are in search of it. You don't need to have prior knowledge about Elm or Organic Groups.\n\nIn the end of the session, attendees will have another perspective on how projects can (and are) being built, and will have enough technical knowledge to start following that path as-well."
