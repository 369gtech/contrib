title: 'Let''s Hack my Tesla with Javascript LIVE'
language: English
recordingDate: 1607105431
description: "I just bought a Tesla Model 3 with Filecoin because my life is essentially the show \"Silicon Valley\", no matter where i live. It's the only car I've ever really wanted & the only car i would actually read the owner's manual for (i finished all 230+ pages on day 1). We have to hack this into this thing and build a useful machine learning app ourselves :D. Teslas are better thought of as robots than normal cars. They are computers on wheels, and the (unofficial) Tesla API gives us access to lots of streaming data. We're going to build a NodeJS web app that uses reinforcement learning (OpenAI Gym) + the Tesla API (TeslaJS) + real-time climate data (Weather API) to build our own version of real-time predictive temperature control. Think of this as an energy optimization problem. \n\nThis week there will be 3 winners.  I will chose 3 people who answered 3/3 questions correctly to each receive $175 in BTC/ETH/USDC. Everyone on earth is eligible. Start studying Javascript + ML + Tesla's Architecture (it's a robot) Will we be able to build something useful? Find out live, see you then! \n\nSubscribe for more educational videos! And like.
