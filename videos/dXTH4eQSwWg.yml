title: 'Fireside Chat #5: Do we need architects?'
language: English
recordingDate: 1625152699
description: "In this episode, our co-founders Sandro Mancuso and Mashooq Badar and Spain Managing Director José E. Rodríguez Huerta discuss the need for architects? Do we need them? How do we define architecture? What are the different types of architects? Can architectural decisions be done democratically or should they be centralised? Is there a hybrid approach? What are the different levels of architectural decisions and their respective impacts? Do developers have the skills to make different types of architectural decisions? What about context? Small organisation vs large organisation? Those are just some of the topics discussed in this episode.\n\nIf you would like us to discuss a topic, please let us know in the comments and we will do our best to address it in a future episode. Any topics around Agile, Software Craftsmanship, Extreme Programming, technical practices, thought leadership, architecture, management, team dynamics, or anything else related to technology or software projects are welcome. \n\nThe idea of the Fireside chat series is to record many informal conversations we normally have outside working hours. Topics are normally decided just before we start recording. Our objective is to have spontaneous conversations instead of something more structured or scripted. \n\nFor more information about Codurance, please visit our website: https://codurance.com/."
