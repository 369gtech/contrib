description: "Windows Server Containers for Application Runtime - Matthew Horan & Sunjay Bhatia, Pivotal\n\n The Garden Windows team has been hard at work extending the Cloud Foundry Application Runtime with support for Windows Server Containers. We'll be providing an update on our progress in implementing Windows Server Containers support, and discuss the architecture of this implementation. We'll assess the new file-system and network isolation provided by Windows Server Containers, and cover some of the differences between Windows Server 2012R2 \"containers\" and what's offered in Windows Server 2016. We'll discuss some future roadmap items like OCI image support and other features that have been unlocked by Microsoft's container implementation. Finally, we'll provide a demo of the Windows Server Containers functionality currently present in cf-deployment. \n\nAbout Sunjay Bhatia\nSunjay Bhatia is a software engineer on the Garden Windows team at Pivotal in New York City.\n\nAbout Matthew Horan\nMatthew Horan has spent over a decade developing Web applications. Before becoming a developer, he worked as a systems administrator at various startups and hosting providers. Having worked with just about every configuration management tool, and being a developer by trade, he was naturally drawn to Cloud Foundry. He has focused on .NET due to a desire to bring the best practices of the Cloud Foundry platform to a wider audience."
