description: "https://2019.jsconfbp.com/speakers/stephanie-nemeth\n\nI’m introvert. This can be bit unfortunate, when you are a person that enjoys spending a lot of their free time creating things bedazzled with LEDs… only to rarely wear them out in public. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nIn an effort to actually share my weird and wonderful creations with others, I decided create a wearable project that would force me to be sociable in order for it to reveal its magic. In this talk, I’ll share how I used machine learning with javascript and tiny computers to make “fashion” that is responsive to the people around you and the attention you are (or aren’t) receiving.\n\nStephanie is a developer living in Berlin. She enjoys experimenting with hardware and LEDs to make beautiful, useless things."
