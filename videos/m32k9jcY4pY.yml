language: English
recordingDate: 1617225483
description: "PyData Helsinki Online Meetup\n\nMLOps is a systematic approach to building, deploying, and monitoring machine learning solutions. It is an engineering discipline that can be applied to many industries and use cases. The talk is filled with real-world examples to help you understand the application of MLOps. You will begin by finding out how to\n1. Build ML pipelines to train robust and scalable machine learning (ML) models.\n2. Deploy models securely in production.\n3. Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery for ML.\n4. Monitor ML and system performance in production.\n5. Build an automated ML workflow for your organization.\n\nEmmanuel Raj is a Senior Machine Learning Engineer with 6+ years of industry experience. Machine Learning Engineer at TietoEvry and Member of European AI Alliance at European Commission, he is passionate about democratizing AI, bringing research & academia to industry, and engineering end-to-end Machine Learning systems. Since 2015 he has focused on productizing machine learning solutions in the industry using technologies like MLOps, Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Edge Computing, and 5G. Over the years, he has worked on AI projects in multiple sectors such as Finance, Healthcare, Retail, E-commerce, Aviation, Marketing, and Manufacturing. A Master of Engineering (M.Eng) degree in Big Data Analytics from Arcada University of Applied Sciences. He has a keen interest in R&D using cutting-edge technologies such as Edge AI, Blockchain, MLOps, and Robotics. His recent paper \"Reliable Fleet Analytics for Edge IoT Solutions\" got awarded as the best paper of 2020 at IARIA conference held in Nice, France. Emmanuel believes that “the best way to learn is to teach\", as a result, he has authored the upcoming book “Engineering MLOps”. He is passionate about sharing and learning about new technologies with others.\n\n===\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
