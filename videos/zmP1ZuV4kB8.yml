description: "Do you need a better webcam, or a second or third webcam for live-streaming? I recently discovered how easy it is to build a webcam using the Raspberry Pi Zero and a Raspberry Pi camera. I'll take you through the steps like it's your first Pi project ever -- because it was mine! Not only does it work great, it only costs $25.\n\nTimestamps: \n0:00 Intro\n2:37 Supplies\n3:18 How to connect the camera cable\n4:42 Installing the software\n5:52 Connect to the correct USB port\n6:18 Adjusting the camera (if needed) with camera-ctl\n6:37 My cool enclosure\n7:04 Comparing the laptop Facetime camera to Piwebcam\n\nHere's what you'll need:\nRaspberry Pi Zero (with or without WiFi)\nRaspberry Pi camera (I used the cheapest one, 5 megapixel)\nCamera cable for Pi Zero\nMicro USB cable (often used for Android phone charging)\nSD card\nSoftware at http://piwebcam.github.io/\n\nThis is an easy way to get started in the world of Raspberry Pi! But what does it have to do with Oracle developers, you ask? Well, it turns out Oracle engineers love Raspberry Pi for all sorts of projects.

Included in the development preview is Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel Release 6, based on the upstream 5.4 kernel. https://www.oracle.com/linux/downloads/linux-arm-downloads.html\n\nAnd this engineer setting up a customer on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure recently set up a separate VPN tunnel to his own development network using libreswan on a Raspberry Pi:\nhttps://www.promatis.com/2021/01/20/using-a-raspberry-pi-to-connect-to-oracle-oci-ipsec-vpn/\n\n\n\n#RaspberryPi\n\nhttps://developer.oracle.com/"
