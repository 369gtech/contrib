title: 'Layne Sadler - AIQC: Framework for Reproducible and Rapid Deep Learning | PyData Boston Meetup'
language: English
recordingDate: 1616772520
description: "Joint PyData Boston & Boston Data Science March Meetup\n\nAIQC simplifies data preparation and parameter tuning for batches of deep learning models without an expensive cloud backend. It empowers researchers by reducing the programming and data science know-how required to integrate machine learning into their research. It makes machine learning less of a black box by reproducibly recording experiments in a file-based database that requires no configuration.\n\nThe talk will:\n(1) Describe the challenges I ran into when implementing best practices that academics encouraged me to adopt after reviewing my paper. Show the gaps this revealed in the mainstream machine learning workflow.\n(2) Demo the AIQC Python package on Kepler satellite data and brain tumor MRI scans.\n\nLearn more:\n- Read: https://aiqc.readthedocs.io/\n- Watch: https://youtube.com/watch?v=cN7d8c-3Vxc&list=PLzDUt2WiohNj7MUrYL3YxoPbXjt5iDEPz\n\n===\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
