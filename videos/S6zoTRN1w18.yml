recordingDate: 1496308791
description: "It is known that developers don't necessarily make good managers, yet most companies (us included!) make the mistake of \"promoting\" the most successful developers into managerial positions. A developer transitioning to a managerial position deals with various difficulties: a new team, managing people who until recently were co-workers. Most tech companies offer very little, if any, training for first-time managers; without the tools, training, or even having a clue as to what their job is, it's no wonder that many first-time managers fail.\n\nIn this talk Shai will discuss some of the mistakes we’ve made at Wix and the system we’re working on to support managers making their first steps including coaching, training and teaching.\n\nA great blog post by Shai about the subject:\nhttps://medium.com/@shaikfir/first-time-managers-reading-list-a47ace140762\n\nhttps://twitter.com/shaik\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/shaikfir/"
