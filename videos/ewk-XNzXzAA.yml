description: "Filmed at http://2016.dotswift.io on January 29th in Paris. More talks on http://thedotpost.com\n\nChris looks at how we can take standard networking code, and use Swift's features to make it generic and simple. While live-coding, he factors out common parts into a struct, so that the resulting code is easy to test and highly reusable."
