language: English
recordingDate: 1634148770
description: "The \"8-Bit\" era of the late '80s brought video games into the home with systems like the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). Game developers of the time produced iconic games and introduced genres that are still with us to this day, while working with hardware that had serious limitations. This talk will explore how NES developers created more with less, looking at techniques used in professionally-developed NES games to handle physics, collision detection, randomness, data compression, and more.\n\n\nKevin Zurawel\nCandid\n\nKevin has been an NES fan since he first played \"Super Mario Bros.\" in 1989. He learned to program out of a love of video games, and ended up with a career in web development. Kevin is currently an engineering manager at Candid and explores programming for old game consoles in his spare time.\n\n\nRecorded at Strange Loop 2021\nhttps://thestrangeloop.com"
