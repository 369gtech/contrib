description: "Azure is the #2 cloud in the world, but did you know it's an awesome place to deploy your Spring Boot applications in production?\n\nMicrosoft has had a full team working on Spring for the last 3 years, and they have delivered some great Spring Boot starters, tools and documentation.\n\nIn this session we will try to cover most of what Azure can offer from a Spring Boot perspective, including development, continuous integration, deployment and operations.\n\nJulien Dubois is an Azure developer advocate at Microsoft and the creator of JHipster, the popular full-stack development platform. He is a Java Champion, book author and frequent conference speaker."
