description: "Tomas is an academic, open-source developer and a book author. He is a lecturer at the University of Kent and is interested in making programming easier and data science more accessible. He also studies the history of programming and writes about it from a philosophical perspective.\n \nTomas wrote a popular F# book \"Real-World Functional Programming\", helped to create a number of F# open-source libraries such as F# Data and created coeffects (http://tomasp.net/coeffects), a theory of context-aware programming languages. \n\nSupport for asynchronous programming with async/await is now everywhere. You can use async/await in TypeScript, JavaScript, C# and even C++20. But how does async/await work behind the scenes? In this live coded talk, I will implement a support for async/await in F# from scratch and I will show how to use it to write a parallel, non-blocking crawler for Wikipedia. Youâ€™ll see that async/await relies on surprisingly simple ideas that you can understand even without knowing much about F#!"
