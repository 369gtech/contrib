title: 'Chris Stucchio: AI Ethics, Impossibility Theorems and Tradeoffs'
recordingDate: 1542723645
description: "In analytical philosophy, armchair philosophers ask theoretical questions like \"is it wrong to push one fat man onto train tracks in order to stop a trolley from smashing into 5 italian grandmothers?\" As AI ethics has become a concern, these problems have suddenly become practical and quantitative.\n\n\nIn this talk, I'll present some western liberal ethical principles that are important to algorithmic decision making. I'll provide a number of examples in lending, criminology and education which illustrate how it's impossible to simultaneously satisfy all these ethical principles. If time permits, I'll also discuss how these western principles are far from universal, and how most of the literature on the topic is relatively useless in non-western contexts (e.g., most literature focused on the US takes N=2, I don't even know how to count N in India). - Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/crunch"
