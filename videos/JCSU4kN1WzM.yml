language: Russian
recordingDate: 1613042172
description: "Ближайшая конференция: \nHolyJS 2021 Piter — 20-23 апреля, онлайн.\nПодробности и билеты: https://bit.ly/2LbN8bH\n\n. Many web developers know that ECMAScript has the specification for the core of JavaScript, but the specification itself has it's own formatting quirks. This presentation walks through quick examples on how to read and understand the aspects of built-in APIs and syntax grammar from ECMAScript.\n\nThe goal is to empower web practitioners — not limited to developers — to comprehend the text of the spec as implementers do. This should enable channels between everyone and create opportunities for those who want to get involved with the standards process set by TC39."
