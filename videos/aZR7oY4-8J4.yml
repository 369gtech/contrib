description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX\nPresenters: Phil Berman, Michael Minella & Derrick Shields\nBig Data Track\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/iot-realized-the-connected-car-53122510\n\nFor this session we will explore the power of Spring XD in the context of the Internet of Things (IoT). We will look at a solution developed with Spring XD to stream real time analytics from a moving car using open standards. Ingestion of the real time data (location, speed, engine diagnostics, etc) into HDFS, analyzing it to provide highly accurate MPG and vehicle range prediction, as well as providing real time dashboards will all be covered. Coming out of this session, you’ll understand how Spring XD can serve as “Legos®” for the IoT. We've made some very cool updates to the app (multi-car support, uses Hadoop and Spark, and more). We also are hoping to be running our app on Cloud Foundry by the conference!"
