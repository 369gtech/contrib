title: 'Deep Dive in Docker Overlay Networks'
language: English
recordingDate: 1494276234
description: 'The Docker network overlay driver relies on several technologies: network namespaces, VXLAN, Netlink and a distributed key-value store. This talk will present each of these mechanisms one by one along with their userland tools and show hands-on how they interact together when setting up an overlay to connect containers. The talk will continue with a demo showing how to build your own simple overlay using these technologies.'
