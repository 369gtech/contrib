description: "(Recorded at Jfokus 2016. http://www.jfokus.com)\n\nJava Streams: Beyond The Basics\n\nLambda expressions and the streams API add a more functional style of programming to Java; something developers have not really had in the past. The session will start with a short summary of the key features of both Lambda expressions and streams before moving on to some real world examples of how to use them effectively, including some pitfalls that should be avoided. We'll finish off with a quick look at some of the ideas for improvements to streams in JDK 9.\n\nSimon Ritter, Azul Systems\n\nSimon Ritter is the Deputy CTO of Azul Systems.
