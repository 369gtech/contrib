description: "Besides being criticized for disrupting the control flow, exception handling in Java is often considered cumbersome and not very aesthetically appealing.\n\nIn this session, we’ll have a look at how functional languages approach error handling, what can we learn from them and how to adapt those solutions in the world of Java.\n\nSimply put, we'll see how can we avoid “throws” and \"try-catch\" by leveraging type-driven-development (Optional, Try, Either).\n#FunctionalProgramming\n\nPresented by Grzegorz Piwowarek\n\n#Devoxx #DevoxxPoland #IT #Development #SoftwareDevelopment"
