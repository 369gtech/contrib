description: "PyData Tel Aviv Meetup #18\n16 December 2018\nHosted by Waze\nhttps://www.meetup.com/PyData-Tel-Aviv/\n\nUntreated mental health conditions often result in a negative spiral, which can culminate in repeated jail bookings. This has long term consequences both for the affected individual and the community as a whole.\nThis past summer, \"Data Science for Social Good\" partnered with Johnson County to predict subsequent jail bookings with the goal of prioritizing mental health outreach.\nOur work provides a computational framework and prototype system for many jurisdictions to proactively connect social and mental health workers with individuals in need of care to avoid incarceration.\n\nIris is a data scientist and a computational biologist who believes wholeheartedly in the power of data science in bettering communities.\nShe is an M.Sc. graduate from the Weizmann Institute of Science, who recently spent her summer in Chicago as a Data Science for Social Good Fellow.\n\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
