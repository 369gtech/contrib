description: "From Java function source to running pod in 5 minutes ...\n\nSimplifying the work for the developer building serverless apps and functions is one of the primary goals for both the riff project and the Knative project. In this talk we will show you how you can build a Java function from scratch and then deploy it in simple steps without having to deal with Docker or Kubernetes configuration files. Once your function is running we'll show you how you can have it subscribe to events and also how to have your function add new events to be passed to the next function in the chain. This talk consists of mostly live coding while also explaining the concepts and basic building blocks for building serverless apps and functions as well as event processing systems based on riff and Knative.\n\nSpeaker:\nDave Syer\nSenior Consulting Engineer, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
