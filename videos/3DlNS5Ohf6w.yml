description: "Erlang User Conference 2013\nMore info and slides on the website: http://www.erlang-factory.com/conference/ErlangUserConference2013/talks \n\nIn this talk, we'll walk you through the evolution of AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol) usage at SoundCloud. How we advanced from running a single RabbitMQ broker coordinating and scaling media uploads and processing, to a multi-broker topology enabling us to split monolithic applications (and teams) and to embrace a scalable, distributed and service oriented architecture."
