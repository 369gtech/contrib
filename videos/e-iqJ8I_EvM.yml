recordingDate: 1571304283
description: 'Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers over 165 fully featured cloud services from data centers globally. AWS launched its first data streaming service, Amazon Kinesis Data Streams, over five years ago. Now, customers are using streaming data across most AWS services including two that support running Apache Flink, Amazon EMR and Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics. In this keynote, we will describe how customers and their use of streaming data has evolved on AWS. We will look at how streaming data and Apache Flink are used externally and internally on AWS, and where we see usage of Apache Flink growing.'
