description: "Dom Davis kicks us off Day 2 of #NorDevCon2020!\n\nA big welcome to our delegates and speakers, a quick introduction to Norfolk Developers, and our Code of Conduct (https://2020.nordevcon.com/code-of-conduct).\n\n## About Dom Davis\n\nDom Davis is a veteran of The City and a casualty of The Financial Crisis. Not content with bringing the world to its knees he then went off to help break the internet before winding up in Norfolk where he messes about doing development and devops. Dom has been writing code since his childhood sometime in the last millennium â€“ he hopes some day to become good at it.\n\nDom is an enthusiastic and impassioned speaker [read: he gabbles] who uses a blend of irreverent sarcasm and flippant humour to bring complex subjects to a broad audience. Whether or not they understand him is up for debate, but he likes to believe they do.\n\n## About nor(DEV):con\n\nThe eastern region's biggest tech conference runs annually in February with a fantastic line-up of speakers and workshops. In our fifth year we joined 41 speakers, over 5 tracks, speaking on a wide range of subjects. Day 1 kicked off with technical deep dives into popular and important languages, frameworks and process. Our key theme for 2020 was wellbeing, with plenty of talks on the main stage around the subject on Day 2, alongside Workshops and plenty of tech talk too.\n\nYou can read more about the line up for 2020 at https://2020.nordevcon.com/ or watch 2021 shape up on our main site https://nordevcon.com/\n\n## About Norfolk Developers\n\nComplementing the existing tech community, Norfolk Developers will be peeling back the high level and going straight to the heart of software development practices and processes. We aim to bring you local, national and international speakers and workshops.\n\nYou might want to try something new or wish to take your software development up to the next level. Norfolk Developers wants to jump depth-first into the detail and bring you practical value. We want to make it easy for you to access knowledge, progress and prosper in the highly specialised and valuable field of software engineering.\n\nFollow us https://twitter.com/NorfolkDev or join the community https://www.meetup.com/Norfolk-Developers-NorDev/"
