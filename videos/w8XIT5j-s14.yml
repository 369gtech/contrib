description: "Support Arm64 platform in Envoy - Lizan Zhou\n\nEnvoy Arm64 will be released from 1.16.0. In this LT Lizan will discuss about the effort to make Envoy officially support Arm64 based Linux. This includes some code / test change caused by different endian / memory layout and compiler defaults, how we identified these problems, and how we built CI infrastructure."
