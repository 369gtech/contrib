description: "PyData London Meetup #48\nTuesday, September 4, 2018\n\nProbabilistic Programming is a new paradigm enabling a better\nunderstanding of uncertainty. I introduce a modern Bayesian workflow and explanation of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo - how it fails and how you debug it.\n\nSponsored & Hosted by Man AHL\n\n****\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other.
