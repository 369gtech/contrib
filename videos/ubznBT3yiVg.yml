title: 'YOW! West 2015 Ben Dechrai - Web Application Security: Winning when the Odds are Against You'
recordingDate: 1514639789
description: "Even the simplest web application has so many vectors of attack, it’s no wonder most people forget at least one. Web applications aren’t stand-alone; they are built upon frameworks, upon platforms, upon core libraries, each of which could suffer from vulnerabilities you’re not only unaware of, you’re statistically unlikely to discover them all. Consider, for example, last year’s OpenSSL “Heartbleed” Bug.\n\nWe hear about security vulnerabilities every week, now it’s time to experience them. Find out what the leading concerns are, and the not so common ones too, and experience live demonstrations of how these attacks play out.\n\nThis presentation aims to arm you with the mindset, tools and resources to minimise the opportunities for attack, and to reduce the fallout when they succeed. From cross-site scripting and session hijacking to brute force and man-in-the-middle attacks, you’re expected to cover all your bases so the bad guys can’t use a single one.\n\nBen Dechrai is a technologist, teacher, author, presenter and hard-core privacy nut, but most of all, he is a passionate supporter of gigantic ideas, minds and goals.\n\nAn experienced PHP developer, Ben has used, taught and shared experience of the language since 1999, including aspects to security and best practice required to allow PHP to become an engineer’s tool, rather than the scripting language that has earned a poor reputation.\n\nHe is or has been an active member of the Open Source Developers’ Conference, Linux Conference Australia, Melbourne PHP Users Group, BarCampMelbourne, and Linux Users Victoria.\n\nFor more on YOW!
