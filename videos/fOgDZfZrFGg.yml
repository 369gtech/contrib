description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nCase Study : Improving Resilience of Applications in Telco Environments - Uma Mukkara, ChaosNative & Samar Sidharth, Orange\n\nThough Kubernetes acts as a common abstraction and as a platform to build other platforms or applications, challenges are unique to each environment or area of operations. Telcos operate at a larger scale compared to the other environments. In these environments, the challenges of moving the applications to cloud native include a plan on the reliability of the whole service right from the beginning to the state of operations. In this session, we discuss a case study from Orange, the telecommunications operator, where they have been using Litmus, Kubernetes and other CNCF technologies to build and scale their application development process all the way till shipping them. We discuss their resilience goals of the cloud native application, scale factor, original challenges, impediments, the approach and the actual design along with the learnings in this case study. The session will wrap up with the key takeaways around resilience building technicals for large scale applications."
