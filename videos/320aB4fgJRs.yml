description: "The commoditization of the cloud has made it easier than ever to build an application that scale up or out as we desire. However, a traditional mindset of building applications to be deployed into web farms can result in a cost explosion that might make us question whether we’re really enjoying any cost-saving benefits.\n\nWhen we’re building a web application with a rich front end experience do we really need beefy webservers to run it?\n\nThis is where the power of serverless comes in, allowing us to scale rapidly with a minimal cost impact.\n\nIn this talk we’ll look at how to build a Single Page Application (SPA), that can handle thousands of requests per second but cost us only dollars per month by being smart about the kinds of Azure resources we are consuming.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks, courses, and conferences in the following links:\nhttps://ndcsydney.com/\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
