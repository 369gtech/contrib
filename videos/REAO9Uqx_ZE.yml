description: "Amy and Ignacia will talk about their work to foster a culture of collaboration and a community of practitioners to support the GOV.UK Design System. They will discuss some of the challenges of enabling collaboration touching on key questions like:\n\n— how can you break down silos in the face of long-established department structures, tight delivery deadlines and competing interests?\n— how can you get people from different roles, backgrounds and locations to converge and contribute to a centralised resource, in an organisation as large as government?\n\nIn this talk they will explain how – by working together with different departments, teams and disciplines to create the processes and contents of the GOV.UK Design System – they’ve built collaboration into its foundations.\n\nAbout the speakers:\n..................................\n— Amy Hupe – GOV.UK Design System Content Lead. Previously Digital Content Creator at Which?. Consistently delivering content that is user-focused, clear and engaging.\n— Ignacia Orellana Drago – Service Designer at Government Digital Service. Designing services that work across all channels and are inclusive of all users, always looking for cost-effective, sustainable solutions.\n\nAbout the conference:\n.....................................\nDesign conference that’s not about buzzwords, but collaboration between designers. Our 5th User Experience design conference on March 2020 was themed around how UX, UI, content and graphic designers can work together better. \n\nWe've had insightful talks on day 1 and hands-on workshops on day 2 by speakers with experience working in Transport for London, OpenTable, The Paciello Group, Nike, Government Digital Service, Airbnb, Shopify, InVision, DuckDuckGo and others.
