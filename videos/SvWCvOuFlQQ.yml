title: 'Tomas Herceg. Project Tye — Building microservices in .NET Core'
language: English
recordingDate: 1619617902
description: "Tye is a tool for developers that simplifies developing, testing, and deploying microservices and distributed apps. It was created by a few people from the .NET team, and despite it’s still considered as an experiment, it looks very promising. In this session, I’ll show how you can build and run your multi-project .NET Core solution with Tye and deploy it to a Kubernetes cluster. I’ll also talk about Zipkin, a useful tool that can help understand what’s going on inside the app.\n\nPresentation: https://disk.yandex.ru/i/dktDQ1K0vPId2w\n\nDotFest: https://2020.dotfest.ru/lecture/11"
