description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2013\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nShmuel Gerson - Technical leader at Intel Corporation\n\nABSTRACT\nWe're working hard to provide value in the form of software. And perhaps this is precisely what is turning our customers off: We focus on software too much and may be looking at its real worth too little.\n\nShmuel talks about software as a knowledge media and reveals a strategy that serves the company and the users in an entirely different way: It changes the way we code and document our software (\"did I reach the most faithful reproduction of knowledge?\"), and changes the way you add value with your testing (\"what else don't we know?\").\n\nCome and learn what is wrong with software-as-a-product and alternatives that can determine your project's success -- complete with Practical People Principles for software construction you can start to apply in your day to day approach.\n\nThe alternatives I will mention in the end of the talk are, roughly:\n- Make your team aware (get scribes everywhere)\n- Cherchez le côté humain (humans build software, humans use software)\n- Scratch a personal itch (tell your own story in software)\n- Let the ends justify the means (hint: the end is not \"release now\")\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
