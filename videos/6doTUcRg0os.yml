description: "In this talk, Shane explores what we have learned about creating environments where engineering teams can be at their most effective irrespective of where they work - remotely, in-person or hybrid. He draws on research and experience working with teams from all around the world across the last 30+ years and highlights practices, attitudes and behaviours which are needed to create environments of psychological safety, radical candor and productive collaboration.\n\nReferences: \nCulture & Methods Trends Report March 2021 - https://www.infoq.com/articles/culture-trends-2021/\n\nHow Workplace Culture Affects Workplace Performance - https://www.infoq.com/articles/workplace-culture-affests-performance/\n\nThe Value of Playfulness and Mindfulness in Work - https://www.infoq.com/podcasts/work-playfulness-mindfulness/\n\nBreaking the Taboo â€“ What I Learned from Talking about Mental Health in the Workplace - https://www.infoq.com/articles/talking-about-mental-health/\n\nNew Approaches to Engineer Onboarding with Kristen Buchanan - https://www.infoq.com/podcasts/engineer-onboarding/\n\nSangeeta Narayanan of Netflix on Improving the Developer Experience - https://www.infoq.com/podcasts/improving-developer-experience-netflix/\n\nLessons Learned from Self-Selection Reteaming at Redgate - https://www.infoq.com/articles/self-selection-reteaming-redgate/\n\nLeading with Empathy - https://www.infoq.com/articles/leading-empathy/\n\nRebroadcast: Kim Scott on Radical Candor - https://www.infoq.com/podcasts/kim-scott-radical-candor/\n\nThe InfoQ eMag: Holacracy Sociocracy - https://www.infoq.com/minibooks/emag-holacracy-sociocracy/\n\nBusiness and Technical Agility with Team Topologies - https://www.infoq.com/presentations/team-topologies-technical-agility/\n\nWhat Makes Joy,Inc Work?
