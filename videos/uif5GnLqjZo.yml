description: "Creating a Culture of Software Craftsmanship\n[EuroPython 2018 - Talk - 2018-07-27 - Moorfoot]\n[Edinburgh, UK]\n\nBy Keith Harrison\n\nThis time it’ll be different. It’s a green field project and you’ve learned from your mistakes. You’re not going to make the same ones again.\n\nFast forward several months and you’re in a mess. A change in one place causes bugs in a completely different place. Adding a simple feature means making changes all over your application. Progress is getting slower and slower. You’re lost in complexity.\n\nWhy does this keep happening and what can we do about it? \n\nThis talk will try to answer those questions.\n\nI’ll show how complex software really is, define the different types of complexity found in software, explain the issues complexity causes and discuss different techniques we can use to manage it.\n\nThis talk is suitable for anyone who has worked or will work on a software development project. No development experience is required.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2018.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
