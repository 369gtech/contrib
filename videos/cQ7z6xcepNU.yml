description: "Dispatch - A Serverless Framework - Berndt Jung & Mark Peek, VMware\n\n This session will discuss the Dispatch open source serverless framework from VMware. The Dispatch framework uses other open source FaaS implementations (such as OpenFaaS, OpenWhisk, and RIFF) to provide an easier developer experience while adding in IT/Ops features such as multi-tenancy, monitoring, and visibility. This talk will demonstrate Dispatch leveraging RIFF for function execution and services via Open Service Broker API (CF service broker and Kubernetes service catalog).\n\nAbout Berndt Jung\nBerndt is currently a Sr. Manager of Engineering at VMware overseeing the serverless effort.  This effort has resulted in the open source serverless platform, Dispatch.  Previously, Berndt worked as a Staff Engineer in the Cloud Native Applications Business Unit.\n\nAbout Mark Peek\nMark is a Principal Engineer at VMware working across areas of interest such as cloud management, cloud native applications, and open source. Currently, he is leading the work on serverless within VMware. Mark contributes to a wide range of open source projects and is the VMware representative for the Cloud Foundry TAB, CNCF, and OCI.\n\nMark has spoken at a number of conferences, most recently KubeCon 2017 where he co-presented \"State of Serverless\"."
