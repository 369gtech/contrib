description: "Steve Jurvetson is a partner at DFJ. Steve has a reputation for investing in pioneering companies that create new sectors. Two early bets include the Elon Musk-led companies SpaceX and Tesla. (He owns both a Tesla sedan and an SUV and holds board seats at both companies.) Steve serves on the board of directors for Planet, a company that has launched the largest constellation of Earth-observation microsatellites; D-Wave, a quantum computing company which counts Google, NASA, and Lockheed-Martin as customers; and Mythic, a provider of a local AI hardware and software platform that turns devices into secure and trusted intelligent assistants. He previously held a board seat at deep learning company Nervana (acquired by Intel in 2016). Steve holds an undergraduate degree at Stanford in electrical engineering. He maintains a fascination for space and has turned DFJâ€™s office into a museum showcasing his space artifact collection.\n\nSubscribe to O'Reilly on YouTube: http://goo.gl/n3QSYi\n\nFollow O'Reilly on: \nTwitter: http://twitter.com/oreillymedia\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/OReilly\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/oreillymedia\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/8459/"
