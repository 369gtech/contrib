description: "by Mario Behling\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/K.4.401/psl.webm\n\n\nThe goal of Pocket Science Lab is to miniaturize laboratories with FOSS and Open Hardware. We have released the first commercial FOSS version. The talk covers our journey from developing FOSS Hardware and to scaling up to large scale production. The goal of Pocket Science Lab is to miniaturize laboratories. We have released the first commercial FOSS version. The talk covers our journey from developing FOSS Hardware and to scaling up to large scale production. \n\nPSLab is a tiny pocket science lab that provides an array of test and measurement instruments for doing science and engineering experiments. It can function like an oscilloscope, waveform generator, frequency counter, programmable voltage and current source and also as a data logger. An Android app is developed and available on app stores. A desktop version is available in Python. In the session we will also explain how the software applications with their unique functionalities help to grow the PSLab and Open Science community. \n\nRoom: K.4.401\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 14:30:00+01"
