description: "The talk from .NET Fest conference in Kyiv, Ukraine.\nPresentation: http://bit.ly/2NpgMr3\nFb: https://www.facebook.com/dotNETFest/\nWebsite: http://dotnetfest.com/\n\n\nA Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is the basis of modern system authentication; X.509 certificates are at the core of modern cryptography. Building your own PKI is not for the faint of heart, so we usually buy our certificates from an external Certificate Authority or operate a 3rd-party off-the-shelf PKI.\nBut what can you do if you need to issue your own certificates while keeping your costs low? What if, for example, you're in the business of manufacturing millions of IoT devices and you need to issue a certificate to each and every one of them? And to top it off - you want to do it in a Serverless manner?\nJoin me in this session, as we build a Serverless PKI system with Azure Functions & Key-Vault and learn all about Key-Vault's capabilities in regards to X.509 certificates along the way."
