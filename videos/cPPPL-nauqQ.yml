title: 'Strata 2013: Prasad Ram, "Using Data to Honor the Human Right to Education"'
recordingDate: 1362004219
description: "http://strataconf.com/\nMore than ever before, students are using the Internet to study, leaving behind a trail of valuable data. How can we leverage this data to improve education? Learning analytics focused on tracking student activity and performance provides strong insights, but the bigger opportunity is to \"close-the-loop\" and use the data for the student's benefit. With Gooru (www.goorulearning.org), a free search engine for learning, we can see what web resources are the most popular, what topics students are looking to study, how much time students are spending studying specific resources and the corresponding learning outcome. With this data, we can deliver personalized learning on a scale that can honor the human right to education.\n\nThis keynote is sponsored by inBloom\n\nhttp://strataconf.com/strata2013/public/schedule/detail/28256"
