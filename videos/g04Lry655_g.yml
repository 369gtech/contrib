Angular and Chrome worked together to enable optimizations by default that will improve users' first input delay, largest contentful paint, and cumulative layout shift.\n\nIn this talk, we'll explore some of the optimizations Angular does under the hood to improve your CWV metrics. At the second part of the presentation, we'll explore techniques for debugging and optimization to achieve the perfect performance score ðŸš€\n\nng-conf is a multi-day Angular conference focused on delivering the highest quality training in the Angular JavaScript framework. 1000's of developers from across the globe join together to attend talks and workshops by the Angular team and other community experts.\n\nFollow us on twitter https://twitter.com/ngconfâ€‹ \nOfficial Website: https://www.ng-conf.org/"
