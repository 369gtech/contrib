description: "Introduction to sentiment analysis with spaCy\n[EuroPython 2018 - Talk - 2018-07-26 - PyCharm [PyData]]\n[Edinburgh, UK]\n\nBy Thomas Aglassinger\n\nSentiment analysis aims at extracting opinions from texts written in natural language, typically reviews or comments on social sites and forums. SpaCy already provides mechanisms for dealing with natural languages in general but does not offer means for sentiment analysis.\n\nThis talk gives a short introduction to sentiment analysis in general and shows how to extract topics and ratings by utilizing spaCy's basic tools and extending them with a lexicon based approach and simple Python code to consolidate sentiments spread over multiple words.\n\nTopic covered are:\n\n\nWhat is sentiment analysis?\nLevels of sentiment detection\nRepresenting opinions\nSplitting texts in sentences and words.\nFinding the base word (lemma)\nExtending spaCy's pipeline and tokens\nMatching words to topics and ratings\nCombining multiple words to a rating\n\n\nCode examples are introduced and explained using a Jupyter notebook that can be used as basis for your own analysis.\n\nAs additional twist the analyzed texts are not in English but German to show that this approach can be used for multiple languages. No knowledge of German is required though because translations of the short examples sentences are provided.\n\nAuthor's note: This is an extended version of a talk I gave at the PyDays Vienna 2018. The original slides and Jupyter notebook are available at https://github.com/roskakori/talks/tree/master/pydays/analyzingnaturallanguagefeedbackusing_python.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2018.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
