description: "From Strata + Hadoop World 2015 in Singapore: In this talk, Reynold will look back and review Spark’s growth in adoption, use cases, and development. He will then look forward and discuss both technical initiatives and the evolution of the Spark community for 2016.\n\n2015 is the year of data science and platformization for Apache Spark. With new high-level APIs (e.g. DataFrames, machine learning pipelines, R) and extension points, Spark is accessible to a wider set of users and can plug in a myriad of data sources, algorithms, and external packages. 2015 also marks the beginning of Project Tungsten, a major revamp of Spark’s execution engine to improve its robustness and performance. In 2016, we will continue pushing the boundaries of these dimensions, making Spark even easier and more powerful.\n\nAbout Reynold Xin (Databricks): Reynold Xin is a committer on Apache Spark. He is also a co-founder of Databricks. Before Databricks, he was pursuing a Ph.D. in the University of California-Berkeley AMPLab.\n\nWatch more from Strata + Hadoop Singapore 2015: https://goo.gl/lBSB0b\nVisit the O’Reilly data website: oreilly.com/data\nDon't miss an upload!
