description: "Many JVM languages promote \"less boilerplate code\" as one of their selling points. Even updates to Java in recent years have removed unnecessary syntax. While this is clearly meant to be a Good Thing, many of us - particularly if we've been writing Java for a long time - think \"so what?\". Our IDEs can generate code, and our brains get used to ignoring the stuff that doesn't matter.\n\nIs the removal of extraneous code from the syntax of a language necessary, or just a gimmick? How does it impact our ability to write and read code?\n\nIn this talk, Trisha will explore common coding scenarios using Java and Kotlin. We'll see what's important for developers to write (and, more importantly, read) and what can be removed. We'll also see how Java has evolved to improve our productivity as producers and consumers of code, and why understanding new languages and staying up to date with the features of Java can ultimately make your life easier."
