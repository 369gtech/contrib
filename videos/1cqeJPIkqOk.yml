description: "\"Speaker: Charlotte Mays\n\nMany new coders seek out open source projects, intending to contribute, and then get overwhelmed and leave. Project maintainers often want the help, but don’t realize how they are inadvertently appearing unwelcoming. I will discuss some of the most common complaints I’ve heard from new coders who tried to contribute but left in frustration, and ways that these can be addressed without putting too much burden on the maintainers.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2019 and https://github.com/PyCon/2019-slides\""
