description: "Have you ever been taught that “modularizing” CSS via an endless number of “reusable” object-like “classes” is the “proper” way to use CSS on “large-scale websites”, or have you taught others that these are “best practices”? Do you think there’s a difference between the term “large-scale websites” and “enterprise websites”? When I say “inheritance” and “specificity”, do you feel dirty?\n\nIf you answered yes to the above questions, then you, my friend, are going to absolutely hate this session.\n\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/stephenhay/the-backsideoftheclass\nAbout Stephen: http://www.the-haystack.com\n\nMore about CSS Day: http://cssday.nl or https://twitter.com/cssdayconf\nReceive conference announcements in your inbox: http://cssday.nl/subscribe"
