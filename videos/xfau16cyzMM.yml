description: "For the past 3 years d4rkm4tter has been obsessed with monitoring the wireless networks at DEF CON. This talk will take you on a journey through the successes and failures that lead to the creation of the WiFiCactus and the over 1 TB of data captured. A history of each capture project including a summary of the most interesting pieces of data will be shown.\n\nMany people spread a lot of fear, uncertainty and doubt about the wireless environments during DEF CON. This presentation aims to bring some clarity to what is really happening in the airwaves during one of the largest hacker conferences in the world. This will include presenting data on the attacks and sensitive information that exists in the airwaves. This presentation will demonstrate the risks of using wireless networks and information leaks that can be captured by anyone who is passively listening. Countermeasures and protection strategies will be provided to help you avoid having your data captured by those who might be listening.\n\nWith the number of connected devices around us, there has never been a better time to start wardriving or warwalking. Everyone is capable of profiling wireless data around them thanks to cheap hardware and open source tools. As hackers it is important for us to discover issues and vulnerabilities while validating claims of security by software and hardware vendors. Monitoring wireless communication is a great way to start validating those claims. All of the hardware and methods used will be provided so that anyone can do this type of monitoring on their own. Hack the Planet!\n\nd4rkm4tter (Mike Spicer)\nd4rkm4tter is a mad scientist hacker who likes to meddle with hardware and software. He is particularly obsessed with wireless. He has a degree in computer science from Southern Utah University which he has put to use building and breaking a wide array of systems. These include web application pentesting, wireless monitoring and tracking as well as good old fashioned reverse engineering. He is the creator of the #WiFiCactus and has been seen presenting Demolabs at DEF CON and DEF CON China Beta.
