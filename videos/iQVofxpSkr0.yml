description: "Day 2: Spring Tips: Configuration\n\nHi, Spring fans! Spring is an inversion-of-control container. Inversion of control insulates objects from the knowledge of how a collaborating object on which they depend are created. It also insulates objects from their environment, letting them exist blissfully unaware of where individual configuration properties–like passwords, URLs, etc.–originate. In this talk, we’re going to explore the Environment which connects objects to configuration properties. We’ll also look at PropertySources, profiles, @ConfigurationProperties, the @Value annotation, the Spring Cloud Config Server and Spring Cloud Vault for Hashicorp Vault.\n\n---\n\nJosh Long\n@starbuxman\n\nJosh Long is a Spring Developer Advocate at VMware. Josh is a Java Champion, author of five books (including O'Reilly's \"Cloud Native Java: Designing Resilient Systems with Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, and Cloud Foundry\") and three best-selling video trainings (including \"Building Microservices with Spring Boot Livelessons\" w/ Phil Webb), and an open-source contributor (Spring Boot, Spring Integration, Spring Cloud, Activiti and Vaadin)."
