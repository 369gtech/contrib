description: "No matter how fast you ship software, a good design is critical to security. Cloud native systems are no exception. Containerized microservices running on distributed management and orchestration platforms, bring new challenges to address as well as classic software problems that we’ve been dealing with for years. Secure software design patterns can be used to model security controls at different trust boundaries within your architecture, providing security in a repeatable and consumable way. Using patterns such as the Service Mesh or Ambassador pattern lets us focus on proper security control placement and lifting security outside of the core services we’ve traditionally bolted security onto later.\n\nEVENT:\n\nOWASP NLChapter Meeting 2019\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nJack Mannino\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWHi8KgOZpw"
