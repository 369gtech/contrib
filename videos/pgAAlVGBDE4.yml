description: "From a developer's perspective, running a Java application on Cloud Foundry appears to consist of pushing a compiled artifact and getting a running process. From the platform's perspective though, there's a whole lot more going on. In this talk, the lead developer of the Java Buildpack will walk you through what goes on during application staging and what the buildpack can do for you. It will cover everything from dependency resolution to memory calculation and will even discuss how to integrate with marketplace services with no application configuration.\n\nBen Hale, Cloud Foundry Java Lead, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2017"
