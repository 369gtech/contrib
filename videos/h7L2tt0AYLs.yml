recordingDate: 1624461409
description: "Stretch Leadership Meetup is Stretch Conference's (stretchcon.com) free online meetup series, where we bring you great leaders to learn from them and get inspired by their stories.\n\nEmpowerment, trust, dynamics, togetherness, feedback, sharing are key elements of a performing and solid team: but how can you build and save all these factors virtually, and virtually only?\n\nTamás's been around digital innovations since Napster winked on the music industry by introducing MP3s and exchanged our audiovisual content consumption from good-old music and video cassettes to digital ( yeah Tamas is from ancient times ). He has been leading international innovation teams for a decade, and is obsessed with solving problems that led him to become a passionate design thinker and service designer."
