description: "PULL OVER!\nNo, it is a cardigan, but thanks for noticing! After getting a nasty speeding ticket, OG SecKC HA/KC/ER hevnsnt decided enough was enough, and set out to fully understand police speed measurement devices, and develop homebrew countermeasures that are legal in some states (and some that are not). Come learn how police RF (X, K, KA) and Laser speed detection systems work and how to implement your own homebrew jamming countermeasures on the cheap, essentially making your vehicle invisible to law enforcement. HOP IN and BUCKLE UP, this talk is going to FUEL your hardware hacking desires! You better be able to think fast to keep up with this talk and prepare to get home in record time.\n\nBill Swearingen\nBill Swearingen (hevnsnt) has been in the hacking scene for decades, which is odd because his twitter profile says he is only 23 years old. Having spent his life dedicated to understanding how how things work, he is has focused this curiosity and knowledge to take advantage of our world in any way possible. His interests have always been focused on hardware hacking and loves releasing easy to replicate projects using cheap computing platforms such as Arduino and RaspberryPi.\n\nTwitter: @hevnsnt"
