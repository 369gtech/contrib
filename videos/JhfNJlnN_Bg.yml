title: 'DeepFake Chatbots'
language: English
recordingDate: 1582571009
description: "Google just released a paper describing a chatbot titled \"Meena\", and they claimed that it's the most human-like chatbot ever created. That's a big claim! They demonstrated several conversations across a wide variety of topics in which Meena was able to skillfully joke, argue, and question a human in a realistic way. In this episode, we'll analyze Meena's architecture by comparing it to the previous generations of chatbots, then build our own 'DeepFake' chatbot using state of the art tools for text, audio, and video generation. I'm using the increasingly popular term DeepFake here because deep learning will increasingly be used to mimic/fake human personalities. These free, public tools are becoming incredibly powerful, and I hope this gives you a sense of what you can build today with modern language models. Enjoy! \n\nSubscribe for more educational videos!
