description: "Question:\nI have been teaching myself to code for almost a year now. I initially started from Freecodecamp.com and other tutorials, the more I learn about web technologies like javascript the more I want to learn lower level languages like c++. A part of me wants to go back to college and study computer science. I have done a little research and many seem to say that it is not necessary but I want be marketable for a career in software development. I have read that the industry is being flooded with junior developers that don't know enough to be productive so I suppose that is why I think I need to go back to school. I had been applying to companies that fit my skill set and I haven't received one response regarding an interview.\nI would really appreciate your advice on whether I should bite the bullet and go back to college or keep getting better at javascript and web technologies ie react, angular...\n\nAnswer:\n[See video]\n\nAbout Preethi:\nPreethi Kasireddy is an engineer based in San Francisco.
