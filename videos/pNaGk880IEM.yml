description: "http://velocityconf.com\nDelivering truly great Web performance has never been easy. There's simply a lot that can go wrong between point A and point B. In today's world, the challenge has grown exponentially. Point A could be your own data center, a public cloud provider, or some hybrid combination. Point B could be a user on an Ethernet connected laptop or a mobile device on a spotty 3G connection, or almost an infinite combination of network, devices and browsers. How can you ensure that all users get the best Web experience possible, no matter what the situation? Akamai's Chief Architect, Stephen Ludin, will highlight ways to identify the end users' situation, determine the best optimizations to employ and how those optimizations directly impact performance -- all with the end goal of providing an answer to the situational performance challenge.\n\nThis keynote is sponsored by Akamai\n\nhttp://velocityconf.com/velocity2013/public/schedule/speaker/122026"
