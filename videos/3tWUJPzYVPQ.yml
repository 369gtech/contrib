title: 'Webinar: Kubernetes Cost Allocation Done Right'
language: English
recordingDate: 1593024258
description: "Measuring costs in Kubernetes environments is complex. Applications and their resources needs are often dynamic. Teams share resources without transparent prices attached to workloads while organizations are increasingly running resources on disparate machine types and even multiple cloud providers. Kubecost provides an approach built on open source for ensuring consistent and accurate visibility across all your workloads. They will share best practices, and different approaches for implementing cost monitoring in your organization for a showback/chargeback program, and how to empower users to act on this information.\n\nPresenters:\n\nWebb Brown, Co-founder and CEO @Kubecost\nAjay Tripathy, CTO @Kubecost."
