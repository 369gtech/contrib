description: "Here is the link to the presentation: https://goo.gl/pQcrT7\n\nFree and open source, Ionic offers a library of mobile-optimized HTML, CSS and JS components and tools for building highly interactive native and progressive web apps. Built with Sass, optimised for AngularJS. \n\nIonic is modeled off of standard native mobile development SDKs, bringing the UI standards of native apps together with the full power and flexibility of the open web. Ionic runs inside Cordova or Phonegap to deploy natively, or as a Progressive Web App. Develop once, deploy everywhere."
