description: "Allen is a consulting engineer with a background in enterprise systems. His current obsessions are IoT and Machine Learning. When not chained to his desk he can be found fixing broken things, playing music very badly or trying to shape things out of wood. He runs his own company specializing in systems architecture, optimization and scaling. Allen is a chartered engineer, a Fellow of the British Computing Society, a Microsoft Insider, and both a CodeProject and C-Sharp Corner MVP. \n\nCode Europe is the largest programming conference in Poland. Over 9400 people took part in it's second edition. We'll be back in December, so stay tuned and check our website: https://www.codeeurope.pl/en"
