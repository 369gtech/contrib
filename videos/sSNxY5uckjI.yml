While applying proven design principles, the available and growing ecosystem also enabled us to focus on the domain: Travel search and booking are depending on hundreds of requests to (inherently unreliable) 3rd party APIs. How can you leverage our learnings to build a great product?\n\nRead the full abstract: http://bit.ly/2MxP1ef\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - MICHAEL KRAX\nVP of Engineering at Qixxit\n\nMichael heads up the engineering team at Qixxit - including the Elixir team responsible for finding the best route for Qixxit's customers and allowing them to book tickets.  Before that, he worked on different products, including high performance computing in C/C++.  At university, he acquired a degree in political science, but he has been coding since the 90s.\n\nMore on Michael Krax: http://bit.ly/2MxP1ef\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE ELIXIR LDN 18\nWebsite: www.codesync.global\nTwitter: www.twitter.com/CodeElixirIO\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/CodeSyncGlobal\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/code-sync/\nMail: info at codesync.global"
