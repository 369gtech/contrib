description: "Learning is a part of our survival kit and a key aspect of our professional success. In a world where the rate at which knowledge is becoming available doubles every year, learning is changing itself from a verb to a skill. If we combine the rate of information growth with the little time we have to study and improve, we can realise that learning effectively is increasingly important.\n\nIn this talk I will share my experience as a continuous learner, the reasons that led me to improve and which approach I use nowadays."
