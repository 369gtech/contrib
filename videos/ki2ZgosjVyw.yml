description: "Antonio is a Java programmer and knows nothing about UI. He uses his Mac to develop Java EE micro-services, executes them with WildFly Swarm, packages them into Docker and exposes REST interfaces.\n\nSebastien is a TypeScript programmer and knows nothing about Java. Being a Microsoft employee he uses his PC to develop user interfaces with TypeScript and Angular2 to interact with the back-end.\n\nThis University is targeted at Java developers who want to discover TypeScript and how to use an Angular2 front-end with a Java back-end. It will be divided into three parts. 1) Develop Java EE micro-services using WildFly Swarm. 2) Discover the language TypeScript. 3) Create an Angular2 web interface using TypeScript to interact with the REST back-end.\n\nCome to this talk. You will see plenty of code and nice demos running on a Mac, a Windows machine…. and in the Cloud !\n\nAntonio Goncalves is a senior developer specialized in Java/Java EE. As a consultant he advises customers and helps them in defining and developing their software architecture.\n\nThis Java Champion is also the founder of the very successful Paris JUG, Devoxx France and an independent JCP member on various JSRs (Java EE 6, Java EE 7, Java EE 8).\n\nBased on his Java EE experiences, he has written three books covering Java EE 5, Java EE6 and recently Java EE 7.\n\nSebastien Pertus is a Technical Evangelist at Microsoft France.\n\nIts main activity is to help every community interested in innovating technologies from Microsoft.\n\nHe is mainly focus on XAML technologies, Azure, Open Source @ Microsoft, Visual Studio Code, TypeScript, .Net Core, SQL Server … and Java (sometimes) !\n\n[MBV-6308]"
