description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io\n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nDeploying stateful applications in Kubernetes can be a daunting task for those new to the storage landscape. Should a deployer choose block, file, object, or a database? What is volume? And can it be used by multiple applications simultaneously? Application persistence can be a complicated subject to understand.\n\nThe CNCF Storage SIG released the CNCF Storage Landscape white paper at Kubecon Shanghai and Seattle to help explain the options available, the storage attributes to be aware of and why these are important for different use cases. This will help an application developer choose the right storage solutions for persistence in their application.\n\nIn this webinar, CNCF Storage SIG will present an overview of storage technologies as explained in the white paper, and a technical overview of how storage is consumed by containerized stateful applications running in Kubernetes.\n\nThe whitepaper is available from the CNCF Storage SIG page: https://github.com/cncf/sig-storage"
