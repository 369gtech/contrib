And in most cases our daily activities and pursuits are focused on achieving that particular success. Success at work. Success at home. Success at school. Success in life! Goal:Pursuit:Achieve…Success!!! Well, it would be great if it was all that simple, but it’s not. Listen as Siobhan shares her story about her personal reorientation of what success is and how, today, she applies what she's learned to her work, her family and her life.\n\nSpeaker: Siobhan McFeeney, Leader of Transformation Practice, Pivotal"
