description: "Gathering data and useful information can be difficult without some tools in your toolbox. From managing fleets of sensors and devices to aggregating and making sense of the data, this domain is a new, unexplored world. Come to this session to learn how to collect and analyze data from large fleets of devices, using skills you have today. No bit-banging, no hardware interruptsâ€”this is the Internet of Things for mere mortals.\n\n\nAuthor:\nTim Kellogg\nTim is a software engineer at 2lemetry where he develops platform infrastructure for the Internet of Things. He has been a vocal member of the IoT community in contributing toward standards and enabling developers. He has written a book titled \"Mastering The Internet of Things\", released by Apress and frequently blogs at IoTWorld.com.\n\nOn the code side of the table, Tim primarily develops in Scala but is very excited about the new enhancements in Java 8.
