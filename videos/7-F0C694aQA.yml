description: "Part 2 of 2\n\nThis is an exclusive video of the live tutorial workshop presented at Velocity Conference 2012.\n\nTwo years ago, Velocity attendees watched as an unsuspecting website was subjected to automated optimization before their eyes in the workshop The 90-Minute Optimization Life Cycle (rated one of the top 10 sessions of Velocity 2010). This year, Hooman Beheshti is back, this time to demonstrate - in real time - the impact of advanced mobile optimization techniques on another unsuspecting website.\n\nOver the course of the workshop, you'll witness the mobile optimization life cycle, from start to finish:\n\n    Taking the \"Before\" shot: Choosing a guinea pig site and benchmarking its current performance, focusing on load time, start render time and round trips.\n    Iterating through core best practices, including: Keep-Alive, Compression, Far Future Expiry, and Use a CDN.\n    Applying a set of advanced, automated, mobile-specific FEO techniques.\n    Taking the \"After\" shot: Analyzing results using different browsers.\n\n\nAbout Hooman Beheshti\n\nWith over 15 years of experience working in the networking technology realm, Hooman is well versed in load balancing, application acceleration, and content delivery networks.
