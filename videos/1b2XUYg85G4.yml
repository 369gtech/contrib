description: "Slides: http://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/custom-tile-generation-in-pcf\n\nCloud Foundry is a highly-available Platform-as-a-Service that provides organizations a stable environment to host their applications. Pivotal Cloud Foundry also includes the concept of tiles, which provide functionality for other services. When installed, tiles gain the benefits of being managed by the PaaS such as reliability and high availability. Examples of these tiles include MySQL, RabbitMQ, and Spring Cloud Services. Administrators can generate brokered instances of these services which are then available to any application running in the PaaS.\n\nOrganizations often find themselves in the position of owning custom functionality (e.g. a payment processing service) that would best be implemented as a tile in the PCF installation. Pivotal has recently introduced a new tile generation utility, which makes the generation of custom tiles a practical endeavor. In this session, attendees will learn: the benefits of generating a tile, some of the criteria used to decide whether a tile or some other mechanism is best for your organization, a short demonstration of a tile generation utility provided by Pivotal, and how to operationalize the maintenance of a tile.\n\nSpeakers: Tom Collings; Senior Enterprise Architect, ECS Team. Dustin Ruehle; Director Integration, ECS Team."
