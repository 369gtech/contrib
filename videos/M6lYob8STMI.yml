description: "Get the Code Here: http://goo.gl/Zuatn\n\nWelcome to my tutorial on the Binary Tree in Java. On average a tree is more efficient then other data structures if you need to perform many different types of operations.\n\nIn this tutorial I'll show you what a binary tree is, and how to create, add, traverse and find nodes. I'll also explain all the terminology used when describing tree structures. We'll cover nodes, paths (edges), traversing and much more."
