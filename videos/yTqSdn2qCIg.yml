title: '2017 State of the rkt container runtime'
recordingDate: 1508619992
description: "https://media.ccc.de/c/asg2017/ASG2017-123-state_of_the_rkt_container_runtime\n\n\n\nrkt is a modern container runtime, built for security, efficiency, and composability. It is one of the container runtimes supported by Kubernetes but the current implementation (“rktnetes”) doesn’t support the Container Runtime Interface (CRI). The work-in-progress CRI implementation is called rktlet.\n\nThis presentation will give an update on the rkt project, what new features were implemented recently and what’s coming up. It will also give an update on the state of the rktlet: what features are missing and what workarounds should be removed before it becomes a complete implementation of the CRI.\n\n\n\nIago López Galeiras"
