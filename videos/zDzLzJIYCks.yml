description: "A startup cooperation with a bank is a chance for a massive success and – what is also likely – for an epic failure of the both sides. Listen to startups, who got through the path and learn from their and the bank’s experiences. Don’t try to talk to a bank without being prepared. Just listen to us, and learn from our real-life stories.\n\nPanel moderator: Paulina Skrzypińska\nPanelists: Łukasz Wachowicz, Michał Miszułowicz, Jagoda Pieścicka\n\nThe panel took place on 2018-05-22 at infoShare 2018 (Startup Stage) in Gdańsk.\n\nMore info: http://infoshare.pl \nFollow us: https://facebook.com/infosharepl\nhttps://twitter.com/infosharepl\nhttps://instagram.com/infoshare/\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/1272775/\nhttps://plus.google.com/+infoshare/"
