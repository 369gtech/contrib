title: 'Transparent Data Encryption - Advanced Use Cases Part 1'
language: English
recordingDate: 1579191208
description: "AskTom Database Security for January 2020 focuses on Transparent Data Encryption. Database Security Product Managers Rich Evans and Peter Wahl will lead this session, where we will discuss one of the more interesting TDE use cases, migrating TDE-enabled databases from wallet to Key Vault with minimal downtime, implementing separation of duties (between DBAs and OKV admins) along the way. We'll cover several different architectures - including Data Guard physical standby, single instance database, and multi-tenant database.\n\nThis is part 1 of several use-case focused sessions on Transparent Data Encryption (TDE). TDE is the most widely deployed Oracle Database security option, and is generally considered the foundation of a secure database system.  Most TDE use cases are simple to implement, but key management can sometimes trip up customers and implementers with nuances that may not be obvious.  For each of these sessions we'll be focusing on a few use cases, and walking through how to solve them, along with pitfalls to look out for.  If you work with Transparent Data Encryption, don't miss this session.\n\nAskTOM Office Hours offers free, monthly training and tips on how to make the most of Oracle Database, from Oracle product managers, developers and evangelists.\n\nhttps://asktom.oracle.com/\n\nOracle Developers portal: https://developer.oracle.com/\nSign up for an Oracle Cloud trial: https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/tryit"
