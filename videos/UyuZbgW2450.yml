recordingDate: 1391800961
description: "The human race is colonizing a second world—one with limitless connectivity, eternal memory, and frictionless access to information. It doesn't behave like the world we've lived in for millennia, and it demands new rules and norms.\n\nOur jungle-surplus wetware has a hard time keeping up with the pace of change, and the constant optimization of analytics is a global Skinner Box for experimentation and exploitation. We need to re-think what's right, what's polite, and what's legal in this new world.\n\nUnfortunately, legislation is decades behind reality, and online citizens are minting new policies for incrimination, anonymity, perversion, and community. In this online conference, we'll look at where ethics and the law are headed in an always-on, data-driven society.\n\nThe Spaghetti Fetish\n\nAlistair Croll\n\nAs we move online, the definition of a community changes. Our neighbors aren't just those people physically near us, but those we hang out with. This flexible definition of a community has serious repercussions for law and social morals: when we find kindred spirits online, we start thinking that everyone is just like us. At the same time, different communities hold us to different standards, and now that those communities leak into one another we need to apply context to our judgement.\n\nAbout Alistair Croll\n\nAlistair is the chair of O'Reilly's Strata conference, Techweb's Cloud Connect, and the International Startup Festival. \"Lean Analytics\" is his fourth book on analytics, technology, and entrepreneurship. He lives in Montreal, Canada and tries to mitigate chronic ADD by writing about far too many things at \"Solve For Interesting\".\nEthics of Big Data: Balancing Risk and Innovation\n\nKord Davis\n\nWhat are your organization's policies for generating and using huge datasets full of personal information?

While Privacy Risk Assessments & PIAs still mainly focus on the probability of being fined, the scope should be enlarged to take into consideration brand reputation & consumer trust.
