description: "Slides and more info: http://www.codemesh.io/codemesh2015/john-hughes\n\nKeynote: Why Functional Programming Matters\n\n25 years ago John Hughes published \"Why Functional Programming Matters\", a manifesto for FP--but the subject is much older than that! In this talk we'll take a deep dive into history to revisit our personal selection of highlights.\n\nAbout Mary\n\nProfessor at Chalmers University of Technology, GÃ¶teborg, Sweden and co-leader of the Functional Programming Group there. Mary has pioneered the use of functional domain specific languages in hardware design and verification, and in resource aware parallel programming. Founder member of IFIP Working Group 2.8 on Functional Programming.\nAbout John\n\nJohn Hughes has been a functional programming enthusiast for more than thirty years, at the Universities of Oxford, Glasgow, and since 1992 Chalmers University in Gothenburg, Sweden. He served on the Haskell design committee, co-chairing the committee for Haskell 98, and is the author of more than 75 papers, including \"Why Functional Programming Matters\", one of the classics of the area. With Koen Claessen, he created QuickCheck, the most popular testing tool among Haskell programmers, and in 2006 he founded Quviq to commercialise the technology using Erlang."
