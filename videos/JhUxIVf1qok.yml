description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2018\n—\nThere is One True Representation for signed integers, and that representation is two’s complement. There are, however, rumors of a fantasy world—before C++20—where ones' complement, signed magnitude and \"pure binary representations\" dwell. That world boasts Extraordinary Values, Padding Bits, and just like our world it hosts swaths of Undefined Behavior. \n\nJoin me in exploring this magnificent fantasy world, and discover its antics. Together we'll marvel at how the other representations were forever banished from real-world C++, doomed to cast mere shadows onto our reality.\n— \nJF Bastien, Compiler engineer\nApple\n\nJF is a compiler engineer. He leads C++ development at Apple.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
