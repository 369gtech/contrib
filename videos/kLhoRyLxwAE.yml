description: "Don't forget to check out our links below!\nhttps://ndcoslo.com/\nhttps://ndcconferences.com/\n\nClient-side web development has long been the sole domain of JavaScript. WebAssembly is changing that by opening up the web to the full ecosystem of languages, frameworks, and tools. ASP.NET Blazor is all about building modern web applications be that on the server or the client.\nIn this session I'll show you how to build beautiful and interactive client-side web UI, all with C# instead of JavaScript."
