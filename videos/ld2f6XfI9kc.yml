description: "In order to expand the functional programming community we must be able to effectively educate people about our craft; this presentation will offer some ideas for doing so. Possible teaching languages and approaches will be discussed generally before two experience reports are presented from FP workshops run this year: the NICTA Lambda Ladies Brisbane event and the Functional Programming in the Cloud session at Codemania New Zealand. The talk will touch on the use of cloud technologies for education and include a demonstration of creating a simple Haskell web application in the cloud.\n\nFor more on YOW!
