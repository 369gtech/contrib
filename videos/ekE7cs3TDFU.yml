description: "In this session, we will deep dive into important concepts and practices on making an environment \"production ready\" in Azure.\n\nEverything from infra provisioning, deployment, and security-hardening, to monitoring, reporting, operations, and process automation with integrations to various tools (both Azure-provided and Third Party).\nWe will begin by introducing a semi-complex \"sample application\" and demonstrate each concept/practice in a practical way, \"enriching the app\" step by step, so at the end, we will have our application ready for production.\n\nCheck out more of our talks at: \nhttps://ndcoslo.com\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/"
