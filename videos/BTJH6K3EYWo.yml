description: "There are some values in CSS that allow you to create shapes. For example, you can use the clip-path property and the circle() function to clip and element in a circle of your liking. A circle is a \"basic shape\" in CSS, just as it is in SVG, and you can use these basic shapes as values for a number of CSS properties. Basic shapes don't include \"path\" though, which is the ultimate vector defining syntax. In a strange twist, path() does exist in CSS, in places that don't support basic shapes!\n\nIn other words, itâ€™s complicated. In this session Chris will show you how to carefully navigate this minefield.\n\nSlides: https://css-tricks.com/conferences/cssday-june17-shapes.pdf\nAbout Chris: https://chriscoyier.net\n\nMore about CSS Day: https://cssday.nl or https://twitter.com/cssdayconf\nReceive conference announcements in your inbox: https://cssday.nl/subscribe"
