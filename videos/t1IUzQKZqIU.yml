title: 'MEEP: A New Java Profile for the Embedded World'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433784749
description: "For many years, IMP has been the Java profile for the embedded world, but it is not appropriate anymore for this dynamic market, which contains an increasing\nvariety of devices for very different purposes. More flexibility and a broader array of features and APIs are needed. The Java Microedition Embedded Profile (MEEP) aims to offer all this. Oracle is leading an effort to create this new profile to provide developers with new library APIs and embedded device manufacturers with the freedom to tailor the profile according to their needs. MEEP targets embedded devices such as wireless modules, smart meters, and healthcare monitoring and other M2M devices.\n\n\nAuthor:\nVolker Bauche\nVolker Bauche started working with Java soon after it became public, and from 1998 he is engaged in the JME area. As an employee of Siemens Mobile Phones, he was a specification lead for the Information Module Profile (IMP / JSR-195) and IMP-NG JSR (JSR-228), and later for the IMS Services API (JSR-281).\nIn 2007, he joined Sun Microsystems, being now an employee of the Oracle Corp. He worked in several Java standardization and prototyping projects in the mobile device, TV and JavaCard area. He is the specification lead of the JSR-361 for the new Microedition Embedded Profile (MEEP).\n\nView more trainings by Volker Bauche at https://www.parleys.com/author/volker-bauche\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
