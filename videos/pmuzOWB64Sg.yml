description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nFailure Stories From the On-premise Bare-metal World - Stephan Fudeus & David Meder-Marouelli, 1&1 Mail & Media Development & Technology GmbH \n\nSetting up a Kubernetes cluster is not trivial in general and doing that on-premise with bare-metal machines has very specific challenges. In addition to \"just\" defining the pod overlay network and embedding the host network into an existing topology, ingesting and directing traffic into the cluster is an essential task. Regardless of the chosen solution, compromises need to be made and eventually, failures will occur.  In this session David and Stephan will show their real world setup of reasonably large clusters (up to 150 nodes currently), the reasoning behind the network design and the failure stories they experienced and had to deal with. The topics are ranging from ingress controllers via BGP, network routing, DNS and iptables to hardware load balancer appliances - and how those technologies are not as cloud native as one might wish.\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zemo"
