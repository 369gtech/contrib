description: "(Laura Summers) How do we connect high-level fairness principles with day-to-day product decision making? How do we move past the AI Ethics hype and start trying, testing and implementing practical approaches? In this talk the presenter will share stories, discoveries, and pointers from their time as an ‘ethics ops’ consultant embedded with a small fraud detection team in a big telco. From improving the science bit of data science, to developing the collective sensitivity of the team, to designing recourse for false positives, tune in for pragmatic pointers and actionable take-aways.\n\nhttps://pretalx.com/pycon-au-2021/talk/RKHXBF/\n\npython, pycon, australia, programming, conference, technical, pyconline, developers, panel, sessions, libraries, frameworks, community, sysadmins, students, education, data, science\n\nVideos licensed as CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0\r\n\r\nPyCon AU is the national conference for the Python programming community, bringing together professional, student and enthusiast developers, sysadmins and operations folk, students, educators, scientists, statisticians, and many others besides, all with a love for working with Python.\r\n\r\nPyCon AU informs the country’s Python developers with presentations, tutorials and panel sessions by experts and core developers of Python, as well as the libraries and frameworks that they rely on.\n\nProduced by Next Day Video Australia: https://nextdayvideo.com.au\n\nFri Sep 10 09:30:00 2021 at Science, Data & Analytics"
