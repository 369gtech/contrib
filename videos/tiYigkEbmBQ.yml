title: 'GeeCON 2019: Bruno Bossola - An overview of available opensource tools to secure your Java code'
recordingDate: 1563984001
description: 'When you want to secure your code there are a variety of tools that you can use, each of them dedicated to a specific stage in the project lifecycle. Of course, there are static code analysis tools (SAST) that you can use sometimes even on your editor, but what about SIS? DAST? IAST? WAF? And, wait, are you still using *just* prepared statements and not a RASP solution? Do not be scared of all these acronyms! Learn which opensource tools are available now, which ones are on the frontier, and what are the techniques available. After a 20 minutes introduction with slides, we will install and run plenty of them, live, so that hopefully you will be able to use them the next day yourself!'
