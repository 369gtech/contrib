description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.    \n\nKeynote: SIG-Honk AMA Panel: Hacking and Hardening in the Cloud Native Garden - Ian Coldwater, Independent; Duffie Cooley, Independent; Brad Geesaman, Co-Founder, Darkbit; & Rory McCune, Principal Consultant\n\nHave you ever wondered how hackers think? What do attackers look for when they approach a cluster, and what security hardening steps can stop them in their tracks? Join Ian Coldwater, Brad Geesaman, Rory McCune, and Duffie Cooley for an AMA panel session. This group of friends and longtime Kubernetes security SMEs bring their unique perspectives and experience with securing, attacking, and deploying cloud native infrastructure to form ”sig-HONK,” an unofficial Special Interest Group focused on changing the way we think about and practice security in distributed systems.   How does this group of people come up with ideas as to what to hack next, and how do they go about doing it? What’s all this honking about, anyway?  Come learn the answers to these questions and anything else you have in mind. Ask Us Anything! \n\nhttps://sched.co/eoIZ"
