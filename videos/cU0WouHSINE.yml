description: "An Experimentation and Analytics Framework for Large-Scale AI Operations Platforms\n\nThomas Rausch, TU Wien; Waldemar Hummer and Vinod Muthusamy, IBM Research AI\n\nThis paper presents a trace-driven experimentation and analytics framework that allows researchers and engineers to devise and evaluate operational strategies for large-scale AI workflow systems. Analytics data from a production-grade AI platform developed at IBM are used to build a comprehensive system and simulation model. Synthetic traces are made available for ad-hoc exploration as well as statistical analysis of experiments to test and examine pipeline scheduling, cluster resource allocation, or similar operational mechanisms.\n\nView the full OpML '20 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/opml20/program"
