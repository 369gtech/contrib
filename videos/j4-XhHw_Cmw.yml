description: "SQL Assessment API provides a mechanism to evaluate the configuration of your SQL Server for best practices. The API is delivered with a ruleset containing best practice rules suggested by SQL Server Team. This ruleset is enhancing with the release of new versions but at the same time, the API is built with the intent to give a highly customizable and extensible solution. So, users can tune the default rules and create their own ones. The API can be used to assess SQL Server versions 2012 and higher and Azure SQL Managed Instance.\n\nIn this episode with Aaron Nelson, we‚Äôll show you the basics of the SQL Assessment PowerShell commands, and how you can run the assessments for your Azure SQL Managed Instances as well as your on-prem SQL Server instances.\n\n0:00 Introduction\n1:23 Intro to SQL Assessment checks\n2:19 Demo: SQL Assessment checks\n9:08 Getting started\n\n‚úîÔ∏èResources:\nSQL Server Samples: https://github.com/microsoft/sql-server-samples/tree/master/samples/manage/sql-assessment-api?WT.mc_id=dataexposed-c9-niner\n\nüìå Let's connect:\nTwitter: Aaron Nelson, https://twitter.com/SQLvariant\nTwitter: Anna Hoffman, https://twitter.com/AnalyticAnna\nTwitter: AzureSQL, https://aka.ms/azuresqltw\n\nüî¥ To check out even more Data Exposed episodes, see our playlist: https://aka.ms/dataexposedyt\n\nüîî Subscribe to our channels for even more SQL tips:\nMicrosoft Azure SQL: https://aka.ms/msazuresqlyt\nMicrosoft SQL Server: https://aka.ms/mssqlserveryt\nMicrosoft Developer:  https://aka.ms/microsoftdeveloperyt\n\n#AzureSQL #AzureSQLMI #AzureSQLManagedInstance #SQLAssessment"
