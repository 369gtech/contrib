Is your Risk & Control leadership fostering the right climate for learning about new risks, new mitigations and adaptable controls? Or are Risk & Control holding back speed?Are your product teams learning how to be risk aware? Is there safety within safety? In this talk, Jon will share Antipatterns and Patterns, from implementing Speed AND Control at large, traditional, old, horses not unicorns. This talk includes interviews with Compliance professionals, played by actors, giving the private, inside view of what it’s like for them prior to after change, which you would not normally hear spoken about.\n\nDOES19 Las Vegas\nDOES 2019 US\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
