Variadic templates specifically are still a new, relatively unknown and at the same time quite a buggy (in the sense of bugs in their implementations) tool, but nevertheless, they offer much easier ways of creating truly generic types and functions. \n\nThis talk will focus slightly less on variadic templates in general; the common pitfalls will be discussed, but more attention will be given to the tool of parameter pack expansion and all the contexts where it can be used, especially as a code generation tool. \n\nThe talk will start mostly from scratch, assuming the audience's general knowledge about templates. It'll introduce the idea of variadic templates and general syntax and typical techniques for their use. Next, it will head into the (mostly) unknown and buggy lands of the interesting uses of variadic packs, like unpacking a tuple into a function call using `std::integer_sequence`, the use of empty packs for a slightly easier way to work with `enable_if`. The final examples will explain the way of invoking an expression per every argument in a pack, and dispatch to appropriate version of code for each of the argument types based on runtime values, which will be used to more easily create variant visitors. \n— \nMichał Dominiak\nSoftware Engineer, Nokia Networks\nBachelor of Engineering in Computer Science, studied at Faculty of Electronics at Wrocław University of Technology. Loves metaprogramming and doing as much as possible during compile time, instead of wasting precious cycles at runtime.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
