description: "If you're a programmer and looking to decide which laptop to get in 2019, I've developed a set of recommendations for you based on 3 different budgets! In this episode, I'll explain my recommendations for the best laptop for programmers in the student, generalist, and professional category. Each of my picks has been judged by me on a wide variety of factors from GPU speed to keyboard comfort to cooling fan ability. These are my own picks, none of these companies paid me to promote them. I hope you find my set of recommendations useful in your journey, enjoy! \n\nIt would mean so much to me if you subscribe to my YouTube Channel! https://bit.ly/2SvhG7v\n\nAcer Nitro 5 $650-750 (Student Laptop):\nhttps://amzn.to/2KnOkV0\n\nDell XPS 15 $1250+ (Generalist Laptop):\nhttps://amzn.to/2KpmFTz\n\nRazer Blade $1500-3000 (Professional Laptop):\nhttps://amzn.to/2YIuJDY\n\nMy desktop build $1600:\nhttps://pcpartpicker.com/list/VdtNyX\n\nLacie Storage Device:\nhttps://amzn.to/2YIveOm\n\nWatch Me Build Startups:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeraUtRgsbI&list=PL2-dafEMk2A4n3aP_rzgqA8lVGknkSN2p\n\nINSTAGRAM: https://bit.ly/312pLUb\nFACEBOOK: https://bit.ly/2OqOhx1\nTWITTER: https://bit.ly/2OHYLbB\nWEBSITE: https://bit.ly/2OoVPQF\n\nJoin us in the Wizards Slack channel:\nhttp://wizards.herokuapp.com/\n\nHit the Join button above to sign up to become a member of my channel for access to exclusive live streams!\n\nJoin us at the School of AI:\nhttps://theschool.ai/\n\nSignup for my newsletter for exciting updates in the field of AI:\nhttps://goo.gl/FZzJ5w\n\nAnd please support me on Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/user?u=3191693"
