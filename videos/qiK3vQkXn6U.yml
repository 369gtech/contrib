recordingDate: 1477383919
description: "In the eyes of a lot of people, \"the stereotypical developer\" is an introvert, who spends all of his or her time in front of a computer, communicates poorly, is socially awkward, unreliable, wears esoteric T-shirts and has an addiction to caffeine.\n\nOf course, this is not (all) true, but as developers our coding skills far outweigh our \"soft\" skills. So, what do we, as developers, need to do to improve on these skills?\nMahesh Krishnan, draws upon his years of experience as a developer and consultant to talk about these skills, and what you need to do to get them. He will provide you with tools and tips to help you with your confidence, communication skills, time management skills, how to resolve conflict, etc; and also what you need to do to advance both your technical and leadership skills."
