description: "Pose estimation is a pretty fun machine learning problem to work on and with Tensorflow.js anyone can implement their own pose estimation algorithm that works in the browser with just a few lines of code. In this video i'll go over some of tensorflow.js' interesting features, compare it to other frameworks, then go into the history and algorithmic detail of the pose estimation algorithm. We'll end the video with me programming a pose estimation algorithm in javascript. \n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/pose_estimation\n\nPlease Subscribe! And like. And comment.
