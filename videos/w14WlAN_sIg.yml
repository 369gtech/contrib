description: "Andy Smith \n\nSenior Core Developer, Rackspace\n \nProbably better known as \"termie,\" Andy Smith is an open source, uppity, Python programmer from way back who has tried to dabble in everything else along the way. Lately his work focuses on building the infrastructure for quote, the cloud, unquote, with OpenStack but prior to that he built the platform layer at Google App Engine, and before that the application layer at Jaiku and before that the client side at Flock. Notable side projects include OAuth and BarCamp. Before that he worked on MUDs and he wants to do that again. Buying him beer is a good way to find out what he really thinks."
