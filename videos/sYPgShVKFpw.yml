description: "Community Architect, Community Cultivator, and Customer development at brands including Zappos, UserVoice, and Seesmic.\r\n\r\nWhile he has a technical background, he prefers to speak in gardening and architecture metaphors. He is inspired by storytelling, psychology, evangelism, architectural theory, social economics, game mechanics, cultural anthropology, compassion, and ants.\r\n\r\nHe was studying to become a missionary, but left that path because he grew tired of the business of religion. Now, he helps businesses convert customers into communities of evangelists.\r\n\r\nOh, and he loves his internet friends, and falls in love with almost everyone he meets."
