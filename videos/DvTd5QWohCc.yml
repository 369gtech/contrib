title: 'Database In-Memory Vectorized Joins in 21c'
language: English
recordingDate: 1630110459
description: 'AskTOM Office Hours offers free, open Q&A sessions with Oracle Database experts. Explore the Database In-Memory option with Andy Rivenes (@TheInMemoryGuy) and Maria Colgan (@SQLMaria). In this session we took a deeper dive into a new 21c feature that speeds up Hash Joins called In-Memory Vectorized Joins. We showed IM vectorized joins in action with and without Join Groups and also with Bloom filtering. We also showed how to verify the use of IM vectorized joins with system statistics and SQL Monitor active reports.'
