description: "In this talk, I will show and explain an architecture as well as a bunch of applications built on it where a mobile client as well as further clients talk only to a Riak distributed data store, avoiding any special sort of \"classic\" business backend. There are several (technical) use cases/challenges to be covered, starting with immediate or locally buffered writes, distributed analysis etc. All around Riak store, all having quite interesting scalability and availability considerations.\n\nMore Info: https://2012.berlinbuzzwords.de/sessions/hand-mouth\n\nDescription of Pavlo Baron: https://2012.berlinbuzzwords.de/content/pavlo-baron"
