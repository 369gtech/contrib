description: "You are very careful about protecting your valuables. On the computer, how do you make sure you’re letting only safe processes run? The Java platform has long been trusted as being safe, so people often allow risky applications to execute. This session provides an overview of recent user interface and interaction changes that take into account the latest security measures that enable users to make more-informed choices. The changes have been incorporated into all aspects of the Java lifecycle, including install, update, configuration, app deploy, browser plug-in, uninstall, and help. The session is also meant to be an opportunity to ask questions and provide feedback to Oracle on the evolution of the Java platform as a more secure place to deploy applications.\n\n\nAuthors:\nAshishkumar Tibrewala\nAshish joined the Java user experience team recently.
