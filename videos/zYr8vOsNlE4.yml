description: "In Norigin Media we are developing TV Streaming Apps for all relevant platforms (pretty much everything where it is possible to stream videos). After many years of doing these kind of Apps we've tried to find common patterns between different Players, UX patterns for TV Apps, Tracking/Analytics systems and other common issues that we had to deal with over and over again. We abstracted and isolated many of them into a small reusable and replaceable modules and built an in-house ecosystem that allows us to improve our crossplatform development process and make developers' lives easier. We care a lot about Developer Experience, which is the main motivation for us to build such a tools and solutions.\n\nAbout the speaker\nI am a Frontend Engineer at Norigin Media, working on crossplatform TV Streaming Apps and in-house SDK components.
