description: "This video was recorded at Scala Days Chicago 2017\nFollow us on Twitter @ScalaDays or visit our website for more information http://scaladays.org \n\nAbstract: \nTo understand a piece of program text one must also understand the con-text in which the program is to be executed. Modern programming languages offer an array of constructs to define context. In Scala, those constructs can be summed up as the three I's: Imports, Inheritance, and Implicits. Implicits in particular are a central, but also controversial part of the language.\n\nThis talk explores the different facets of implicits in Scala, as they exist now and as they might evolve in the future. It highlights their potential benefits and problems, covering aspects of design, implementation, and ergonomics."
