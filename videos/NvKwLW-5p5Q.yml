description: "Visit the largest developers congress in Europe: WeAreDevelopers World Congress, 16 - 18 May 2018 in Vienna, Austria.\n\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/congress/\n\nReact Native is a big improvement for developing cross-platform mobile applications, and paved the way for web-application developers. Using Javascript, it transfers known concepts and patterns directly to the world of mobile apps.\nBut which aspects of modern web application development apply, and which issues will React developers face when working with React Native? At 25th floor, we went through this transition, from web to mobile, and built a cross-platform application running on iOS and Android from zero to App Store release in just 3 months.\nIâ€™ll outline our journey to the first public release and beyond, share our experience, the pitfalls we encountered and the solutions we discovered.\n\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/wearedevelopers.org/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/wearedevs/\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/wearedevelopers.org/"
