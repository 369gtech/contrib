What if I tell you that we can use the latest Web APIs and still offer an inclusive and accessible experience.\n\nIn this talk, you'll learn how to combine Web APIs such as Speech Recognition and Geolocation, with performant Javascript techniques to create empathic user interfaces.\n\nA self-educated UI Developer working at SinnerSchrader. As part of the product engineering team, he works as a proxy between the design and engineering teams. You’ll find him in that sweet spot where art meets science. Using technology to craft user-centric experiences. He’s currently also leading the educational program module 'Modern Software Development' at SinnerSchrader.
