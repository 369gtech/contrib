title: 'GopherCon 2018: Kavya Joshi - The Scheduler Saga'
language: English
recordingDate: 1537106772
description: "he Go scheduler is the behind-the-scenes magical machine that powers Go programs. It efficiently runs goroutines, and also coordinates network IO and memory management.\n\nKavyaâ€™s talk will explore the inner workings of the scheduler machinery. She will delve into the M:N multiplexing of goroutines on system threads, and the mechanisms to schedule, unschedule, and rebalance goroutines. Kavya will also touch upon how the scheduler supports the netpoller and the memory management systems for goroutine stack resizing and heap garbage collection. Finally, she will evaluate the effectiveness and performance of the scheduler."
