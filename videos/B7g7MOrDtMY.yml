language: English
recordingDate: 1525205548
description: "The ability to create Vue components as small decoupled units is necessary for the organization of applications. With this, parent-child and sibling-sibling components need to interact and manage information among each other. This is where it becomes incredibly important to have appropriate state management for predictability and maintainability of your entire application.\n\nThis talk will cover how to manage data between components, what ‘custom events’ are and the cons associated with using them, how to use a small global store for simple state management and finally, why Vuex is the most appropriate method for managing state for medium to large applications.\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc\n\nSave 10% off any FITC event with discount code 'youtube'.\nSee our upcoming events at www.fitc.ca"
