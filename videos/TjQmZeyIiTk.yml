description: "Many exciting things are happening with AI, from which, until recently, JavaScript developers were mostly shut out. However, things are changing. If you can do npm install @tensorflow/tfjs or make an API call, you can now do AI. \n\nIn this fast-paced talk, I'll open your mind to what's possible by demoing several AI-powered JavaScript apps and show you how I built them using either TensorFlow.js or easy to use AI-powered APIs. You don't need a PhD in Maths. You don't need years of experience. You just need imagination and the willingness to try.\n\nEVENT:\n\nDevFest Ukraine 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nAsim Hussain\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nDevFest Ukraine Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nDevFest YouTube channel: http://bit.ly/devfest-channel\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgoVL3A6RCo&t=76s"
