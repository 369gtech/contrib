description: "Humans navigate a world made up of places with names, addresses and phone numbers—not lat/long coordinates. The Google Places API enables an app or website to present location data to users in a human-centered fashion. In this session we do a deep dive into how you can use the Places API to discover your environment. We give detailed insights into how to use these on web and mobile, show off some newly-released widgets, and take a look at how you can optimize for mobile device battery life. You’ll learn how the Places API can make all your apps -- not just map-centric ones -- smarter.\n\nSee all the talks from Google I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/olw6kV\nWatch more Android talks at I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/Uv3jls\nWatch more Chrome talks at I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/JoMLpB\nWatch more Firebase talks at I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/JTH9Fr \nSubscribe to the Google Developers Channel: http://goo.gl/mQyv5L \n\n#io16 #GoogleIO #GoogleIO2016"
