description: "Speaker: Lynus Hee\r\n\r\nSo it has all happened to us before. You invest in a vacation to a nice scenic location, got all your camera gear with you and all you get is overcast skies and bland lighting. You spend hours tracking up a hill and the sunset is mediocre at best. So is there a way to avoid these disappointments and predict when you will get a beautiful sunrise or sunset?\r\n\r\nLynus Hee will share his experience in chasing some of the most beautiful sunrises and sunsets around the world. He will explain the key weather indicators to look out for, the techniques he uses and most importantly to get to know more fellow photographers who love chasing sunsets like he does.\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.facebook.com/events/1760268557610733\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/c91j/"
