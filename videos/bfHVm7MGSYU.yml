description: "Here’s the use case. You learn of a problem with a government system or some technology, and you want to do the right thing. You want to get the information into the right hands, but you’d be more comfortable sharing if you knew you couldn’t be identified as the messenger of the problem. Sound familiar?\n\nThis very problem has been the subject of a years-long conversation in the space between government and independent security research. The goal is to create a sturdy, anonymous system for hackers and researchers that shares your tip directly with the part of government that needs to know, and keeps you out of the equation. This is your chance to be part of the conversation. Join The Dark Tangent, the NYT’s Runa Sandvik, Leviathan’s Corbin Souffrant, SOFWERX and The Donovan Groups Pablo Breuer, the ACLU’s Jennifer Granick and the DHS CISA Christopher Krebs and have your voice heard.\n\nCorbin Souffrant\nCorbin Souffrant is a Security Consultant with Leviathan Security Group where his expertise spans several security domains. He has engaged in projects involving everything from firmware and device security, to application assessments, and even fuzzer development. Prior to this, he participated as a competitor in DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge (CGC), researched program analysis tooling, and reverse-engineered exploits from active malware samples.\n\nTwitter: @loliponi\n\nPablo Breuer\nPablo Breuer is currently the director of US Special Operations Command Donovan Group and senior military advisor and innovation officer to SOFWERX.

In the absence of a permanent NPPD Under Secretary at the time, Mr. Krebs took on the role of serving as the Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Under Secretary for NPPD until he was subsequently nominated as the Under Secretary and confirmed by the Senate the following year.\n\nTwitter: @CISAKrebs Website: https://www.dhs.gov/person/christopher-c-krebs\n\n Runa Sandvik\nRuna Sandvik is the Director of Information Security for the Newsroom at The New York Times.
