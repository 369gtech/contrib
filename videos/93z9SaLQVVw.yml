description: "Webassembly is considered as the future of the web. We will explore why!\n\nWe'll start with short history of Webassembly and why it is not the reincarnation of Applets/Flash/NaCl.\n\nWe will then see how this technology can be used in the Java world from cross compilation to web web frameworks.\n\nOf course, we will not leave aside the Kotlin language, and how it interacts with the Webassembly."
