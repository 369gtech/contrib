title: '"Sacrebleu - PowerShell on Linux!" - Kieran Jacobsen (LCA 2021 Online)'
recordingDate: 1612098737
description: "Kieran Jacobsen\n\nhttps://lca2021.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/76/\n\nMicrosoft open-sourced PowerShell in 2016, and debuted a cross-platform interaction supporting Linux and MacOS. Since then, thousands have contributed to the PowerShell project, with the community growing exponentially. Linux users now outpace other platforms in downloading PowerShell modules and scripts from the PowerShell Gallery.\r\n\r\nWith PowerShell 7.1, the community and Microsoft have delivered more features and bug fixes than ever before. In this session, we will work through some of the new features and improvements included in this release.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/\n\nProduced by Next Day Video Australia: https://nextdayvideo.com.au\n\n#linux.conf.au #linux #foss #opensource\n\nMon Jan 25 13:30:00 2021 at Pia Andrews Conservatory"
