description: "Speaker: Loh Li Wei\n\nSynopsis: Data.gov.sg was launched in 2011 as the Singapore government's one-stop portal to its open data. The new data.gov.sg, now in public beta, goes beyond being a data repository. It aims to make government data relevant and understandable to the public, through the active use of charts and articles. We will discuss the key features on the new data.gov.sg, such as real-time APIs, dashboards, data blog and the recently released developers portal. We will also share on our data quality guide, which will assist government agencies in converting their data from human-readable report formats into reusable, machine-readable formats.\n\nSpeaker: Loh Li Wei is an associate consultant in IDA's Data Science Division, focusing on data-driven narratives and open data standards. He is part of a five-member team currently working on the new data.gov.sg portal. \n\nEvent Page: http://www.meetup.com/PyData-SG/events/229711618/\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/YEAX/"
