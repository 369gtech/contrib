description: "Google TechTalks\nJuly 11, 2006\n\nTore Risch\n\nABSTRACT\nGSDM is a data stream management system running on cluster computers. The system is extensible through user-defined data representations and computations. The computations are specified as stream queries continuously computed over windows of data sliding over the streams.\n\nOur applications include a virtual radio telescope requiring advanced computations over huge streams of data. The system needs to be highly scalable w.r.t. both data and computations. Rather than providing only built-in distribution strategies, the system allows the user to define distribution templates to specify customized distribution strategies for user functions in..."
