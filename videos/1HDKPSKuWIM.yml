description: "by Mario Behling\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/H.2213/psl.webm\n\nIn this talk we will cover the development path of the Pocket Science Lab (PSLab) board from version one in 2014 to today and outline how we use tools like KiCad to bring the device to large scale production. We will also share some major issues that we solved to get the device manufacturing ready and challenges that lie ahead of us like ensuring thorough device testing at production. In this talk we will cover the development path of the Pocket Science Lab (PSLab) board from version one in 2014 to today and outline how we use tools like KiCad to bring the device to large scale production. We will also share some major issues that we solved to get the device manufacturing ready and challenges that lie ahead of us like ensuring thorough device testing at production. The goal of Pocket Science Lab is to create an Open Source hardware device (open on all layers) and software applications that can be used for experiments. The tiny pocket lab provides an array of instruments for doing science and engineering experiments. It provides functions of numerous measurement tools including an oscilloscope, a waveform generator, a frequency counter, a programmable voltage, current source and even a component to control robots with up to four servos.\n\nRoom: H.2213\nScheduled start: 2020-02-01 12:20:00"
