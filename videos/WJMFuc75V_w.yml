title: 'Is IT ready for the Dreaded DNA Data Deluge?'
recordingDate: 1225478559
description: "Google Tech Talks\nOctober 30, 2008\n\nABSTRACT\n\nIn 18 months full human genome sequences will be available under $100 - and in minutes. The $5,000 full human genome was announced to come in 9 months. Is \"Big IT\" ready for the avalanche of data, to be obtained and processed e.g. while the patient is still on the operating table, to be diagnosed, and how the genomics glitch, that caused a benign or malign tumor, could be compensated for?\n\nAlgorithmic approaches are needed to better understand genome regulation, even for the simple reason to deploy most effective data retrieval, data storage and computational means, via both parallel hardware and software, but more importantly for opening entirely new perspectives.\n\nIn the 100+ year old Genomics, for over half a Century had us to resign to the fatalistic gloom that we are stuck with any glitches in our inherited genome. Is it true that genomic glitches doom one to \"incurable\" hereditary diseases?\n\nNo longer. Genomics now considers the DNA-RNA-Protein chain not as a thermodynamically closed system, where entropy increases, but as an open system that can be interfered with. There is theoretically sound hope that you are not stuck with your genomic glitches.\n\nAfter half a Century of sticking to two mistaken axioms of Genomics, the paradigm of recursive genome function must quickly make up for lost time for those (potentially) inflicted with formerly \"incurable\" diseases. \"The Genome baby is left on the doorsteps of Information Technology\".\n\nDoctors sent those inflicted with fleece for \"debugging\". Debugging genome information (by Genome Computers) would be much harder without understanding the algorithms that our natural genome computing operates with.\n\nSpeaker: Dr. Andras Pellionisz\nPh.D. in Biology\nPh.D. in Computer Engineering\nDirector of Genome Informatics, Mitrionics, Inc., Los Gatos, California\nEuropean Union visiting Professor for Hungary (for \"European Inaugural of IPGS\")\nFounder of International PostGenetics Society (IPGS,PostModern era of Genetics \"beyond Genes\")\nFounder of FractoSoft (Software for PostGenetics, Silicon Valley, with Central European outsourcing)\nFounder of Helixometry (IP portfolio holding, Silicon Valley)\nInventor and Founder of FractoGene (Fractal approach to DNA)\nChief Software Architect and Chief Intelligence Officer of several Silicon Valley Internet Companies in the dot.com boom\nFounder of International Neural Networks Society (INNS)\nFounding Editor of Neural Networks (publication organ of INNS)\nSection Editor for Neural Networks of The Cerebellum (Springer, New York & Heidelberg)\nProfessor of Physiology and Biophysics, New York University Medical Center\nVisiting Professor of Marburg University, Germany (Humboldt Prize for Senior Distinguished Amercian Scientists)\nVisiting Professor of UMR/CNRS, College de France, Paris\nSenior Research Council Associate of the National Academy of Science, USA, to NASA\nPostDoctoral Fellow, University of Iowa\nPostDoctoral Fellow, Stanford University\nTenured Senior Research Fellow of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences"
