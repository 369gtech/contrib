description: "Ozan Gunalp\nSoftware Architect\nLesFurets.com\n\nGilles Di Guglielmo\nSoftware Designer\nLesFurets.com\n\nWith the dOOv framework, we are trying to solve a common problem with software: performance vs. readability vs. type-safety. Since Java 8, lambdas offer the ability to compose functions at runtime with high performance. We built a fluent API using lambdas to write validation and mapping logic with a DSL. It enables the written application rules to be introspected and profiled by visiting the DSL abstract syntax tree at runtime. During this BOF we will discuss how the framework is designed, the issues that we encountered generating the natural language output, failure cause analysis, and AST rewriting."
