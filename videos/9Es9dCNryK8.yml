description: "Containers are enabling developers to package their applications (and underlying dependencies) in new ways that are portable and work consistently everywhere? On your machine, in production, in your data center, and in the cloud. And Docker has become the de facto standard for those portable containers in the cloud.\nDocker is the developer-friendly Linux container technology that enables creation of your stack: OS, JVM, app server, app, and all your custom configuration. So with all it offers, how comfortable are you and your team taking Docker from development to production? Are you hearing developers say, “But it works on my machine!” when code breaks in production?"
