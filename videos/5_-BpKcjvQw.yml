recordingDate: 1636975918
description: "Despite having so much uncertainty around us, we are continually pressured to commit to delivery dates. Let’s face it. That pressure is going nowhere. Now is the time to put away the dread and learn how to not only accept uncertainty, but operate, and even thrive, within it.\n\nThis talk helps you understand why uncertainty is here to stay and how you can make sense of it with your data to make informed and risk-aware forecasts. You’ll also take away a few simple steps you can take regularly to stabilize your system, become more predictable and make those forecasts even better.\n\nRecorded live on 9 September 2021 at P3X — People Product Process eXchange 2021"
