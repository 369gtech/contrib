From classic PONG and a \"Simon says\" device to a pocket gaming console, and some other surprises. We'll end with an Open LED Race competition and the possibility to win hardware and make your our TinyGo device.\n\n\nThis talk will feature bright lights and sounds, maybe lasers too.\n\nRoom: UB2.252A (Lameere)\nScheduled start: 2020-02-02 09:30:00"
