description: "Keynote by Steve Rosenbaum, Founder and CEO of Magnify.net.\n\nSteve Rosenbaum\n\nMagnify.net\n\nSteven Rosenbaum is an entrepreneur, author, and curator. He is the founder and CEO of the web's largest Video Curation Platform, Magnify.net. Rosenbaum is known as the father of user-generated video, having created MTV's groundbreaking UGC series MTV UNfiltered, a pre-web television project that handed cameras to young storytellers. Since that time he has built a career finding, organizing, and curating first-person storytelling.\n\nRosenbaum's work as an Emmy Award winning documentary filmmaker includes his film chronicling 9/11 \"7 Days In September.\" That film gathered more than 500 hours of video around 9/11 -- creating a curated journey through the eyes of 28 filmmakers and citizen storytellers. The result was the curation of the world's largest collection of 9/11 videos: The CameraPlanet Archive which Rosenbaum and producing partner Pamela Yoder donated to the National 9/11 Memorial and Museum. His film work includes long form documentary projects for National Geographic, HBO, CNN, MSNBC, Discovery, A&E, and The History Channel.\n\nAs a blogger, Rosenbaum contributes to posts on Technology, Internet Video, and emerging digital lifestyle trends to FastCompany, The Huffington Post, Silicon Alley Insider, Mashable, TechCrunch, and MediaBizBloggers.\n\nToday, Rosenbaum calls Curation the \"New Magic\" of the connected world -- fixing the signal to noise problem, and making the world contextual and coherent again.\n\nHis forthcoming book Curation Nation, explores the changing worlds of publishing, consumer content, and brand-centric curation. It will be published by McGraw Hill on March 11th, 2011."
