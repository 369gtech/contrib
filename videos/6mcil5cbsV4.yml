description: "Only the penitent man shall pass. The three trials that guard the Grail of software development Part I.\n\nIn this session hosted by Data Engineer Javier Mart√≠nez, we are going to have a practical hands-on session while discovering the relevance of testing at any stage of software development.\n\nThe goal is to increase our agility and understanding on developing code through testing. It will be an interactive session where we will go through different examples that build up step by step our understanding on testing in software development.\n\nRepository dedicated to testing in Python: https://gitlab.com/jmaralc/testing_python\n\nTo catch up all our events, please visit our: https://codurance.com/events"
