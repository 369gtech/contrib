description: "Presented at droidcon Italy 2020\n\nADVANCED BLUETOOTH FOR ANDROID DEVELOPERS\nMartin Woolley, Developer Relations Manager, Bluetooth\n\nBluetooth has changed enormously since its initial release about twenty years ago. Communication can now take place over distances in excess of a kilometre. It’s twice as fast as it used to be and connectionless communication through broadcasting data to an unlimited number of receivers has become extremely versatile and powerful. Oh and did you know, you can also create secure networks of tens of thousands of smart devices using Bluetooth?\nAll of these advanced capabilities are there for Android developers to exploit. Come to this session for a guided tour of the most interesting and advanced Bluetooth features from an Android developer’s perspective.\n\nhttps://it.droidcon.com/2020/​​​​\nhttps://twitter.com/Droidconit​​​​\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/showcase/dro​​​​...\nhttps://www.instagram.com/droidconit/​​​​\nhttps://www.facebook.com/droidconIt"
