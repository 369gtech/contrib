Communications and observability of modern systems have become just as important as the deployment of the components themselves. In this talk maintainers of the NATS projectwill create a service using NATS as the communication technology. They will show how NATS allows a service application to utilize cutting edge security with the ability to scale up and down, across multiple Kubernetes clusters and cloud deployments. This will be completely observable, with no code changes from the demo code base to global deployment. NATS allows cutting edge modern systems to be built without the additional complexity of load balancers, proxies or sidecars. NATS allows radically easy yet secure deployments across multiple k8s clusters, in any cloud or on-premise environment. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UakY"
