description: "Slides: http://pag.forbeslindesay.co.uk\nI will talk about how ES6 generators can help you make your asynchronous code easier to understand in terms of synchronous concepts. I will discuss the alternative values you can use to represent a future and how they are all ultimately promises. Finally, I will discuss how you can get some of the same benefits in thought processes by using promises today.\n\nSource: http://2013.jsconf.eu/speakers/forbes-lindesay-promises-and-generators-control-flow-utopia.html\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
