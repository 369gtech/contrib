description: "DevDay (http://devday.pl)\n26th of September 2014\n\nPeter Smith - \"It Doesn't Work That Way in Enterprise\"\n\n\" We've all heard it... or something similar. There's probably one senior guy at work who tells you this at least once a month. You've got an idea for an amazing new feature or practice that's going to save your company both time and money, but it's too 'cutting edge'; your management fears the unfamiliar and you are cruelly stifled.\n\n\"It doesn't work like that in Enterprise\" is a passionate and motivational story about my journey as a developer in the face of one of the worst fallacies in our industry. The extremes of my experience will make you laugh & cry in equal measure, and maybe help put your own frustrations into perspective. Just remember, it does get better... and you probably got off very f***g lightly!\""
