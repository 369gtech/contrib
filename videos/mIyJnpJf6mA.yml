recordingDate: 1623258113
description: "AppSec Fundamentals for Modern DevOps\n\nSuchakra Sharma and Vickie Li, ShiftLeft Inc.\n\nThe complexity of modern applications and their deployments means that DevOps needs to wear the security hat from time to time. AppSec knowledge can help DevOps engineers plan their deployments, contingency plans and communicate more effectively with the Security and Development team.\n\nIn this talk, we will introduce the principles of application security. We will first talk about the industry-standard OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities. We will then discuss the secure development lifecycle and how to implement security measures in each step. Finally, we will talk about how security teams can build an AppSec program in their organization to continuously improve their security posture.\n\nView the full LISA21 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa21/program"
