description: "PyData Tel Aviv Meetup #22\n3 April 2019\nSponsored and Hosted by SimilarWeb\nhttps://www.meetup.com/PyData-Tel-Aviv/\n\nServing tens of billions of personalized recommendations a day under a latency of 30 milliseconds is a challenge. In this talk I'll share our algorithmic architecture, including its Spark-based offline layer, and its Elasticsearch-based serving layer, that enable running complex models under difficult scale constraints and shorten the cycle between research and production.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nFind a PyData chapter near you: meetup.com/pro/pydata"
