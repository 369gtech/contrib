recordingDate: 1518514353
description: "Reflecting back on 2017, Service mesh has undoubtedly been one of the most exciting advances in infrastructure support for microservices and distributed systems architecture. However the introduction of service mesh into the architecture has raised questions around applicability of API gateway, which has led to many gateway vendors rethinking their product strategy and roadmap.\n\nBoth API gateway and service mesh address overlapping needs while neither alone provides all the API & service management capabilities; the capabilities that a modern distributed architecture must support for the autonomous teams to discover and consume APIs, which are built on a scalable, reliable and secure microservices foundation.\n\nIn this talk I am going to demystify the role of service mesh and API gateway in the architecture and the capabilities each provide.\n\nIf you are a technical lead or an architect on your journey towards a microservices architecture and need to make decisions around how to best utilise API gateway and service mesh, I will help you by walking you through a few reference architectures and insights into different products to get the most out of these technologies in a rapidly changing landscape."
