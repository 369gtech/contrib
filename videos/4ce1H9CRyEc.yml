title: 'Production-Ready Flink and Hive Integration - what story you can tell now? -  Bowen Li'
recordingDate: 1588246591
description: 'In this talk we will go thru the full Flink-Hive integration released in Flink 1.10. I will throw a few common use cases where Flink users demand capabilities of reading and writing Hive data, and referencing Hive UDFs. As illustration of how users can tackle these problems at ease, I will go thru Flink-Hive integration in details with examples. Attendees will be able to learn: - how to read and write Hive data (tables, views, partitions) natively in Flink - syntax and SQL commands that Flink supports - optimizations Flink added for Hive - how to reuse Hive UDFs in Flink'
