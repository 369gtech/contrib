description: "The Best Way To Learn To Code is to practice a lot on projects that you know or don't know how to do. Also, the best way to learn to code in 2020 or anytime is to convince someone who needs web development services to give you a chance and learn to code while you get paid.\nI've been learning all the time on the job that was required for longer than 20 years and a lot of my workmates have done the same!"
