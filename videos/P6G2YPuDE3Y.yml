description: "Recording brought to you by American Express. https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs\nWe, as two entry level engineers, took on the challenge of introducing Kotlin and Functional Programming to our company, Intuit. Even though you all know Kotlin is a great language, we overcame the obstacles associated with a large company structure of having a common tech stack. In addition, Kotlin provided a natural transition for OOP Java developers to use Functional Programming Paradigms. Hear about how, in less than two years, we went from getting our diplomas to gaining influence and driving change at a major technology company, and how you can do it too.\n\nResources:\nKotlinConf website: https://jb.gg/fyaze5\nKotlinConf on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlinconf\n\nKotlin website: https://jb.gg/pxrsn6\nKotlin blog: https://jb.gg/7uc7ow\nKotlin on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlin\n\n#KotlinConf19 #Kotlin #JetBrains #Java #FunctionalProgramming\n\nAbout the Presenters:\nShelby is a Senior Software Engineer working on back-end services in Kotlin and Java in the Developer Productivity Organization.
