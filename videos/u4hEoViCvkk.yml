Their solution makes it easy to view, manage, graph, categorize, analyze, and spot outliers in heaps of imaging data quickly and intuitively. In this session, we will discuss techniques the company uses to drill into thousands of images to find detailed patterns and insights using dynamic views, filtering, and graphing to find potential biases or erroneous entries for computer-vision based AI training.\n\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ruthieyakubu\nhttps://twitter.com/roger_noble\nhttps://twitter.com/getzegami\nhttps://twitter.com/TechExceptions\n\nðŸ’¡ Checkout our other channels for move on AI/ML tips & tricks:\nhttps://aka.ms/MSAIShow"
