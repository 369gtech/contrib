title: 'Strangling the Monolith With a Data-Driven Approach - David Julia, Simon Duffy'
language: English
recordingDate: 1513268856
description: "The scene: A complex procedure cost estimation system with hundreds of unknown business rules hidden in a monolithic application. A rewrite is started. If our system gives an incorrect result, the company is financially on the hook. A QA team demanding month-long feature freezes for testing. A looming deadline to cut over to the new system with severe financial penalties for missing the date. Tension is high. The business is nervous, and the team isn’t confident that it can replace the system without introducing costly bugs. Does that powder-keg of a project sound familiar?\n\nEnter Project X: At a pivotal moment in the project, the team changed their approach. They’d implement a unique, data-driven variation of the strangler pattern. They’d run their system in production alongside the legacy system, while collecting data on their system’s accuracy, falling back to the legacy system when answers differed. True to Lean Software development, they would amplify learning and use data to drive their product decisions.\n\nThe end result: An outstanding success. Happy stakeholders, business buy-in to release at will, a vastly reduced QA budget, reusable microservices, and one heck of a Concourse continuous delivery pipeline. We achieved all of this, while providing a system that was provably better than the legacy subsystem we replaced.\n\nThis talk will appeal to engineers, managers, and product managers.\n\nJoin us for a 30 minute session where we review this case study and learn how you too can:\n\nBuild statistically significant confidence in your system with data-driven testing\nStrangle the Monolith safely\nTake a Lean approach to legacy rewrites\nValidate your system’s accuracy when you don’t know the legacy business rules\nLeverage Continuous Delivery in a Legacy Environment\nGet Business and QA buy-in for Continuous Delivery\nArticulate the business value of data-driven product decisions\n\n\nSlides: TBA\n \nDavid Julia, Associate Director, Engineering (Pivotal Labs), Pivotal\nSimon Duffy, Product Manager, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2017"
