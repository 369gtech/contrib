title: 'Bruno Verachten - The Android Device Farm that fits in a (Cloudy) Pocket'
recordingDate: 1554637426
description: "Android developers are facing a common problem: how to test our applications on many devices without sacrificing too much time or money?\n\nHow to build and test automatically our applications for each commit?\nHow can we find those devices inside the company, whatever its size may be?\nCould there be a directory somewhere that lists those available devices?\nCould we use a device remotely and share it with other developers as if it were in the cloud?\n\nWhat if you could answer all these questions with the help of a low cost device farm that fits into a pocket? A pocket full of cloudsâ€¦\n\nOur proposal, aims to tackle this problem thanks to Docker, HypriotOS, Armbian, Gitlab CI and OpenSTF. It's an internal solution made of OSS readily available, but it has not yet been publicly announced as a whole."
