recordingDate: 1510306468
description: "The new generation of Spring Boot applications is here! With Spring Boot 2.0, developers can use the new Spring WebFlux reactive web framework.\n\nDuring this live coding session, Stéphane and Brian will create a WebFlux application and leverage Boot features such as Actuator, Developer Tools and more.\n\nSpring Boot 2.0 comes with many improvements and new features - Spring WebFlux allows reactive web endpoints and new HTTP runtimes such as Netty. This comes into two variants: a familiar annotation based approach similar to MVC and a new functional variant called \"WebFlux.fn\".\n\nWith 2.0, the Spring team leverages WebFlux with the \"convention over configuration\" flavor that made Boot so popular:\n\n* auto-configuration of your web application\n* customizing your app with configuration properties and callback-based interfaces\n* Actuators and Developer Tools support\n* leveraging the Spring ecosystem such as Spring Data and Spring Security\n\n# Stéphane Nicoll\nStéphane has a thing for code quality and robustness. He's been spreading the word for more than ten years while developing large scale Java enterprise applications in the geospatial, financial, or logistics sectors. An Apache Maven PMC member since 2006, he joined the core Spring Framework development team early 2014, being one of the main contributors to both Spring Framework and Spring Boot since. During his free time, he loves traveling around the world.\n\n#  Brian Clozel\nSpring Framework and Spring Boot team member, focusing on web-related stuff. Lead developer of Sagan, the Spring reference app that powers http://spring.io"
