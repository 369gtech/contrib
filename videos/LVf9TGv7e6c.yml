recordingDate: 1579160377
description: "Ruben Schade\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/177/\n\nThis talk focuses on three key areas OrionVM uses FreeBSD's unique features to build and secure cloud environments: as a general purpose guest OS, robust cloud storage with OpenZFS, VPC deployments with FreeNAS, PFSense for hybrid and virtual workloads, and scaling across multiple hypervisors with TidalScale.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n#linux.conf.au #linux #foss #opensource\n\nTue Jan 14 14:20:00 2020 at Room 9"
