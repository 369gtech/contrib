description: "Ask and vote for questions at: http://goo.gl/Uwsu4\n\nJoin us next week as we take a deeper dive into the new storage APIs available to Chrome Packaged Apps. We've invited Eric Bidelman, author of the HTML5 File System API book to join Paul Kinlan, Paul Lewis, Pete LePage and Renato Dias for our weekly Chrome Apps Office Hours in which we will pick apart some of the sample Chrome Apps and explain how we've used the storage APIs and why we made the decisions we did."
