description: "Let's imagine you are at the restaurant and ask for a vegetarian menu and communicate you are gluten-intolerant at the first contact with the staff. What happens next is that you are given all meals menu and the waiter recommends you a steak as today's special. On top, once you are done with your main course, you are recommended a regular cake. Wouldn't you feel your preferences and your characteristics as a customer are a bit ignored? :-)\n\nI will show you some examples of (large organizations') websites where I get exactly the same feeling, even though internet technology makes it way easier to recognize visitors' characteristics and interests, directly and indirectly.\n\nI will also share my experience with a business user type of approach to building seamless and more personalized in-site customer experience.\n\nThe speech took place on 9th of May on Marketing Stage during Infoshare 2019 in Gdansk, Poland.\n\n#marketing"
