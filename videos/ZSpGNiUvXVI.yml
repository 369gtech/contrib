The same system might simultaneously target desktops, browsers, cloud services and multiple different mobile devices. Each target with it's own requirements, tool-chains, APIs, SDKs and limitations. \nMixing platform specific code with core functionality often leads to spaghetti code resulting in a refactoring and maintenance nightmare that is non-portable, un-testable with ample nooks and crannies for bugs to hide in. \n\nIn this talk I'll present a system architecture that I call The Salami Method. The Salami Method finely distinguishes between the different aspects and layers required for exposing platform-independent C++ on different “specific” platforms. At its extreme it strives to create a single, thin, transparent layer for each such aspect so that each layer is more easily built, tested, debugged, managed and maintained. \n\nI will introduce the Salami Method and show a practical example of using it build a single C++ OpenCV app targeting both the desktop and the web with the same codebase. \n— \nAdi Shavit, Architect, Consultant\n\nAdi Shavit is an entrepreneur, speaker, independent consultant, experienced software architect and a computer vision, image processing, and machine learning expert with an emphasis on real-time applications.
