title: '"Macro Security for your Microservices" - Sreejith Anujan (LCA 2020)'
recordingDate: 1579219569
description: "Sreejith Anujan\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/21/\n\nBreaking down a monolithic application into atomic services offers various benefits, including better agility, better scalability and better ability to reuse services.  However, microservices also have particular security needs - \r\n\r\nTraffic encryption to defend against man-in-the-middle attack.\r\nFine grained access control and mutual TLS.\r\nAuditing tools to identity who did what at what time!\r\n\r\nIstio addresses the security challenges developers and operators face in a distributed microservice architecture. Istio provides strong identity, powerful policy, transparent TLS encryption, and authentication, authorization and audit (AAA) tools to protect your microservices and data. \r\n\r\nIn this hands on tutorial session, attendees will \r\n1) Understand the high level architecture of Istio \r\n2) Custom policy enforcement to  limit traffic to a service\r\n3) Service Traffic encryption using Mutual TLS\r\n\r\nTakeaway: Learn how  Istio enforces security features to mitigate insider and external threats against  your data, endpoints, communication and platform , wherever you run your microservices.\r\n\r\nPre-requisites: \r\nIntermediate understanding of container technology and microservices architecture. BYOD with a modern browser and an internet connection to access cloud based labs.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
