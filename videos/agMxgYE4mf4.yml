title: '"Learning from machines" by Ashi Krishnan'
language: English
recordingDate: 1539371496
description: "Why can't you tickle yourself? How do you know where you are? Why do DeepDream images look so trippy? Why are experts in a field sometimes unable to accept new advances? Why does trauma come in waves, washing over us again and again? Computational neuroscience provides insight into these questions and more. In this talk, we'll look at models of cognition informed by machine learning and computation, and investigate how these models can help us examine and reconfigure our own processes of being.\n\nSpeaker: Ashi Krishnan"
