title: '"Server platforms: experiment with your expensive hardware too!" - Jeremy Kerr (LCA 2021 Online)'
recordingDate: 1612093542
description: "Jeremy Kerr\n\nhttps://lca2021.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/73/\n\nWe love to disassemble, rework, reconfigure and improve our consumer devices,\r\nbut tend to leave the more \"serious\" server platforms alone, with their warranties\r\nintact. Most servers include at least one embedded Linux system for platform\r\ncontrol, which we can modify to suit almost any purpose. This talk brings the\r\nconcept of hackable hardware into the server space.\r\n\r\nRecent server platforms have a huge scope for customisation, and most are built\r\non an open source core. With just a little background on conventional server\r\nhardware designs, and the customisable components they're built from, we have\r\nthe exciting opportunity to adapt most server platforms to our own purpose -\r\nwhether it be tweaking the management interfaces to better suit a deployment\r\nenvironment, implementing custom functionality for specific workload models, or\r\nfull-scale replacement of platform firmware.\r\n\r\nThis technical talk covers a background on common server design conventions,\r\nplus the specific hardware, software, firmware and tooling that you'll likely\r\nencounter in this space. This will provide a background for experimenting with\r\nyour own devices, and take warranty-voiding to a whole new (enterprise!) level.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
