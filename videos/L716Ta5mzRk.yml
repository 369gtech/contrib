title: 'Model Based SW Engineering: a success story from development of the Joint Strike Missile'
recordingDate: 1568716998
description: "Trygve RÃ¸ste & Tormod Ambli\n\nMissile systems are complex embedded systems with demanding requirements related to both product and process. With development timeframes of 5 to 10 years and product maintenance for more than 30 years, the effort to keep information correct and updated is immense and painstaking. In an effort to overcome some of these challenges, the Missiles division at Kongsberg has during the last 10 years gone from document based to model based engineering.\n\nFrom a SW engineering perspective the model based approach has given us benefits way beyond documentation.\nThe model together with an in house component based infrastructure and code generator, gives us the ability to design and reuse SW architectures at a high abstraction level in the model and generate all necessary code to bind the functional SW components (hand written code) into working SW products.\n\nThis presentation gives a tour on how we do model based SW engineering from requirements to code, and present our experiences along the way. We will walk through a reference model showing how system requirements are processed into system design and software architecture and how the software architecture model is kept in a consistent state through code generation of IDL interfaces and CCM architecture configuration files. We will also show how large parts of the model and code, through careful use abstractions and modularization, are reused in test and simulation products.\n\n\nSave the date for NDC TechTown 2020  (31st of August - 3rd of September)\n\nCheck out more of our talks at: \nhttps://ndctechtown.com/\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/"
