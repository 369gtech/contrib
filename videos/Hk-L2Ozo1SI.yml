title: 'Plugging into the Java Compiler'

description: "The Java compiler enables plug-ins (annotation processors) to analyze source code and generate source code to be compiled in the same compilation job. This powerful technique is underused! This session demonstrates it at work in several open source projects—such as Dagger (by Square and Google), a dependency-injection system similar to Guice, and AutoValue (by Google), which simplifies the creation of immutable classes—as well as how JavaFX uses annotation processors to generate GUI builders. The presentation also shows how to write simple code-generating and code-validating annotation processors, showcasing infrastructure for making them easy, clear, and correct.\n\n\nAuthors:\nChristian Gruber\nJava developer, member of Google's Java Core Libraries team, co-author of Dagger 1 and Dagger 2, Truth testing library author, and various other open-source libraries.\n\nBlog: http://www.geekinasuit.com\nView more trainings by Christian Gruber at https://www.parleys.com/author/christian-gruber\n\n Éamonn McManus\nÉamonn McManus is a member of Google's App Engine SDK team, and is a 20% time contributor to the Java Core Libraries team, the authors of Google Guava.
