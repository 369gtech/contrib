title: 'Event Sourcing architecture with Azure Cosmos DB & Azure Functions'
language: English
recordingDate: 1632920404
description: "These days some of the best solutions are Serverless - code executing in the cloud, reading and writing data to datastores in the cloud, without having to worry about trivial details like the data schema and scaling issues. This talk goes beyond the Serverless hype and discusses practical implementation of event sourcing using Azure Functions & CosmosDB - in particular, the change feed feature of Cosmos DB. We will walk through an event sourcing architecture and how to implement the datastore, events and materialized view in a serverless fashion.\n\nDocs Pages/CTAs:\nAzure Functions: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview?WT.mc_id=azureserverless-34584-jemorg\nCosmos DB: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/?WT.mc_id=azureserverless-34584-jemorg\nAzure SQL DB: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/?WT.mc_id=azureserverless-34584-jemorg\nLogic Apps: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps//?WT.mc_id=azureserverless-34584-jemorg\nLearn Collection: https://aka.ms/azureserverlessconf/resources \n \nCloud Skills Challenge: https://aka.ms/azureserverlessconf/challenge"
