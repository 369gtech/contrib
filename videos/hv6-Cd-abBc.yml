description: "Recently, many efforts have been made in order to gain a better understanding of model predictions and the reliance of their input features. Although we still don’t have a satisfying theory for neural networks nor do we know for sure what is hiding in a sentence or a document vector, there are several methods that can be used to gain insights regarding the relation between the model’s input and its output. In this talk, we will review some of these methods, as well as the latest attempts of understanding RNN in NLP. In addition, we will present several novel ideas for incorporating a visualisation of these methods in a product, as a way to enhance the user experience and user retention.\n\nVisit the largest developer playground in Europe!\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/wearedevelopers\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/WeAreDevs\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/_wearedevelopers/\n\n#WeAreDevs"
