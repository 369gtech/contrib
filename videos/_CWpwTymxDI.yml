title: 'So many Docker platforms, so little time... - Michele Bustamante'
recordingDate: 1492584289
description: "Docker is a key player in the microservices movement and is arguably the leader in containerization technology. That said, there are many ways to \"do Docker\".\nBetween the leading cloud providers (AWS, Azure, Google) and other leading platform stacks (Docker/Swarm, Apache Mesos - DC/OS, Docker Data Center) and it can get confusing. In this session, Michele will bring her customer experiences building solutions across most of these platforms - to provide you with the highlights, the architecture topologies, and some perspective on the way she helps her customers choose the right platform for their cloud, on premise or hybrid solutions."
