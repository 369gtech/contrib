title: 'CON7101   Taming Microservices Testing with Docker and Arquillian Cube'
language: English
recordingDate: 1449894037
description: "The Borg is docking your system; testing is futile! Or is it? With microservices, polyglot, and DevOps on the rise, where are we at with testing? Do these technologies bring more complexity and make our testing effort harder, or maybe the contrary? Do they actually help us write better tests more easily? This session explores not only how we can do our testing in this new world but also how the new world can help us test better. It takes a close look at various topics, from NodeJS-, DynJS-, VertX-, Ceylon-, or Ruby-orchestrated microservices through system-scale testing with various configurations to database migration and regression testing. All are within reach.\n\nSpeakers:\nAslak Knutsen, Senior Software Engineer, Red Hat Inc\nArquillian lead and cofounder Aslak Knutsen is a Senior Software Engineer at Red Hat where he is working on projects such as Arquillian and ShrinkWrap, one of the founders of the JBoss Testing initiative and a speaker at major industry conferences including JavaOne, Devoxx, Geecon, DevNation, IBM Impact and Oracle Open World. Java Champion and JavaOne Rockstar.\n\nBartosz Majsak, Software Engineer, Cambridge Technology Partners\nBartosz Majsak works as a software developer at Cambridge Technology Partners, based in Zurich. Passionate about open source technologies and testing methodologies, Bartosz is a proud JBoss Community Recognition award recipient for both 2012 and 2013. He's also an Arquillian team member and the lead for two modules: Persistence Extension (makes writing database-oriented tests easier) and Spock Test Runner (gives your Arquillian tests some BDD and Groovy love). One thing that perhaps proves he is not a total geek is his addiction to alpine skiing."
