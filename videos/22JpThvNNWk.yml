title: 'YOW! Perth 2018 - Katie Bell - Containers in Production'
recordingDate: 1538620641
description: "Docker containers are appearing everywhere. They give you a reproducible and isolated environment for your code to run in. Great, so how do I take my container and run it in production? I need load balancing, service discovery, autoscaling, logging etc. and they don't magically appear in container land.\nAll the big cloud providers offer hosted ways for you to run Docker containers in production. This is great because most of us don't have a large ops team to set that up. Unfortunately these systems still require a fair amount of setup and configuration to run a production ready service. With a particular focus on the AWS and cross-platform tools available, I'll show you how to launch a containerised service on each of them and go through why you might pick one over another.\n\nKatie is a Lead Engineer at Campaign Monitor, where she's working on a bunch of different things focusing around how developer's code reaches production. Before that she was a full-stack developer at Grok Learning, bringing the joys of programming to masses of high school kids, and before that she spent six years working at Google, first a software engineer then as a site reliability engineer. She's had a lot of experience writing and deploying code, most of which has been running in containers.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
