title: 'JIT Learning: It''s great until it isn''t'
recordingDate: 1548211949
description: "Tessa Bradbury\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/224/\n\nJust-in-time learning, the act of learning when you need it rather than spending weeks/months/years on it up front, is part and parcel of modern software development. It's how we make it though the ever-changing industry we're in and how we make use of all the abstraction layers we have. But does it really work for everything?\r\n\r\nDrawing on specific stories from my first few years as a software developer, we'll explore some of the underlying assumptions of JIT learning, some notable instances where it falls apart and some ways of addressing those issues.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/\n\n#linux.conf.au #linux #foss #opensource"
