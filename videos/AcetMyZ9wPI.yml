description: "Yes, the one from the 80's. Yes, I'm a little mad.\nQ Misell\n\nSunday 16th, 12:30 (Ferrier Hall)\nA talk (25 minutes)\nFollowing on from my talk last year on making a C compiler for the BBC Micro, I will be using said compiler to write and run a python interpreter that can run on the BBC Micro. Come to learn about how compilers work in general, how python is technically a compiled and interpreted language, the struggles I had fitting as much as possible of python into 64K of RAM and ROM, and some interesting things I learnt about python along the way. If you already know a lot about compilers then this may be the talk for you, as it's not every day you have to fit a compiler into such limited RAM, and such a limited instruction set."
