title: 'The many shapes of Polymorphism by Luca Molteni'
language: English
recordingDate: 1488459076
description: "The influence of the types of polymorphism on the design and usage of a programming language is significant. It is important to explore it in order to understand how type systems influence the shape of our code and the quality of our programs through real life examples using Java and Scala. We'll see how our programs evolve by adding new features and behaviours with different shapes and we'll compare the results. We'll also try to see how different language features such as pattern matching and classes coexist.\n\nLuca Molteni is a Software Engineer in love with Functional Programming since 2007. He's very active in the Milan software developers communities, helping managing the Haskell ITA group and the Java User Group since 2010"
