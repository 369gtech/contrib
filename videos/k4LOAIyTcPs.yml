description: "SREcon16 Europe - Bridging Multicast to the Cloud\n\nDaniel Emord, Pythian\n\nAs more organizations move their workloads to cloud providers, they may discover small gotchas that prevent them from easily running their existing applications that are currently in traditional on-premises environments. One such example is multicast: none of the big players support multicast traffic between nodes in their cloud offerings. The solution? Overlay a mesh virtual network that supports multicast between nodes and can be extended to include on-premises systems. In this talk, weâ€™ll go over how to bring multicast into your cloud environment by implementing n2n in a resilient fashion to link on-premises and cloud environments through a gateway.\n\nView the full SREcon16 Europe Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon16europe/program"
