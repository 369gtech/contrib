description: "As a formalized language, CSS is over 20 years old and has spent much of that time being maligned by the people who use it. Browser inconsistencies, changing specifications and general weirdness have combined to create this weird pseudo-language that you'd rather avoid.\n\nUNTIL TODAY. With modern specs and tooling, CSS has never been more straightforward and less reliant on hacks. In this talk, Lemon will show you some common traps people fall in, as well as some general strategies for making a layout grid you can proud to build and confident in releasing."
