description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM SF 19 http://bit.ly/2T3Do0U\n\nGet involved in Code Sync's next conference http://bit.ly/2Mcm4aS\n\n---\n\nUNDERSTANDING ERLANG KERNEL\nby Boshan Sun\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nErlang\nKernel\nBEAM\n\nTALK LEVEL: Intermediate\n\nABSTRACT\nThe Kernel application has all the code necessary to run the Erlang runtime system. Every application needs to include a kernel application to be able to run. When starting an Erlang shell there are 39 processes running inside BEAM.\n\nWhat are those 39 processes and how do they work together to make BEAM tick?\n\nWhat exactly does Erlang kernel do and why does every application need it?\n\nWhat happened inside BEAM when you print a simple hello world to the screen?\n\nIn this talk, we will take a deep dive into Erlang's kernel and find out how beautiful Erlang's internal works.\n\nRead the full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/boshan-sun/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - BOSHAN SUN\nLearned Erlang from Joe Armstrong himself; also spawn_monitored one child so far :)\n\nBoshan enjoyed functional programming when he first encountered Elixir/Erlang. He's been BEAMing ever since!\n\nMore on Boshan Sun: https://codesync.global/speaker/boshan-sun/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM SF 19\nCode BEAM SF is powered by Code Sync.
