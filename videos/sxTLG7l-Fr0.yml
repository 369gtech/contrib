description: "NumFOCUS Code of Conduct\n\nBe kind to others. Do not insult or put down others. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for NumFOCUS.\n\nAll communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate.\n\nNumFOCUS is dedicated to providing a harassment-free community for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, and expression, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of community members in any form.\n\nThank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for all.\n\nIf you haven't yet, please read the detailed version here:\nhttps://numfocus.org/code-of-conduct\n\n------\n\nAlon Nir: Getting an Edge with Network Analysis with Python\n\nNetworks are all around us. People, places, things and even ideas are inter-connected in innumerable networks, and these can have a great (yet sometimes inconspicuous) impact on our lives.\nThe purpose of this talk is to provide an introduction to network analysis and its importance, and present the basic building blocks for applied network analysis with Python (using the friendly NetworkX library). I hope this talk will encourage members of the audience to consider network analysis approaches in their line of work/research and intrigue them to learn more.\nThe talk will weave theory and practice, and given the limited time compared to the breadth of the topic, the focus would lean towards intuitive understanding of concepts and seeing them in practice, over deep theoretical formulations and hardcore mathematics.\n\nAlon's Bio: I'm a London based senior data scientist. Currently I am a data science lead at Deliveroo, working on Plus, the company's premium subscription service. Come geek out on data with me at https://www.linkedin.com/in/alonnir/ or twitter.com/alonnir\n-------\n\nAlan Akbik: The Flair Framework for Text Analytics and NLP Research\n\nAbstract: This talk gives an overview of the Flair Framework for Natural Language Processing (NLP). It's two main features are that (1) it is very easy to use and (2) that it gets state-of-the-art accuracies on many NLP tasks. I'll give an introduction from the practitioner's side and show how Flair can be used for tasks such as Named Entity Recognition or Sentiment Analysis on your data, and show how you can train your own models. I'll also briefly cover research aspects of the framework, such as learning word and sentence representations with neural language modeling, and discuss future directions.\n\nAlan's Bio: Alan recently joined the Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin as professor of machine learning. His group focuses on natural language processing (NLP), i.e. methods that enable machines to understand human language. His research is made available in form of the open source NLP framework Flair that allows anyone to use state-of-the-art NLP methods in their research or applications. Before that, he spent many years in industrial research labs, first at IBM Research in California, then at Zalando Research in Berlin. He completed his PhD in 2015 at the TU Berlin, vowing to never return to academia again.\n\nGo ahead and check out https://github.com/flairNLP/flair"
