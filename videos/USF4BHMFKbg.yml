description: 'Sometimes, you just need your Perl to go one higher. This talk will teach you how to use functions that return functions for powerful, succinct solutions to some repetitive coding problems. Along the way, you’ll see concrete examples using higher-order Perl to generate declarative, structured “fake” data for testing.'
