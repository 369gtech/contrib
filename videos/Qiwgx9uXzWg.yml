description: "Google I/O 2010 - Making smart & scalable Wave robots \r\n\r\nWave 201 \r\n\r\nDavid Byttow, Marcel Prasetya \r\n\r\nA smart robot must be able to store persistent data. Wave robots can store data in wave structures, like wavelets, datadocs, and annotations, instead of traditional datastores. A scalable robot must perform operations with minimal bandwidth. Wave robots can optimize by selecting the appropriate amount of context, the optimal events, and narrow filters for events. In this talk, we'll share best practices on data storage and scaling.  \r\n\r\nFor all I/O 2010 sessions, please go to http://code.google.com/events/io/2010/sessions.html"
