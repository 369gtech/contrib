title: 'Bart Szulc - Chaos Engineering Bottom Up'
language: English
recordingDate: 1620221655
description: "Chaos is the most dangerous thing in this world. It is all around us all the time. Without control, chaos will kill you. You may recognise this quote from Witcher. Unfortunately in my presentation I won't discuss how to recognise demons and what sword works best on dragons. Instead I'm going to discuss chaos engineering.\n\nWhile it might be a surprise, Witcher's chaos definition has a lot in common with software development. Chaos is definitely something we shall understand, appreciate and... play with. Wait did you just say play? Like play with fire? It doesn't sound like a good idea. While counter intuitive, playing with chaos is the only thing that's gonna help your team improve and move forward. \n\nNoticed \"team\" in the last statement? Instead of looking at chaos engineering from individual perspective, I'm gonna look at it as team practice. Discuss available plays. Share lessons from our try outs and how we've been continuously improving our plays to optimise for different objectives.\n\nKey takeaways:\n- Learn plays like War Games, Chaos Bash, Fire Drill, and you and  your team can implement them once you back from the conference\n- Learn how to incorporate chaos engineering as a practice into your sprints and roadmap work\n- Learn how to transition from quality assurance to reliability champion with chaos engineering\n- Appreciate human aspect of chaos engineering and what you can do as a team to make on-calls safe."
