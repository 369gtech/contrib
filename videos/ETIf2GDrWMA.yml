description: "If you are here, then you’ve likely made it past the breakwaters of your career. Those early years can be profoundly exhilarating.

You face vast stretches of career that can be met with little more than what you already have.\n\nAnd therein lies the threat. The valuable skills that you lack are at the vital margins of your career, but your comfort zone is large enough now that you are no longer pressed toward those margins.\n\nAnd so, Katrina Owen argues, you must design your own crucible.\n\nSubscribe to O'Reilly on YouTube: http://goo.gl/n3QSYi\n\nFollow O'Reilly on: \nTwitter: http://twitter.com/oreillymedia\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/OReilly\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/oreillymedia\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/8459/"
