description: "Lets discover how DevOps should help your product: why it is good to have all your infrastructure in code, to be able to track all the changes, how immutable deploys make your life easier because all the environments are reproducible and they donâ€™t rely on any existing state and how to pick up relevant alerts and monitoring. \n\nOn the demo side you will be able to discover 2 very powerful tools to help you automate your cloud infrastructure: Terraform and Ansible. Terraform does a great job at infrastructure provisioning the artifacts that are more statical: like VPCs, security groups, load balancers, DNS entries, queues. With it you can easily codify your infrastructure and keep it in source control. While Ansible makes the connection between all the existing cloud infrastructure and provisioning of your virtual machines: starting them, finding them dynamically, installing your apps, monitoring of the vm and apps, releasing the vms, all the stuff needed for immutable deploys."
