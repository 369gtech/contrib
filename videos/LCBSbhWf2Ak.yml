recordingDate: 1542844391
description: 'At Adjust, we produce near-real-time analytics on over 400TB of high velocity data. This talk is a brief introduction to how we do it, and it serves as a showcase for what PostgreSQL is capable of doing in a big data environment. This talk will be of interest to people looking for information about how open source databases can be used at massive scales, approaches to federated data, and general open source success case studies. - Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/channel/JUMjvCF2ucj'
