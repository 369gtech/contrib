description: "Code Here: http://goo.gl/SvpXv\n\nBest Java Book : http://goo.gl/FtKp0m\n\nIn this part of the Java Video Tutorial I cover Java Linked Lists. The LinkedList class is a collection based on a linked list instead of an array like the ArrayList. They are good when you plan to add and delete items. They aren't particularly efficient at providing access based off of index searches though."
