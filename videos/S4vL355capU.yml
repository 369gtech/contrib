description: "Join us for #RenderConf 2018: https://goo.gl/iXs1mJ\n\nSlides: http://bit.ly/render2017slides\n\nDeep neural networks are the latest hot computing trend – but to most people they are still a bit of a mystery.\n\nWith the release of libraries like Google’s Tensorflow and the open source ConvNetJS, there’s never been a better time to start learning about deep learning.\n\nWe’ll start right at the beginning – no prior knowledge needed – but by the end of the talk I aim for you to go away as excited about neural nets as I am, and knowledgeable enough to rave to your friends about them in the pub.\n\nWe’ll focus on CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) as they can do super fun things with images. We’ll see how they can produce weird and wonderful works of art, how they can turn your selfies into masterpieces, and perhaps look at some of the occasionally hilarious results of when they go wrong.\n\nABOUT ROSIE CAMPBELL\n\nRosie's background is Physics and Computer Science and she now works as a Technologist at BBC R&D. Her latest technology passions are image processing and deep neural networks, and she is lucky enough to be combining them for her doctoral research."
