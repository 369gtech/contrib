title: '"Privacy Preserving IoT" - Christopher J Biggs (LCA 2020)'
recordingDate: 1579221205
description: "Christopher J Biggs\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/75/\n\nRight now, the state of privacy on the Internet is \"we collect every bit of data about you, crosslink everything\r\nand use it to manipulate your attention\".     The internet of Things brings the promise (threat?) that \"every bit\" comes to mean\r\nnot just everything you did online, but also everything you did in your home, workplace, car and bedroom.\r\n\r\nThe future is shaped by those who have the strongest vision of what it should be.   Right now that's Big Data, which \r\nculturally rhymes with \"Big Oil\", \"Big Tobacco\" and \"Big Pharma\".   If we don't want the grim meathook future they are cooking up for us, we need to visualise what we DO want  and fight harder to make it happen.\r\n\r\nSo what does a privacy-perserving future look like?    How can we construct an internet where the value of information accrues to individuals, not to billionaires?\r\n\r\nMany of the pieces are already in place.\r\n\r\n  * Emerging data processing algorithms such as Private Set Intersection and Homomorphic Encryption\r\n  * Personal data enclaves such as the Hub of All Things (HAT) (hubofallthings.com)\r\n  * Data exchanges like the Sam project (samnow.com)\r\n  * Privacy-first IoT data networks like LoRaWAN and Amazon IoT\r\n\r\nJoin us as we fit these pieces together  and imagine what Internet life (aka \"life\") might look like when we wrest power back from Big Data.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
