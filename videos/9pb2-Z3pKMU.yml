description: "Brian Aker, inventor of Drizzle, talks about the attractions of\r\nGearman, the adaptation of database technology to large multi-core and\r\nmulti-node environments, and what relational databases are and are not\r\ngreat for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBrian has spent his life working on the details of how to build and scale out systems. He is currently working on a new MicroKernel designed MySQL called Drizzle and is building the plumbing required for a new generation of large scale computer deployment. He also spends time working on Apache Modules, Memcached, and Gearman.\r\n\r\nIn the past, he has been involved with projects for the Army Engineer Corps, The VirtualHospital, Splunk, MySQL, Slashdot, and was a Distinguished Engineer at Sun Microsystems. He calls Seattle his home since that is where his dog Rosalynd is."
