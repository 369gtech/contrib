description: "Alan Turing set out to find the answer to the question: \"Can machines think?\". Part of his question targeted creativity and the idea could machines write poetry?\n\nCan machines be creative is the question of this talk.\n\nCreativity exists in the world of romance, a hard target for machines. Machines being creative forces us to ask hard questions about their place as artists and where their art stands in our world.\n\nCould you distinguish between a machine's creative attempts and a humans? We will start our journey down the path of discovering a new generation of AI artists born through code. We will look into their hearts and brains examining different algorithms/techniques and there effectiveness at exhibiting creativeness.\n\nCan machines be creative?\n\nJoseph Wilk\nSoundCloud\n@josephwilk\n\n\nDeveloper at SoundCloud helping shape the future of music on the Internet.\n\n\nRecorded at Strange Loop conference (https://thestrangeloop.com) in St. Louis, MO, Oct 2013."
