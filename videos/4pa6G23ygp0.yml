Where do I find the time to keep my technical skills relevant? How do I learn more about the business so I can understand the needs of the organisation better?\n\nIf you are attending this conference you already understand the importance of investing in your development. But what should you do the rest of the year? In this talk we will explore ways to plan and find the focus you need to better support your team and prepare for your next career challenge. We will discuss techniques I have found useful over the years to prioritise my goals and manage the overwhelming amounts of content we are exposed to every day in this ever-changing industry and come up with a plan that fits your ambitions and availability constraints.\n\nAbout Maria Gutierrez\n\nMaria Gutierrez is VP of Engineering at FreeAgent, one of the UK’s largest and most popular, online accounting software providers."
