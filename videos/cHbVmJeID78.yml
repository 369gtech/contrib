When it takes a lot of time to backup or restore a database, Garbage Collection might break the snapshot used in the backup or restore process. Thus, some changes might be missing. This threatens data safety. TiKV is a distributed Key-Value database that features geo-replication, horizontal scalability, consistent and distributed transactions, and coprocessor support. In this talk, Jay Lee will show how backup and restore work in TiKV, and what has been done to make backup and restore fast and safe. \n\nhttps://sched.co/cpAn"
