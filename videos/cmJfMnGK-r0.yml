title: 'microXchg 2017 - Lotte Johansen: Challenges Testing Microservices in Distributed Systems'
language: English
recordingDate: 1487316853
description: 'Finn.no, Norway''s number one online market place, used to be a monolith but has migrated to Microservices during the last 4 years. The daily life of developers has become a lot better with Microservices, instead of everyone working on the same monolith. However, a problem arises when testing services thoroughly, as each service is dependent on other Microservices. This has been a big challenge, and has led to a lot of manual testing. However, lately we have started using a tool called WireMock which helps us stubbing out other Microservices. We will explain how this tool has helped us. Hopefully, the talk will help other developers with similar problems to get better testing when using Microservices.'
