HOW TO HANDLE CHANGE\nby Anna Sherman\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nPain-relieving Functional Flexibility\n\nABSTRACT\nChange is a natural part of the development process, however, many of us experience pain when we need to pivot. Whether at an organization level or within a development feature, change can feel overwhelming. We will discuss how to make change less painful through functional programming. We will also uncover foundational tools to help developers deal with change and maximize their growth through the process. This talk has benefits for both seasoned and new functional developers.\n\nSlides & full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/anna-sherman/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - ANNA SHERMAN\nAnna is the lead organizer for include(Chatt), a developer meetup in Chattanooga that celebrates diversity in the software community.\n\nAnna Sherman is a functional developer and team lead at Zillion, an insurtech startup that makes it easy to protect the things you love.
