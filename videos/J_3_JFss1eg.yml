description: "Bing’s architecture is continuously evolving to reduce costs, reduce time to market, and increase availability. The latest change has embraced Microservices architecture using the commercially available product line: VisualStudio.com, Service Fabric, and ASP.NET Core all running on Azure virtual machines.\n\nIn this talk Louis will cover how these tools, combined with a heavy dose of automated testing and production monitoring, will yield DevOps workflows with both “Commit-To-Production” continuous deployment as well as 99.95% high availability."
