description: "This video was recorded at ElixirConf EU Virtual 2020 - https://www.elixirconf.eu/archives/vi...\n\nMore great virtual tech conferences - https://codesync.global \n\n---\n\nScenic Now and Looking Ahead\nby\nBoyd Multerer\n\nABSTRACT\nScenic is a deep UI platorm built in Elixir and intended for machines and situations where a webserver is not appropriate. This is often IoT devices, but covers other situations as well. In the past year, Boyd has worked on a LOT of code, which is related to, but not directly in Scenic. In this talk he will discuss the current state of Scenic, where it is going and why and explain what to expect in the future.\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - Boyd Multerer\n\nBoydâ€™s near 30-year career spans the range of software projects, from desktop publishing, to web servers, to game consoles, to low-level operating systems. For the past four years, he has been independently exploring and building a full stack for Connected Devices that heavily leverages the BEAM.\n\nPreviously, Boyd spent 18 years at Microsoft running engineering for things such as Xbox Live, XNA (game developer program), and everything OS for Xbox One. This work includes large scaled-out datacenter services, VMs, and the layout of the hypervisor/kernel.\n\nHis most recent release is the open-source Scenic libraries, which is a functional UI stack built on the BEAM. Its primary goal is for use in connected devices, but it is already being used for desktop apps and more. His current work takes the foundation laid with Scenic and is attempting to answer deeper questions about the future of client-side operating systems.\n\n---\n\nElixirConf EU\nWebsite: https://www.elixirconf.eu/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ElixirConfEU"
