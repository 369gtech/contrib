title: 'CON2954 - Is Your Profiler Speaking the Same Language as You?'
language: English
recordingDate: 1450129485
description: "Profilers are absolute beasts. They might prove useful for pinpointing the performance issues in your Java applications, and with profilers, developers have the good fortune to be able to find the root cause of an issue at hand. However, it requires effort to actually comprehend the data collected by a profiler. Due to the inherent complexity of the data, you have to understand how it is collected—and thus understand how the profiler actually works. This presentation goes through the classic profiler features and answers questions such as What is a hotspot? What is the difference between sampling and instrumentation from the profiler’s point of view? What are the problems with either of those methods? What is the time budget of the application? And more.\n\nSpeaker:\nSimon Maple, Developer Advocate, ZeroTurnaround\nSimon is a Developer Advocate at ZeroTurnaround, a Java Champion since 2014, JavaOne Rockstar speaker in 2014, Virtual JUG founder and organiser, London Java Community co-leader and RebelLabs author.
