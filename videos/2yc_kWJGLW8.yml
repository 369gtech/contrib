description: "Building a Performance Analytics Tool with ActiveSupport by Christian Bruckmayer\n\n\"Setting up a performance analytics tool like NewRelic or Skylight is one of the first things many developers do in a new project. However, have you ever wondered how these tools work under the hood?\n\nIn this talk, we will build a basic performance analytics tool from scratch. We will deep dive into ActiveSupport instrumentations to collect, group and normalise metrics from your app. To persist these metrics, we will use a time series database and visualise the data on a dashboard. By the end of the talk, you will know how your favourite performance analytics tool works.\"\n\n__________\n\n\"Christian Bruckmayer originally from Nuremberg, Germany, but now calls Bristol, UK, his home. In his day job, he makes everyday cooking fun at Cookpad, the best place to find and share home cooked recipes. Since 2014 he is an avid open source contributor hacking for instance on JRuby, openSUSE Linux or various gems.\n\nIf he's not hacking Ruby, he's out doing what 'young' people do: traveling the world, skiing in the alps or going to concerts of his favourite band.\""
