description: "Google Tech Talks\nMarch, 14 2008\n\nABSTRACT\n\nAdult self-identity forms with great personal sacrifice in the face of chronic violence routinely experienced in childhood via adult socialization practices. Through these practices children internalize the \"power structures that shape our lives\" which later stand between the individual and his or her own enlightened self-awareness.\n\nJoseph Zornado wanted to elaborate on what his talk Our Future is Our History (at noon) will be about. I've posted his letter at: http://www.corp.google.com/~klea/zornado-letter.html\n\nSpeaker: J. Zornado\nJ. Zornado teaches English at Rhode Island College in Providence, RI. He wrote two books about child-rearing and violence."
