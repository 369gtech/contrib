description: "In this video we're going to build the popular game Pong from scratch in Python, then train a neural network to become an unbeatable 2nd player! We use Tensorflow to build our neural net and pygame to build our Pong game. \n\nThe full, working code for this video is here:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/pong_neural_network_live\n\nUnlike my previous 2 live sessions where i did less than 60 lines of code each, I tried to do about 400 lines of code in this one. So I didn't have time to get to everything! \n\nI created a Slack channel for us, sign up here:\nhttps://wizards.herokuapp.com/\n\nPlease share this video, like, comment and subscribe!  And please support me on Patreon!:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/user?u=3191693\n\nThat's what keeps me going. I love you all.\nFollow me:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/sirajraval\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/sirajology Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/sirajraval/ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/sirajraval/"
