description: "Easy interactive data applications with Dash\n[EuroPython 2018 - Talk - 2018-07-27 - PyCharm [PyData]]\n[Edinburgh, UK]\n\nBy Matteo Guzzo\n\nPlotly Dash is a Python  framework for building interactive dashboards and web data applications, based on Flask, React.js, and Plotly. It allows a python-only approach to something that previously required knowledge of Javascript, heavily reducing the overhead required to create a web application. I'll show how easy it is to set up a small interactive web app using data from the Twitch API and to expand it at will, using only Python.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2018.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
