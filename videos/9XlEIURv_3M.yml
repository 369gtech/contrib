The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nOverview and State of Linkerd - William Morgan & Tarun Pothulapati, Buoyant, Inc. \n\nIn this talk, maintainers from the Linkerd project will present an overview of the project and an update on upcoming releases. They'll cover what Linkerd is and how it compares to other service meshes; what the latest features and functionality are; what to expect in upcoming releases; and how you can get involved in one of the CNCF's most talked-about projects. This talk will include Linkerd's new seamless multi-cluster and TCP mutual TLS (mtls) features in the 2.8 and 2.9 releases, as well as performance benchmarks and recent changes in Linkerd's underlying micro-proxy, Linkerd2-proxy. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ekIN"
