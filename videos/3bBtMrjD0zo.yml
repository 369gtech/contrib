description: "In-Memory data grids have historically been the exclusive domain of large investment banks and proprietary solutions such as Oracle Coherence, Pivotal Gemfire and Software AG Terracotta. Hazelcast provides aopensource solution that is easy to develop, elastic in scaling and fault tolerant. Implemented in Java it offers some key advantages compared to other opensource players in arena. You can't send logic execution to Memcached node and Redis LUA interpreter is no match for state of art JVM. Also, it fits easily in Java micro-services architectures.\n\nFirst part of presentation will cover simple use case, fictional stock brokerage system, that shows basic distributed structures and their behavior.\nSecond part will show some advanced features of Hazelcast like event listeners and data affinity.\nAt the end comparison between Hazelcast, on one side, and redis and memcached, on the other is going to be presented."
