title: 'Google I/O 2013 - Building an Online Education Platform using Google Technologies'
recordingDate: 1368895288
description: "Peter Norvig \n\nLast summer, 155K Google users came together in a virtual classroom by signing up for our experimental \"\"Power Searching with Google\"\" MOOC (massive open online course).  Twenty-thousand of those students âgraduated.â Two months later, we launched an open source project called Course Builder--based on the original Power Searching MOOC code--to make the technology powering the class available to everyone. This session is a case study of how Course Builder evolved from Power Searching with Google MOOC to an online course delivery platform. We'll focus on how Google's APIs and technologies facilitated the development of the initial system and continue to support the open source platform. \n\nFor all I/O 2013 sessions, go to https://developers.google.com/live"
