title: '🚀 DevTernity 2016: Seth Vargo - Practical Organizational Security with Vault'
language: English
recordingDate: 1482426395
description: "❗️ATTENTION ❗️\nRegistration to 🚀DevTernity 2018 is running:\n✅ https://devternity.com\n\nVault is a free and open source tool that took the security industry by surprise in 2015. Due to its innovative architecture, Vault is highly scalable and operationally secure. In addition to behaving like an encrypted key-value store (like encrypted Redis with ACLs), Vault's dynamic secret backends are capable of generating database login credentials, Amazon IAM users, and even certificates! Vault handles leasing, key revocation, key rolling, and auditing. This talk will not only discuss the underlying architecture of Vault, but also includes an interactive live demo of the most common features in Vault. Some topics include: Initializing a Vault, understanding secrets and leases, mounting and configuring secret backends with Vault, configuring and parsing audit backends with Vault."
