description: "One of the best things about lambda is that it is backward-compatible with inner classes. If an inner class provides a single abstract method (SAM), a lambda can be substituted at the call site. JavaFX is a significant code base that was designed with lambda in mind and has recently been  lambda-ized.  This session discusses the approach that was used, the tooling, metrics, and subtle problems encountered.\n\n\nAuthors:\nFelipe Heidrich\nFelipe is an engineer on the JavaFX team at Oracle.
