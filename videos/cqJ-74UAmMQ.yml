title: 'Conquering Common Conundrums with ConstraintLayout by Huyen Tue Dao, Trello EN'
language: English
recordingDate: 1592403346
description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2020 by Huyen Tue Dao, Trello.\n\nMore info: https://android-makers-2020.firebaseapp.com/schedule/?sessionId=176513\n\nConstraintLayout was announced at Google I/O 2016, but even after 4 years of improvements, additions, and fixes, it can still be a little daunting to get started with ConstraintLayout. Even if you've been using it for a while, the sheer volume of functionality and possibility can be overwhelming. You might have a nagging feeling that you are not using ConstraintLayout in \"the right away\" or at least not using it to its full potential.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we're going to look at common layout problems and ask common layout questions, and start solving them with ConstraintLayout, exploring why and when we might choose some features and functionality over others and building a basic set of tools and techniques. Hopefully, after this talk, ConstraintLayout will feel less overwhelming with a fundamental toolset upon which you can build as you conquer increasingly complex layouts."
