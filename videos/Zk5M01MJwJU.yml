language: English
recordingDate: 1616503376
description: "Agile Tour Vilnius 2020. The New Normal\n\nAgile leadership and organization has always been an answer to uncertainty, complexity and speed. On top of the already existing uncertainty came the Corona-crisis adding even more uncertainty on all levels. Some call for strong leadership and guidance demonstrated by a strong authority. Some call for even more self-organization, trust and freedom to act. Already existing dilemmas became even more visible and have been amplified. In this keynote a few hypotheses will be outlined on how the Corona-crisis might affect the way we lead and collaborate in the future."
