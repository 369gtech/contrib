description: "CLI Plugin to Enhance Your Cloud - Simon Leung & Jonathan Berkhahn, IBM\n\nCloud Foundry is fully featured, however, there are moments when we wish it had come with those 1 or 2 extra features; could be features to make administratorâ€™s life a little easier, or it could be tools to utilize environment specific features. CLI (Command Line Interface) plugin is among one of the easiest ways for providers to customize Cloud Foundry. Come learn about how the plugin framework available as part of the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface can be used to provide new features to end users quickly and easily, with real life examples of how it helps operators and end users. See how plugins leverage the portability and distribution architecture of the CF CLI to deliver features to users easily regardless of architecture or operating system. You too can utilize plugins to provide new functionality and interact with infrastructure built around and on top of Cloud Foundry.\n\nJonathan Berkhahn\nIBM\nSoftware Engineer\nJonathan Berkhahn is an IBM software engineer that has been a Cloud Foundry core contributor for over 2 years. His work includes improvements to the CF CLI such as the CLI plugin interface and the V3 Cloud Controller API. He also works as an agile evangelist within IBM, driving use of new technologies and programming methodologies. He currently works on the Runtime_OG team at the new CF Dojo in RTP, supporting the legacy runtime components of Cloud Foundry.\n\nSimon Leung\nIBM\nSimon is one of the early Dojo program participant and has been working on varies Cloud Foundry projects for almost 2 years.
