description: "Erlang User Conference 2013\nMore info and slides on the website: http://www.erlang-factory.com/conference/ErlangUserConference2013/talks \n\nDatabases and web applications are intrinsically linked. But while people still separate both, we thought that we could innovate in the refuge project and embrace the new paradigms and standards that design what the web will be tomorrow. Erlang OTP could help a lot with that and most of the refuge platform is using it.\n\nThis talk will present a new way to exchange, render and use your data over the web by using Erlang and OTP to create a gateway or a thin layer between client applications and backends with the help of webrtc and websockets standards."
