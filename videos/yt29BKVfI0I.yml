description: "Jonathan Corbet\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/146/\n\nBack by popular demand: an overview of what the kernel development community has been up to and what can be expected in the near future.  Attendees will gain a better understanding of what has been happening in this huge and fast-moving project â€” and what the current challenges are.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/\n\n#linux.conf.au #linux #foss #opensource"
