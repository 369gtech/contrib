description: 'Functions, and the so called serverless computing have freed deveopers from worring about infrastructure, and even upper platform layers, as well some steps in the software development lifecycle. But once you have functions deployed, how do they interact with each other? How message navigates between them? Maybe, just maybe, it''s time to look back again at EIPs - Enterprise Integration Patterns, and their use in this new way of deploying code to the Cloud. This talk will cover primarily the use of one of the key EIP frameworks - Apache Camel - and top patterns applicable to Serverless Computing using Functions services by Cloud vendors as part of the demonstrations.'
