description: "Are you one of those people who search around the world looking for clues on how to get Maven to do your bidding, or do you just flip a coin and get lucky one more time? Maven works OK, but there’s a new tool in town that goes beyond Maven: Gradle. It’s fresh, almost aerodynamic. Once you get in contact with it, you’ll feel like doin’ it right when building a project. We kid you not, it’s an instant crush for those who have followed the Maven path, as you’ll find out in this session. This is the prime time of your life as a developer. Make the most out of it by leveraging the best tools.\n\n\nAuthors:\nAndres Almiray\nAndres is a Java/Groovy developer and a Java Champion with more than 12 years of experience in software design and development.
