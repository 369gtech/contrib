description: "Continuous integration and deployment is often treated as an afterthought, resulting in rigid, inefficient, and sometimes counterproductive processes. Modern tools such as cloud-native buildpacks, Concourse, Spinnaker, and Cloud Foundry (PAS and PKS) make it easier to stand up end-to-end automation for application delivery. Contract-based testing, database schema versioning, and metrics-based canary deployment techniques help increase the quality of your deployments. We'll demonstrate a reference pipeline that employs these tools and techniques to achieve end-to-end automation.\n\nLearn more: https://pv.tl/2P9Ys7Z\n\nThis talk will help enterprises overcome the entry barrier to put modern CI/CD into practice. Join us to see how you can get closer to the utopia of DevOps by removing friction from your delivery process.\n\nSpeakers: Cora Iberkleid, Advisory Platform Architect, Pivotal and Madhav Sathe, Senior Platform Architect, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2019\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/square-pegs-square-holes-cicd-that-fits"
