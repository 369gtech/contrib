description: "Norfolk Developers - 4th June 2014\n\nNorfolk Developers held their own technical version of the popular radio 4 show Just a Minute. Four contestants will attempt speak on technical subjects for a minute without:\n\n- hesitation \n- repetition \n- deviation\n\nA contestant scores a point for making a correct challenge against whomever is speaking, while the speaker gets a point if the challenge is deemed incorrect. However, if a witty interjection amuses the audience, even though it is not a correct challenge, both the challenger and speaker may gain a point, at the chairman's discretion. A player who makes a correct challenge takes over the subject for the remainder of the minute, or until he or she is correctly challenged. The person speaking when the 60 seconds expires also scores a point. An extra point is awarded when a panellist speaks for the entire minute without being challenged. \n\nThis is guaranteed to be an entertaining evening. \n\nWe had:\n\nDom Davis \nSean Clark \nSteve Engledow\nChris Yallop\n\nhttp://www.meetup.com/Norfolk-Developers-NorDev/events/184896552/"
