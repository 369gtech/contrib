title: 'Using Elixir to get the fun back in Lego Mindstorms - Torben Hoffmann - Erlang User Conference 2015'

description: "Slides and more info: http://www.erlang-factory.com/euc2015/torben-hoffmann\n\nRobots are fun. Programming is fun. Programming Lego robots with the visual environment... well, not so fun. This is the starting point for putting Elixir on the Lego Mindstorms EV3. It ought to be fun to do, but my son and I got lost in the visual environment when trying to do advanced things. After having created a simple EV3 library in Elixir the fun started coming back. This talk is about how the EV3 Elixir library works and how to use it to make robot control software that is easy to write and understand. One of the key building blocks in Elixir - as in Erlang - is processes, and we will have a look at how to design things using lots of processes and how that makes things easier to work with. We start from conceptual architecture and end with elegant Elixir programs. As we go along a visual notation that fits the domain will be introduced showing the benefits of having a small semantic gap between domain, architecture and language.\n\nTalk objectives:\n\n- Show how using lots of processes with asynchronous message passing create super solutions in Elixir.\n\n- Inspire people to hack Elixir on Lego Mindstorms EV3.\n\nTarget audience:\n\nProgrammers longing for a nice and fun way to work with their Lego Mindstorms.\n\nTorben is the CTO of Erlang Solutions and has been working with Erlang in Motorola and Issuu as technical architect and developer since 2006. He has talked about his Motorola achievements at Erlang eXchange 2008 and EUC 2010. He has been holding the Erlang banner high as a self confessed Erlang Priest at several conferences such as CodeMesh, Build Stuff, GOTO, QCon, Craft and Lambda Days. Before becoming an Erlanger he worked with software quality assurance, process improvement and people management."
