description: "I always list this talk as an option, as it remains very popular at many conferences. It also draws a full room each time. The shift towards an API landscape indicates a significant evolution in the way we build applications. The rise of JavaScript and mobile applications have sparked an explosion of easily-accessible REST APIs. But how do you protect access to your API? Which security aspects are no longer relevant? Which security features are an absolutely must-have, and which additional security measures do you need to take into account?\n\nThese are hard questions, as evidenced by the deployment of numerous insecure APIs. Attend this session to find out about common API security pitfalls, that often result in compromised user accounts and unauthorized access to your data. We expose the problem that lies at the root of each of these pitfalls, and offer actionable advice to address these security problems. After this session, you will know how to assess the security of your APIs, and the best practices to improve them towards the future.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks, courses, and conferences in the following links:\nhttps://ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-security.com/"
