Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nSo You Want to Geo-Partition Your Data... - Deepthi Sigireddi & Jiten Vaidya, Planetscale, Inc. \n\nOne of the distinguishing features of Vitess is its support for flexible sharding schemes. In this talk Deepthi and Jiten will show how this can be used to build a custom sharding scheme that respects geo-partitioning requirements. They will then demonstrate a database cluster built using this scheme that solves data residency at the database layer obviating the need for any changes at the application layer."
