title: 'Webinar: Trivy Open Source Scanner for Container Images – Just Download and Run!'
language: English
recordingDate: 1591218393
description: "Looking for an open source scanner for container images? Welcome to Trivy! It’s very easy to use – just download and run – and it detects vulnerabilities in both OS packages and application dependencies.\nJoin us for this webinar during which Teppei Fukuda will be talking about getting started with Trivy, using it in your CI workflow and running it as a server. Also, he is going to explain how to use Trivy in Harbor, which recently decided to include Trivy as one of the default scanners. He will explain how Trivy works and why the geeks amongst us love the way it stores its vulnerability data in GitHub so that getting daily updates is as simple as a git pull. You’ll also get a sneak preview of some the ideas we’re working on at Aqua Security to extend Trivy and make it even more deserving of your GitHub stars!\n\nPresenter:\n\nTeppei Fukuda, Open Source Engineer @Aqua Security"
