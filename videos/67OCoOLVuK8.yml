How can modern C++ help? \n\nWe take a look at the interprocess communication subsystem of the Nintendo 3DS and see how generative programming tools (variadic templates, function reflection, metaprogramming) and a declarative approach give us wins in performance, maintainability, and correctness. \n\nThe takeaway of this session is a glimpse at generators, declarative interfaces, and how to use them to solve serialization-like problems with minimal effort and maximum reusability. \n— \nTony Wasserka\nFreelance Software Developer\n\nLow-level anything: Tony is a freelancer and long-term C++ enthusiast who has worked on the console emulator projects Dolphin (GameCube/Wii), PPSSPP (PSP), and Citra (3DS) since 2010. More recently, he has worked on Vulkan graphics drivers for PowerVR graphics processors. His main interest is exploring C++'s zero-cost abstraction capabilities and applying them to create better software for resource-constrained environments.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
