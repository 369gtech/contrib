description: "Google Tech Talk\nOctober 27, 2014\nPresented by Robin Morisset\n\nABSTRACT\n\nAtomics in C11 and C++11 let the programmer express the guarantees needed for racy accesses in lock-free code, in theory bringing a zero-cost abstraction for parallelism to the language. This talk will showcase how you can use atomics today and where the abstraction breaks down. We’ll focus on LLVM’s recent improvements for atomics that provide significant performance gains on ARMv7, Power and x86. Finally we’ll discuss some extremely non-intuitive behaviors of atomics, how atomics in C++ may evolve, and how it may impact LLVM.\n\nSlides can be found here:\nhttps://docs.google.com/a/chromium.org/presentation/d/1Ok3NHezdnKLD4XSzI8WVwdMC07DR3w87n80Mj5ydtGE\n\nSpeaker Info:\n\nRobin Morisset interned in Chrome's NaCl team for the summer, and focused on tuning C11/C++11 atomics in LLVM for x86/ARM/Power. He is a PhD Student at the ENS Paris."
