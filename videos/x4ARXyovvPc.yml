description: "Ever wondered what semantic versioning is? In this Classic Epsiode of Route 85, Todd explains to Robbie what semantic versioning is all about, and how the squiggly arrow (also known as a twiddle-wakka) in your Podfile can affect CocoaPod's behavior when you call `pod update`. Along the way, we learn the difference between a minor and a patch release, and see Todd's darker side. It's not pretty.\n\nWatch more episodes of Route 85 here:\nhttps://goo.gl/ctvYzw\n\nSubscribe to the Google Developers channel at http://goo.gl/mQyv5L"
