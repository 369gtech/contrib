description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2014\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nRussell Miles - Co-Author of Head First Software Development\n\nABSTRACT\nMany organisations have been swept up in agile process adoption, with good reasons! The Agile Party is coming to a close and many organisations are now beginning to look at where they are and have come to the disheartening realisation that, rather than in a new world of embracing change and competitiveness, they have a lot of new processes, not much to show for it, and people are disillusioned enough to begin to revert to older, familiar ways… \n\nThis is the unfortunate age of the ‘agile hangover’.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
