recordingDate: 1472724002
description: 'We at TO THE NEW Digital had to build a live streaming application for our client #fame. The challenges were immense. It was the GR8 eco-system that came to our rescue. In this session I will share my experience of using GR8 technologies like Groovy, Grails, Boot, etc for building this live streaming application. I will talk about how these set of tools and technologies helped us in doing some quick PoCs, coming up with quick working models and growing them into the whole system. We will take a look at the architecture of the application, and how we are moving forward in creating a scalable system while having a solid foundation of these Gr8 techonolgies'
