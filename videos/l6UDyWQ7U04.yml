description: "Speaker: Gabe Hollombe\n\nThis talk will feature a list of quick-hitting tips aimed at improving your day-to-day life building on AWS. I'll cover working effectively with the AWS CLI and other third-party CLIs; creating, editing, debugging, and deploying an AWS Lambda-powered serverless applications quickly and easily using the new AWS Toolkit which works with VS code and other IDEs; and introducing the concept of structured logging and how to perform powerful filtering and searches on your structured application logs with Amazon CloudWatch.\n\nThe talk also has some fun history lessons that have nothing to do with AWS, so even if you're not into the cloud, you might enjoy learning a bit about the history of CLIs, IDEs, and logging data.\n\nProfile:\nHello! I'm Gabe and I work as a Developer Advocate at AWS, where I try to stay up-to-date on new technology and share what I'm learning with the world.\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/gabehollombe/\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/Junior-Developers-Singapore/events/271450434/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\r\nRecorded by: Michael"
