Following Pointers are covered in this GPT-3 explained video:\n00:00:57 Introduction to GPT\n00:02:50 Practical Applications of GPT Deep Learning Model\n00:04:54 Datasets and Parameters used in GPT 3\n00:06:44 Limitations of GPT Algorithm\n00:08:14 How you can use GPT\n\n\nüîπCheck our complete Deep Learning With TensorFlow playlist here: https://goo.gl/cck4hE \nüîπCheck our complete Deep Learning With TensorFlow Blog Series: http://bit.ly/2sqmP4s  \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nüî¥Do subscribe to our channel and hit the bell icon to never miss an update from us in the future: https://goo.gl/6ohpTV \n\nEdureka Community: https://bit.ly/EdurekaCommunity\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/edureka_learning/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/edurekaIN/ \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/edurekain \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/edureka \nTelegram: https://t.me/edurekaupdates \nSlideShare: https://www.slideshare.net/EdurekaIN \nMeetup: https://www.meetup.com/edureka/    \n\n#Edureka #EdurekaTensorFlow #GPT3 #Tensorflowtutorial #tensorflow2.0 #TensorFlowTraining #Edureka #EdurekaTraining\n\n--------------------------\n\nHow it Works?\n\n1. This is 21 hrs of Online Live Instructor-led course. Weekend class: 7 sessions of 3 hours each.\n2. We have a 24x7 One-on-One LIVE Technical Support to help you with any problems you might face or any clarifications you may require during the course.\n3. At the end of the training you will have to undergo a 2-hour LIVE Practical Exam based on which we will provide you a Grade and a Verifiable Certificate!\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nAbout the Course\n\nEdureka's Deep learning with Tensorflow course will help you to learn the basic concepts of TensorFlow, the main functions, operations and the execution pipeline. Starting with a simple ‚ÄúHello Word‚Äù example, throughout the course you will be able to see how TensorFlow can be used in curve fitting, regression, classification and minimization of error functions. This concept is then explored in the Deep Learning world. You will evaluate the common, and not so common, deep neural networks and see how these can be exploited in the real world with complex raw data using TensorFlow. In addition, you will learn how to apply TensorFlow for backpropagation to tune the weights and biases while the Neural Networks are being trained. Finally, the course covers different types of Deep Architectures, such as Convolutional Networks, Recurrent Networks and Autoencoders. \n\nDelve into neural networks, implement Deep Learning algorithms, and explore layers of data abstraction with the help of this Deep Learning with TensorFlow course.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - \nWho should go for this course?\n\nThe following professionals can go for this course:\n1. Developers aspiring to be a 'Data Scientist'\n2. Analytics Managers who are leading a team of analysts \n3. Business Analysts who want to understand Deep Learning (ML) Techniques\n4. Information Architects who want to gain expertise in Predictive Analytics\n5. Professionals who want to captivate and analyze Big Data\n6. Analysts wanting to understand Data Science methodologies\n\nHowever, Deep learning is not just focused to one particular industry or skill set, it can be used by anyone to enhance their portfolio. \n\nFor more information, please write back to us at sales@edureka.in or call us at IND: 9606058406 / US: 18338555775"
