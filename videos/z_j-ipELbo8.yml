description: "Thanks to our Community Sponsors: Honeycomb.io and CircleCI.com\n\nSpeaker: Kristen Belcher (Senior Agile Coach, Vertafone)\n\nAs leaders in technology, we’re problem-solvers. We’re practised in having good answers, and we are often promoted based on our ability to provide the “right answers” - solutions to business problems. But what about asking the “right questions”?\n\nSome questions get you a quick response, while others get you an in-depth dissertation. Some are thought-provoking, while others are stifling. The questions you ask and the way in which you ask them can empower and inspire teams and individuals to achieve greatness. In this session, we’ll explore the concept of powerful questions.\n\nWe’ll dive into what makes a question powerful and how these powerful questions are leveraged to unlock greater success for yourself, your teams, and your organization."
