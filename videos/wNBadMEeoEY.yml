description: "In this webinar, Matt Wynne CEO of Cucumber will show you how you can:\n\n- Publish feature files as gorgeous living documentation direct from source control\n- Version those documents, using git branches and Releases\n- Collaborate around the feature files using in-line conversations\n- Publish test results to Cucumber Pro for extra confidence in the documentation\n\nFinally, we’ll look at how you can bring all this together with release approval - allowing business stakeholders to sign off on the requirements, test cases and test results for each release of your product with a single click.\n\nYou should watch if you:\n\n- are already invested in BDD as an organisation and ready to \n- amplify that investment\n- want to empower product owners to stay involved in the BDD process from beginning to end\n- need an in-house appliance installation of Cucumber Pro to keep your feature files secure\n- have the clout to access the necessary infrastructure to set up an appliance: a Linux server/VM, SMTP & LDAP access, firewall configuration etc.\n\nWant to become a Cucumber Pro appliance customer?
