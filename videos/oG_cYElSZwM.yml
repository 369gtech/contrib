description: "Join us for #RenderConf 2018: https://goo.gl/iXs1mJ\n\nSlides: http://bit.ly/render2017slides\n\nAll too often we think about accessibility as just meeting the needs of those who rely on screenreaders, but it's far wider than that!\n\nSeren will explore how people with cognitive, physical, hearing and sight difficulties experience the web, and how the decisions we make as developers affect their experience.\n\nABOUT SEREN DAVIES\n\nSeren is a final year Software Engineering student at Oxford Brookes. In-between studying and promoting accessibility she can can be found doing the occasional bit of nail art."
