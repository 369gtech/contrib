We’ll demystify the journey your source code takes from textual representation to bytes executing on your processor. If you’ve ever wondered how the myriad of tools involved in translating and running C++ operate and fit together, then this talk is for you.\n\nTopics covered will include stages of compilation, linkers, static/shared libraries, object file loading, operating system interaction, and maybe some apple pie.\n\nPeter Bindels\nSoftware Engineer, TomTom\n\nSimon Brand\nMicrosoft\nC++ Developer Advocate\nEdinburgh, Scotland\nSimon is Microsoft’s C++ Developer Advocate. Their background is in compilers and debuggers for embedded accelerators, but they’re also interested in generic library design, metaprogramming, functional-style C++, undefined behaviour, and making our communities more welcoming and inclusive.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
