description: "https://cppcon.org/\nhttps://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2020\n---\nClang-tidy is the go-to assistant for most C++ programmers looking to improve their code, whether to modernize it or to find hidden bugs with its built-in checks. Static analysis is great, but you also get tons of false positives. \n\nNow that you’re hooked on smart tools, you have to try dynamic/runtime analysis. After years of improvements and successes for Clang and GCC users, LLVM AddressSanitizer (ASan) is finally available on Windows, in the latest Visual Studio 2019 versions. Let's find out how this experience is for MSVC projects. \n\nWe’ll see how AddressSanitizer works behind the scenes (compiler and ASan runtime) and analyze the instrumentation impact, both in perf and memory footprint. We’ll examine a handful of examples diagnosed by ASan and see how easy it is to read memory snapshots in Visual Studio, to pinpoint the failure. \n\nWant to unleash the memory vulnerability beast? Put your test units on steroids, by spinning fuzzing jobs with ASan in Azure, leveraging the power of the Cloud from the comfort of your Visual Studio IDE. \n\n---\nVictor Ciura is a Principal Engineer at CAPHYON, Technical Lead on the Advanced Installer team and a Microsoft MVP (Developer Technologies).\n\nHe’s a regular guest at Computer Science Department of his Alma Mater, University of Craiova, where he gives student lectures & workshops on using C++ STL Algorithms.\n\nSince 2005, he has been designing and implementing several core components and libraries of Advanced Installer. Currently, he spends most of his time working with his team on improving and extending the repackaging and virtualization technologies in Advanced Installer IDE, helping clients migrate their traditional desktop apps to the modern Windows application format: MSIX.\n\nOne of his “hobbies” is tidying-up and modernizing (C++17) the aging codebase of Advanced Installer and has been known to build tools that help this process: Clang Power Tools\n---\n\nStreamed & Edited by Digital Medium Ltd - events.digital-medium.co.uk\nevents@digital-medium.co.uk"
