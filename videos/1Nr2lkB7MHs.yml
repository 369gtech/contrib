description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2012\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nJaime Wren - Software Engineer at the Google Dart Team\n\nABSTRACT\nDart Editor is a lightweight, open-source editor for writing Dart applications. I will demonstrate how the editor helps you efficiently write modern web apps with Dart. After creating a Dart application we'll quickly navigate and search through Dart source, and accurately write code with refactoring and code completion tools. You'll also see how the editor connects to Dartium (Chromium with the Dart VM) for a fast development and debugging experience.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
