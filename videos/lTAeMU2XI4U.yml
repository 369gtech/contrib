description: "There is an increasing abundance of tools, languages, and frameworks for data visualization. But success is built upon having a good design to implement, and that requires a linear process of encoding information for visual transmission and subsequent decoding by wetware (the reader's brain). Join us as we introduce you to this process, including some basic concepts and best practices, so that your message may be transmitted without interference.\n\nAbout Julie Steele:\nJulie is an editor at O'Reilly Media interested in connecting people and ideas. She finds beauty in discovering new ways to understand complex systems, and so enjoys topics related to gathering, storing, analyzing, and visualizing data. She holds a Master's degree in Political Science (International Relations) from Rutgers University. Julie also works with topics related to the languages Python, PHP and SQL, and is co-founder of a group of non-programmers learning Python. Julie lives in NYC where she eats, reads, codes, and practices yoga.\n\nAbout Noah Iliinsky:\nNoah has spent the last several years thinking about effective approaches to creating diagrams and other types of information visualization. He also works in interface and interaction design, all from a functional and user-centered perspective. Before becoming a designer he was a programmer for several years. He has a master's in Technical Communication from the University of Washington, and a bachelor's in Physics from Reed College."
