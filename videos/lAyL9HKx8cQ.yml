description: "Ok, so you know your Docker. You know how to create images and start containers. That’s cool, but where do we go from here? Well, all the cool kids are talking about Kubernetes and container orchestrators, and how they are like magic pixie dust to your applications. How they allow you to create solutions that are automatically load balanced, self-healing and even provides seamless rolling updates that allow you to release new versions with zero downtime. And knowing you, you probably want some of that too!\n\nHonestly though, it isn’t magic, and It won’t “just work”! It can seem pretty close to magic though, but as long as you understand how it works, you can use it to bring your applications hosting to the next level. With the operative words being “understand it”… Unless you know what you are doing, it can’t really help you…but that’s where this talk comes in!\n\nIn this talk, we will start out by looking at how you can set up your local development environment to run Kubernetes based applications. After that, we will look at the architectural building blocks that make up Kubernetes , and then go on to look at some of the great features that Kubernetes give you, and how you can take advantage of them in your projects.\n\nMost Kubernetes talks tend to focus on the DevOps side of things. And even if that’s where Kubernetes has the most impact, there are still quite a few things for us developers to understand before we can build applications that can be allowed in to the Kubernetes world.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks, courses, and conferences in the following links:\nhttps://ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
