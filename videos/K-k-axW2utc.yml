description: "Bridging Languages Cross-Platform: Djinni Implementation Techniques\n--\nhttp://www.Cppcon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2015\n—\nDropbox has been using C++ for cross-platform development on mobile platforms since 2012. In 2014 we open-sourced Djinni, our code generator that bridges C++ to other languages. In this talk we'll dive deep into some implementation techniques we use to bridge languages, easily, flexibly, and efficiently. We'll use the recent addition of Python-to-C++ bridging as an example of the challenges and decisions which come up when building a bridge between two very different languages, as well as talking about some interesting challenges we faced in Java and Objective-C.  Topics include marshaling data-types, cross-language object ownership and identity, template-generated cached proxy objects, and translation of exceptions. What you learn should arm you to bridge languages for your own needs, or use/extend Djinni for your own programs. No prior knowledge of Djinni or mobile development required, but intermediate C++ will be assumed, and a bit of Python will be useful.\n— \nJacob Potter is a recovering embedded systems engineer who is now driving Dropbox’s use of modern C++ for cross-platform mobile development. He's also the primary maintainer of Djinni, the tool Dropbox uses for generating cross-language bindings.\n\nAndrew Twyman has been developing products and libraries in C++ for almost 10 years. He loves building robust systems and solving tricky low-level problems. Starting in 2012, Andrew helped spearhead Dropbox’s new approach to cross-platform mobile development. Now on the Platforms and Libraries team, Andrew is helping bring cross-platform goodness to Dropbox’s new generation of mobile and desktop apps. Prior to Dropbox, Andrew was an architect at Liquid Machines, where shared libraries supported parallel development of more products than there were developers.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
