description: "Learn how to use TensorFlow 2 for computer vision in this complete course. The course shows you how to create two computer vision projects. The first involves an image classification model with a prepared dataset. The second is a more real-world problem where you will have to clean and prepare a dataset before using it.\n\n💻 Code: https://github.com/sniper0110/IntroductionToTensorflow2\n✏️ Nour Islam Mokhtari created this course.
