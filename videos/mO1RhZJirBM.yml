description: "Making your Python code write your Python code Discover Python's 'ast' module to see how you can analyze and generate Python code\nby Marcin Sobczyk\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/UD2.120/python_ast_module.webm\n\n\nHave you ever wondered how much of your code could be generated automatically? Introspection, mutation, extension - Python's uber-dynamic nature allows us to do all kinds of kinky stuff. In this presentation we will take a look at the 'ast' module and see how it allows us to analyze and produce Python code. By leveraging it's power, we will try to create useful tools and even our own DSLs! \n\nRoom: UD2.120 (Chavanne)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 12:00:00+01"
