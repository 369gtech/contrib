description: "The HTTP/2 spec is here - clients are servers are racing to implement it, while browser support is increasing everyday... The JVM world is already working on it in the Servlet 4.0 and JDK9 specs.\n\nBut we developers, are still trying to understand the implications of it. Should we reconsider the way we build JavaScript applications and optimize them for front-end performance? Will our server application have new roles and abilities?\n\nIn this talk we'll look at the main features of HTTP/2 to understand how it will dramatically improve latency on the web. We'll also discuss with concrete examples how HTTP/2 could be integrated in our front-end and Java Web applications."
