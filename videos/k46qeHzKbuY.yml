description: "https://2019.jsconfbp.com/speakers/braden_moore\n\nEarly last year, my colleagues and I did something amazing — using only JavaScript, the browser, and the Web Audio API, we were able to decipher brainwaves. It sounds sensational, but it’s (mostly) true. This is a story about how we converted brainwaves into audio signals — and then back again — to solve the problem of epilepsy diagnosis on the web.\n\nIn this talk, you’ll get to see a new browser API being used in a novel and unprecedented way, combined with world-leading innovations in the field of epilepsy diagnosis. You’ll learn about the challenges of real-time brainwave filtering and how we solved them. As you’ll see, the technologies we use each day can sometimes be applied in unexpected ways. And sometimes, they make a huge difference in the lives of others.\n\nCome along for the journey as we decipher brainwaves in the browser.\n\nA former particle physicist, Braden left behind the world of hadron colliders and dark matter to become a web developer. After picking up JavaScript, he's never looked back. In his spare time, Braden is an avid writer and an aspiring fencer, and hopes to one day compete in the Olympics."
