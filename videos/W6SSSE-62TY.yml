description: "\"Where do I start?\" How many times have you asked yourself this when you are about to add a new functionality to your project? Developers deal with daily decision problems that affect huge code bases and little time to come with solutions. In this talk we will build the famous Simon Says game for Android to show how we can come up with a solution parting from requirements that are turned into very specific test cases. Along the way we will see the advantages that Kotlin provides us and a small sample of the power that Arrow can add to your Android project incorporating functional programming. \n\n\nAbout:\nRocío Ortega Priego, Android Engineer, Habitissimo\n\nRocío Ortega is an Android Engineer.
