description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nSponsored Session: Kubernetes Package Management Using Unix Philosophy with Carvel - Helen George & João Pereira, VMware\n\nSharing of Personal Information with Sponsors In order to facilitate networking and business relationships at the event, you may choose to visit a third partyʼs virtual booth or to access sponsored content. You are never required to visit third party booths or to access sponsored content. When visiting a booth (e.g. by clicking on a third partyʼs logo in the Solutions Showcase or exhibitor directory, and any actions within the booth thereafter including viewing resources), when accessing sponsored sessions in the Sponsor Theater, or by participating in sponsored activities, the third party will receive some of your registration data. This data includes your first name, last name, title, company, address, email, standard demographics questions (i.e. job function, industry), and details about the sponsored content or resources you interacted with. If you choose to interact with a virtual booth or access sponsored content, you are explicitly consenting to receipt and use of such data by the third-party recipients, which will be subject to their own privacy policies.\n\nManaging hundreds or thousands of workloads on a Kubernetes cluster is not an easy task. On top of that, dealing with various workflows to customize and deploy applications can pose even more of a challenge. No single Kubernetes tool is going to solve everyone’s problem, and as an operator you might be forced to use multiple kubernetes tools to manage a single Kubernetes cluster. But then there’s no guarantee that these tools are going to work well together seamlessly.\n\nCarvel is a suite of open-source projects that aims to solve these problems. It provides a set of reliable, single-purpose, composable tools that aid in your application building, packaging, configuration, and deployment to Kubernetes. Carvel enables users to get software installed and keep it updated on a Kubernetes cluster in a secure, scalable, and automated way.\n\nIn this session, João Pereira and Helen George will explore how the whole suite of Carvel tools (ytt, kbld, kapp, imgpkg, kapp-controller) work and show how you can integrate them for managing packages on Kubernetes. We’ll look at a few concrete examples where Carvel can be used as a part of your toolchain together with Helm Charts, kustomize and http library."
