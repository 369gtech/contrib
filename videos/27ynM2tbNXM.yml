He will then be introducing Netflix's Eureka (https://github.com/Netflix/eureka); a highly-available, multi-datacenter aware service discovery solution built from scratch, it's architecture and how it is unique in this space, by favoring Availability over Consistency in the wake of network partitions.\n\nNitesh Kant\nNETFLIX\n@NiteshKant\n\nNitesh Kant is an engineer in Netflix's Cloud Platform team, working on their Inter Process Communication stack.
