title: 'Building Systems with Asynchronous Microservices'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433261049
description: "Asynchronous and event-driven programming models are hugely popular for building and designing large, scalable systems. Services can help compose these systems; OSGi has offered a dynamic, modular, type-safe, and failure-tolerant microservices container for more than a decade. What’s more, the latest release of OSGi offers built-in support for asynchronous microservices. This session demonstrates how a modular microservice platform can be used to build up an application with a mixture of synchronous and asynchronous call semantics. Further, it describes how remote microservices can provide the perfect opportunity to transparently scale across machine boundaries with efficient, nonblocking interaction patterns.\n\n\nAuthor:\nTim Ward\nTim Ward is a Senior Consulting Engineer and Trainer at Paremus, a co-author of Enterprise OSGi in Action, and has been actively working with OSGi for over six years.
