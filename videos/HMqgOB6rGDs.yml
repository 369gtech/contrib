description: "Your Kubernetes app is down. Your users start ranting on Twitter. Your boss is standing right behind you. What do you do now?\nThis talk walks you through a live debugging session without panicking:\n* What do your health checks say?\n* Where does your monitoring point you?\n* Can you get more details from your applicationâ€™s traces?\n* Is there anything helpful in the logs?\n* What the heck is even deployed?\nWe are using the open source Elastic Stack with a special focus on its Kubernetes integration with metadata enrichment and autodiscovery in combination with APM / tracing, metrics, logs, and health checks."
