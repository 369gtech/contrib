description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nHandling Container Vulnerabilities with Open Policy Agent - Teppei Fukuda, Aqua Security \n\nA vulnerability scanner for containers doesn’t help a user decide how to handle vulnerabilities. For example, even if a critical vulnerability is found, some organizations may accept the risk of it. The policy for vulnerability handling depends on the organization, and in many cases, the person in charge has to make a manual judgement based on this policy every time. This is time-consuming.  This talk demonstrates how to automatically handle vulnerabilities detected by a scanner using OPA. - The vulnerabilities found by a scanner in CI are handled automatically by Open Policy Agent - Applying custom policy, OPA shows users which vulnerabilities to address  This automatic vulnerability handling in CI will be demonstrated live, along with Trivy, which is an open source vulnerability scanner for containers. The same policy handling model could be used with any scanner.\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zekd"
