Network layer designing is one of the most important career projects for every software engineer. However, we often limit ourselves to the opportunities that REST provides. \nIn the talk we go through the original solution developed by Google — GRPC. It’s a brand new, very fast and flexible RPC framework. This framework solves a number of structural issues and makes a network logic much easier to implement. \n\nGeneral Partner – Verv (https://verv.com/) \nVideo Partner – Instabug (https://instabug.com/)"
