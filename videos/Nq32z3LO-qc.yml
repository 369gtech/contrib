description: "Learn how to control access to sensitive information at a node and edge level. This session will show how to use Oracle Label Security with property graphs.\n\nControl of access to sensitive information is of concern to managers, information officers, DBAs, application developers, and many others. Oracle Label Security (OLS) is part of Oracle’s defense-in-depth approach to security and is the industry’s most advanced solution for controlling access to data based on data classification. Government agencies align their data classification standards and then use OLS to share data across agencies. Commercial companies use OLS to separate data by geographic boundaries, allowing users from different countries to access data and meet local privacy and compliance requirements.\n\nThis session demonstrates how to apply data classification (e.g. Highly Sensitive, Sensitive, Unclassified) to property graph nodes (e.g. bank accounts) and edges (transactions between these accounts) and control user’s access to these elements.\n\n01:30 Overview of this session\n04:37 Property Graph support in the database\n11:32 What is Oracle Label Security\n16:04 Demo scenario\n19:00 Demo (Setting policies and access rights)\n28:03 Demo (PGQL query results on Database)\n32:26 Demo (PGQL query results on Graph Server)\n37:40 Demo (Inserting and deleting nodes and edges)\n39:40 Q&A\n43:48 Demo (Graph Visualization)\n\nAskTOM Office Hours offers free, monthly training and tips on how to make the most of Oracle Database, from Oracle product managers, developers and evangelists.\n\nhttps://asktom.oracle.com/  \n\nOracle Developers portal: https://developer.oracle.com/\nSign up for an Oracle Cloud trial: https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/"
