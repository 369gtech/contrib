title: 'GitOps by courtesy of Jenkins-X'
recordingDate: 1586857504
description: 'We have to write Kloud with K for some time now, since it is ruled mostly by Kubernetes (k8s). GitOps is an important new trend in DevOps. Jenkins-X (JX) brings not only software builds to k8s but also provides an integrated GitOps workflow. GitOps enables automatic and versioned Infrastructure-as-Code lifecycle management, i.e., setup and maintenance of k8s infrastructures based on Helm charts. The driving force at the core of JX is still the good old Java based Jenkins with its multiple application cases for Groovy, in particular the Jenkinsfile pipeline. The talk will introduce Jenkins-X from a developers point of view. JX will automatically set up a full blown continuous integration environment running on k8s in the twinkle of an eye. Additionally it makes the developer life much easier by providing create and import facilities for new and existing projects, or so-called devpods to develop Cloud-native applications directly in the target environment.'
