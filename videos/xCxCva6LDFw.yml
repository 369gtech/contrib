language: English
recordingDate: 1532330828
description: 'Starting from myself - I am a software developer and an active motorcycle driver. Actually a lot of my IT colleagues do ride a motorcycle. Is it a coincidence or The World is too lazy for coincidences? Both activities i.e. developing a software and riding a motorcycle do have some common aspects. Especially things that happens inside one’s head, especially in those moments when things go wrong. And when things go wrong, usually it starts in small, innocent things and ends with a big bang! In case of motorcycle diving so called “survival reactions” were proposed and researched. In short words these are a human reactions based on instinct, habits or assumptions that leads to a wrong decision and actions making - in the result to a crash. In the world of IT software developers also do have such “survival reactions” - this that one try to do to avoid issues with delivering project on time. Unintentionally a decision that should save the day leads to a even bigger problems in the longer run. Let me highlight common factors, requirements and qualities required both from developers and riders. Let me point situations when so called survival reactions in software development will lead unintentionally to a crash. A piece of full movie/book (book was bought first) that make me start to think about survival reactions in software development; https://youtu.be/wwU8My1IBW8?t=1m9s stream: software engineering, agile methodologies target audience: beginner/daily user/epert length: 15 minutes including discussion'
