He leads a variety of Java and JVM projects whose focus is on one, two or all three of these performance areas. He is the lead author of Java™ Performance (Addison-Wesley, 2012), and a co-author of Java™ Performance Companion (Addison-Wesley, 2016). He is a regular presenter at the JavaOne Conference where he has been recognized as a Java Rock Star. Charlie wrote his first Java application in 1998, joined Sun Microsystems in 1999 as Senior Java Architect, and has had a passion for Java and JVM performance ever since.\n\n\nhttps://developer.oracle.com/\nhttps://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/tryit"
