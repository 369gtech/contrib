description: I'm not an Android developer by far, but I've been working in a mobile
  development team as the DevOps guy, which basically translates to do anything that
  is not related to development proper. When I was introduced to the team, they had
  hacked something on a Bamboo server, based on custom Python scripts that uploaded
  the binaries to a Hockeykit server, completely decoupled from the Maven build and
  the Nexus repository. The they decided to switch to Gradle... In this presentation,
  I will describe how I migrated from this situation to a standard build on a full-fledged
  Jenkins server and more importantly the pain points I encountered regarding the
  provisioning of Gradle , the updates of the Android SDK platforms, extras and repositories
  and the management of Robolectric behind the entreprise proxy.
