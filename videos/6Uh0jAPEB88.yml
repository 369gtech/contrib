description: "Intro: Kubernetes (VMware) SIG - David vonThenen & Steven Wong, VMware \n\nIntro to the vSphere CSI Volume Driver The Container Storage Interface (CSI) is a specification designed to enable persistent storage volume management, using a plugin maintained independently of Kubernetes. Kubernetes CSI support recently advanced to GA. In the longer term, there is a plan to deprecate existing legacy storage plugins. New storage-related functionality, such as snapshot support, is now being targeted for CSI only. The “in-tree” vSphere storage plugin remains fully supported at this time. but users running Kubernetes on vSphere may wish to change to CSI to gain new features. At some point in the future, migration to the CSI plugin will become mandatory. This session will explain and demonstrate deployment, configuration and use of the new vSphere CSI driver. We will also cover migration and the roadmap for new functionality including snapshots, and other topics (e.g. interaction with scheduling and zones). \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPi1"
