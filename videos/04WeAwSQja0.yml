description: "Typically, the activities of a malware attack occur on an execution timeline that generally consists of 3 segmentsâ€”the vector, the stage, and the persistence. First, a vector, or method of exploitation is identified. This could be anything from logging in over a credentialed method like RDP or SSH and running a malicious payload directly, to exploiting a memory corruption vulnerability remotely. Second, that access is leveraged into running malicious code that prepares the victim for the deployment of persistence (commonly \"implant\"). While segments one and three have been extensively automated, a effective automated utility for deploying persistence in a dynamic and unified context has yet to present itself. \n\nEnter the Genesis Scripting Engine. \n\nThe Genesis Scripting Engine, or Gscript for short, is a framework for building multi-tenant executors for several implants in a stager. The engine works by embedding runtime logic (powered by the V8 Javascript Virtual Machine) for each persistence technique. This logic gets run at deploy time on the victim machine, in parallel for every implant contained with the stager. The Gscript engine leverages the multi-platform support of Golang to produce final stage one binaries for Windows, Mac, and Linux. \n\nThis talk will consist of an overview of the origins of the project, a technical deep dive into the inner workings including the modified Javascript VM, a walk through of the CLI utility, and examples of how we've leveraged Gscript in the real world. \n\nMultiple demos involving practical application scenarios will be presented, as well as an opportunity for audience members to submit their own implants and have them built into a hydra on stage in a matter of minutes."
