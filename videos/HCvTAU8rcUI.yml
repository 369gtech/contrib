Across many organizations, teams struggle to define “technical debt” and what should fall into the “tech debt” bucket. Testing commonly suffers the fate of being categorized as tech debt, and consequently isn’t prioritized. Defining tech debt, and even rebranding it, can help your team to prioritize testing and reduce the negative stigma around tech debt.\n\nThis event would not take place without the support of sponsors:\n\nPlatinum Sponsors\nSauce Labs → https://saucelabs.com/\n\nGold Sponsors\nStackHawk → https://www.stackhawk.com/\nNeuralegion → https://www.neuralegion.com/\n\nSilver Sponsor\nTestim → https://www.testim.io/\n\nProduction Partner\nFocus Reactive → https://focusreactive.com/"
