description: "Patrick Lightbody's keynote from the 2014 O'Reilly Velocity conference in Santa Clara, CA.\n\nThe challenge with traditional performance optimization work is that it's rarely clear if the effort is worth it. Sure, you can shave 5% off some page load or transaction time, but how do you know if the work required to do that was worth it, or if there was some more valuable work you could have spent your time on?\n\nThis question is something New Relic customers asked themselves every day. This is why New Relic built Insights, a database that can query over billions of individual interactions with your software. With this newfound power, you can begin to drill in on only the problems that affect your most important customers, ensuring that your performance optimization efforts have a great return on investment.\n\nThis keynote is sponsored by New Relic.\n\nAbout Patrick Lightbody (New Relic):\nPatrick came to New Relic after founding several startups, most recently BrowserMob (acquired by Neustar), a cloud load testing and monitoring service. Previously he's held management and engineering roles at Jive Software, Gomez (acquired by Compuware) and Cisco Systems.\n\nPatrick is an avid open source contributor, most notably helping launch the Selenium browser automation project and Apache Struts 2.0. He's also published two books on open source development. Patrick holds a BS in Computer Science from University of California, San Diego.\n\nWatch more from the 2014 Velocity Conference: http://goo.gl/JoMfvo\nFind out more about Velocity: http://velocityconf.com/\n\nDon't miss an upload!
