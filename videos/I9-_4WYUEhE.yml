description: "Thanks to our Community Sponsors: Honeycomb.io and CircleCI.com\n\nSpeakers: Kevin Goldsmith (CTO, Onfido), Lawrence Bruhmuller (CTO, Optimizely), Neha Batra (Senior Engineering Manager, GitHub), Maria Gutierrez (Senior Director of Engineering, Intercom)\n\nUntil a certain point in your career you’re likely to be told the strategy for your company. If you need guidance, you’re able to look up to the people above you.\n\nBut as you become more senior, you become the person that people start looking up to - and you’re not only expected to set the direction of strategy, but you also have power to influence culture and create purpose for your teams.\n\nIn this panel, we’ll discuss how to create a vision for your teams. We’ll think about the things that you’ll need to consider in order to set a vision, how to ensure that everyone is included in its outcomes, and how to convey the message to your teams and the wider company."
