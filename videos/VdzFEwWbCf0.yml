description: "droidcon Italy webinar\n20 October 2020\nRoberto Orgiu, Android Engineer, The New York Times\n\nTrip into the async world\n\nRxJava has been around for a while, and Coroutines just surfaced the Android world. Different approaches to solve similar issues, but their learning curve is pretty different! What if we could actually make them work together, and bridge features meant for one to work on the other? And what about migrations? This and much more will be included in our trip through the async world on Android. And I promise, no AsyncTask have been harmed while making this talk!\n\nhttps://it.droidcon.com/2020/\nhttps://twitter.com/Droidconit\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/showcase/dro...\nhttps://www.instagram.com/droidconit/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/droidconIt"
