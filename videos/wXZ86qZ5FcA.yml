recordingDate: 1513268856
description: "Ford has embraced Cloud Foundry and Cloud Native development as we strive to deliver value for our customers at “Market Speed”. In order to achieve this we need to provide technical leadership to our development community that has competency with Java/JEE but is new to Cloud Foundry and the Spring/Spring Cloud ecosystem. In this session, we will discuss our reference application and its role in describing a default set of patterns and practices for our teams. We will also cover how we collaborated with Pivotal on its creation, and how our use of Agile, Continuous Integration, and Continuous Delivery in building this product serve as practical examples to our teams as they work to deliver cloud native applications at Ford.\n\n\nSlides: TBA\n \nTodd Hall, Application Architect, Ford Motor Company\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2017"
