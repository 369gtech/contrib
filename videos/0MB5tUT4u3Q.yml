description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nCRI-O: Development Process & How to Contribute - Urvashi Mohnani & Peter Hunt, Red Hat \n\nAre you interested in contributing to Cloud Native projects, or open source, but are unsure on where to start? The CRI-O community strives to be welcoming and accessible for new contributors, and would love your help! Urvashi Mohnani and Peter Hunt will dive into the basic workflow behind open source development, using CRI-O as an example. They will walk attendees through the entire process of contribution, including: finding a bug or feature to work on, submitting a PR, cooperating with the needs of CI/CD systems, the approval process, and having their work integrated downstream. After seeing this talk, budding community members should be ready to submit their first contribution to CRI-O.\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zewa"
