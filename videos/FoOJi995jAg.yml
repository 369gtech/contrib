title: 'Uwe L  Korn- Pandas to Sql is Simple but Not Fast| PyData Global 2020'
language: English
recordingDate: 1609866572
description: "Talk \nPandas provides convenience methods to read and write to databases using to_sql and read_sql. They provide great usability and a uniform interface for all databases that support an SQL Alchemy connection. Sadly, the layer of convenience also introduces a performance loss. Luckily, for a lot of databases, a performant access layer is available.\n\nSpeaker\nUwe Korn is a Software / Data Engineer at QuantCo. His expertise is on building scalable architectures for machine learning services and the teams around that. Nowadays he focuses on the data engineering infrastructure that is needed to provide the building blocks to bring machine learning models into production. As part of his work to provide an efficient data interchange he became a core committer to the Apache Parquet and Apache Arrow projects. In addition to building software, he is also taking care of packaging software and recently became part of the core team of the conda-forge distribution.\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
