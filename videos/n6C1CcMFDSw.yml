description: "If you are a web developer, you already have most of the necessary knowledge to get started in physical computing. This talk will show you how easy it is to leverage your HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills to interact with the real, physical world. It will look at the best (free) software and (easy to use) hardware to make this happen.\n\nThe strategy goes like this: 1) set up a browser-driven runtime environment, 2) hook up an I/O board to bridge the gap with the tangible world, 3) connect all sorts of cool widgets and 4) go crazy!\n\nJean-Philippe Côté\nLecturer & Creative Technologist, TangibleJS\nhttps://twitter.com/jpcote\nhttps://twitter.com/tangiblejs\nhttps://www.facebook.com/physcomp4webdevs\nhttps://www.behance.net/jpcote\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
