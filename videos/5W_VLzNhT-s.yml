description: "Beauty in Code 2018 was a single-track full day IT-conference held at the Malmö Live conference center on March 3, 2018, featuring seven different speakers from three continents.\nJames Bach about his session \"Beauty or Bugs: Using the Blink Oracle in Testing\": Here's how the blink technique works: 1. Blast a firehose of data at your senses. 2. Notice things in it that are ugly, weird, or that in any other way seem worthy of investigation. (This process takes time. Give yourself at least 20 milliseconds to make a judgment.) In this presentation I will show some examples of blinking and how I use tools to create visualizations that support the process. The art of blinking is in designing the right kinds of complex displays that make interesting problems stand out."
