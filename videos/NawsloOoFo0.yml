title: 'Data Streaming for Microservices using Debezium (Gunnar Morling)'

description: "Debezium (noun | de·be·zi·um | /d?:?b?:zi??m/) - Secret Sauce for Change Data Capture\n\nStreaming changes from your datastore enables you to solve multiple challenges: synchronizing data between microservices, maintaining different read models in a CQRS-style architecture, updating caches and full-text indexes, and feeding operational data to your analytics tools.\n\nJoin this session to learn what change data capture (CDC) is about and how it can be implemented using Debezium, an open-source CDC solution based on Apache Kafka. Find out how Debezium captures all the changes from datastores such as MySQL, PostgreSQL and MongoDB, how to react to the change events in near real-time, and how Debezium is designed to not compromise on data correctness and completeness also if things go wrong.\n\nIn a live demo we'll show how to set up a change data stream out of your application's database, without any code changes needed. You'll see how to sink the change events into other databases and how to push data changes to your clients using WebSockets.\n\nVoxxed Days Microservices 2018: 2 days conference (+1 optional workshops day) only on Microservices. \n\nFollow us on :\nWebsite : https://voxxeddays.com/microservices (bit.ly/vxdmicro)\nTwitter : https://twitter.com/vxdmicroservice\nLinkedin : https://www.linkedin.com/in/voxxed-days-microservices-906115164\nKeep in touch : https://t.co/pxf7cHZOpl\n\n#developers #conference #microservices"
