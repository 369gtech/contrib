description: "GoWayFest 3.0, Minsk â€“ July 5, 2019\nGeneral Partner - SoftSwiss (https://www.softswiss.com/)\nVideo Partner - SEMrush (https://www.semrush.com/company/)\n\nDevOps ðŸ’™ Go, Simon Aronsson \n\nMuch of the tooling used for infrastructure automation still consists of page after page of shell scripts. Our operations tools deserve the same level of care, quality and portability as the software we deliver! \nWhat if, instead of building our ops tooling as scripts, we were to build them as services? With great golang features like cross-platform (and architecture) compilation, static linking, docker client api's and more - nothing is holding us back. \nDuring 30 minutes, Simon was mixing code examples and theory in an attempt to discover why golang is so awesome for doing devops work."
