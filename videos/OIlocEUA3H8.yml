description: "Code Mesh London is the best place in Europe for non-mainstream tech and programming languages. On 4-5 December 2013 over 50 inventors and originators of the most innovative languages and technologies of the moment shared their experience with 200 attendees. Topics included Scala, Haskell, Clojure, Erlang, Elixir, Julia and much more. See you at Code Mesh 2014! codemesh.io/\n\nAbout the talk:\nJan will show how to use RabbitMQ to connect components on different platforms. After a few introductory slides explaining the main concepts, the rest of the talk will be live code. The coding will begin by showing simple Scala / Akka code to connect to RabbitMQ to send and receive messages--think \"java.lang.String\" values back and forth to start with. We will then increase the complexity of the messages and marshal the messages into JSON. Jan will then show the real power of messaging infrastructures by replacing the RPC server component by native code in C++: we will write image processing component. To make matters even better--faster--we will then use CUDA to perform the image processing.\nCome to Jan's talk and demo if you want to find out how to use Scala, Akka and RabbitMQ in the core of your application, especially if your application needs to tie together code on completely different platforms and if it performs heavy number crunching or image processing. You do not need to have deep knowledge of Scala, Akka, RabbitMQ, Boost, OpenCV, ...; all that you will need is your _inner geek_."
