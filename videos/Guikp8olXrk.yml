description: "Fitting into tight footprint restrictions is one of the biggest challenges for the Java platform in the new market of small embedded devices. Fortunately, executing arbitrary applications on such small devices is rarely necessary. Usually there is a specific use case for a device and a specific application to execute. How can we do our best to optimize a single program for such a situation? Take advantage of a closed-world model and automatically strip out all system and application classes, code, and data that are not used by the application. This session discusses optimization techniques that can be applied in a new deployment model, their benefits, and consequences for application developers.\n\n\nAuthor:\nArtur Pilipenko\nSoftware engineer at Sun Microsystems/Oracle since 2009\nView more trainings by Artur Pilipenko at https://www.parleys.com/author/artur-pilipenko-1\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
