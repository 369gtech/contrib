description: "A rational guide to security based on what I have seen, what I do myself and practices I wish I did but might have to do now because I wrote a talk about it. Every day we see data breaches, every day we see people losing money, private data and other valuable things. How can we stop it, what can you do in your everyday computing that will help you with your security posture.\n\nThis talk attempts to show you in rational steps, beginning with the easy all the way up to things like separate machines for different tasks levels of security.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks, courses, and conferences in the following links:\nhttps://ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-security.com/"
