description: "My new HTML5 & CSS3 COURSE IS OUT NOW!\nhttps://developedbyed.com/\n\nI am excited to bring you a javascript tutorial today. I always enjoyed apples product presentation pages on their website.\nOne cool thing they did was they animated a sequence of pictures or video based on the users scroll.\nSo in this episode we are going to create a javascript animation that animates a video based on scroll just like the one on airpod pro.\n\nAll the code will be available on patreon.\nFILES: https://www.patreon.com/posts/31251043\n\nüéÅSupport me on Patreon for exclusive episodes, discord and more!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/dev_ed\n\nüõ¥ Follow me on:\nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/developedbyed\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/developedbyed\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/developedbyed/\nGithub: https://github.com/developedbyed/\n\n#javascript #programming"
