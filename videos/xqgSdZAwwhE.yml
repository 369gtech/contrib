description: 'Supercomputer-worthy core counts and memory sizes are more approachable than ever. "What can it do" is the obvious question to ask. Simulation, especially based around agents, is one of the possible answers. I will talk about agent based modelling, from the point of view of a developer building the framework, focusing on some interesting, non-trivial or plain old surprising experiences I''m getting building a JVM-based agent-based modelling SDK at Simudyne. We will talk performance, distributed systems, multithreading and SDK design.'
