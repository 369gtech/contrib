description: "RubyConf 2018 - Unraveling the Masculinization of Technology by Audrey Eschright\n\nHave you ever wondered where the perception that technology is a masculine pursuit comes from? Or why we have to explain that, \"no really, women are interested in computers too\"? At the beginning of the modern technological era, to be a computer was to be an actual literal woman—someone trained in math and computations. Decades later, women are underrepresented in most technical pursuits, with an increasingly “leaky” pipeline leaving fewer and fewer throughout our career progression. Learn about the gendered history of computing and explore how we can write a new narrative of participation."
