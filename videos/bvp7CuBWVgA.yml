description: "Google I/O 2010 - Appstats - RPC instrumentation and optimizations for App Engine \r\n\r\nApp Engine 201 \r\n\r\nGuido van Rossum \r\n\r\nAppstats is a pure userland library (for Python and Java) that inserts instrumentation hooks into the App Engine runtime at the interface between the runtime and services like the datastore. The collected statistics can be browsed in a rich UI which allows drilling down to various levels of detail. The talk will also discuss common optimizations to address typical findings. \r\n\r\nFor all I/O 2010 sessions, please go to http://code.google.com/events/io/2010/sessions.html"
