description: "Link to slides\nhttps://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1g2CeiWtu82V2bz-U5GUVFcqAdFA7fqTcxFEdBuOlRHo/edit?usp=sharing\n\nPage Speed will be a ranking factor for Google search\nLearn how to get a perfect Page Speed score\nHTTP 2 & CDN's are not the complete answer\n\nGoogle recently announced that starting in July 2018, page speed will be a ranking factor for mobile searches. Find out how that will affect you, and what you can do about it. Learn how to benchmark your siteâ€™s frontend and what metrics really matter. What pages should be heavily optimized, and what ones don't need to be. Learn why HTTP 2 isn't going to solve all your problems, and why inline css & defer js fixes the \"render-blocking in above-the-fold content\" issue.\n\nBy the end of the presentation you'll know what diagnostic tools to use, and how to solve the issues they find. If you apply all the tips listed in this presentation, on average your site's start render time will be cut in half, and the document ready metric will be improved by at least a quarter as well; with a high probability of hitting that perfect 100/100 score. These tips can apply to your Drupal 8 or 7 site or any site in general.\n\nBy not following this guide, users with a slow connection (mobile, cafe wifi, etc) may get bored and exit before your site even loads, and your search rankings will drop. Google AMP is not be the best way forward, as it has some drawbacks, also some of the AMP alternatives will still rank poorly in Google's tools.\_\n\nFight for the user! Prevent endless white screen loading pages! Come to this presentation to be the hero of frontend performance, the internet is counting on you!\_Also see a brief overview of some more advanced tools if you want to go above and beyond this presentation.\n\nPeople attending this session should know:\n\nHow to edit CSS and JS files\nInstall and configure themes and modules\nHave a Basic/Conceptual understanding of HTTP requests\nView the network panel/tab in the browser's console/developers tools\nNote that the experience level is set to Advanced because this presentation covers technical details\_that most webmasters don't think about, but the concepts are fairly easy to understand with actionable steps to take for just about every issue."
