description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\neBay Search On K8s - Mohnish Kodnani & Yashwanth Vempati, eBay \n\neBay currently has billions of items available for search. The search engine at any given time can get around 100Kâ€™s of queries per second for search within this inventory.   In order to support this scale of traffic and the size of the inventory we need thousands of servers. The inventory is sharded and then replicated across these servers to handle the traffic. In this talk we will go through how we migrated the application to kubernetes and its deployment architecture while meeting some of the business requirements for resiliency and availability. We will also go through our index distribution architecture that leverages kubernetes principles. At the end we will also share our challenges and learnings while deploying the application on kubernetes. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UaXv"
