If you answered yes to any of the above, or simply want to find out more about making music with code, then come along and join in.\n\nIn this session we will explore how to combine musical theory with programming skills to craft interesting and inspiring musical compositions in real time. Everything you need to take your first steps as a live coder will be covered, and you'll leave with the understanding you require to have real control over the music you create.\n\nHaving spent many years in process design, developing drugs for pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline, Dr. Jonathan Graham decided to take a twist in his career by letting another passion take the drivers seat.
