description: "React just exploded in popularity. But it’s only a UI library, not a full-fledged framework like Angular, Ember or [insert latest JS framework]. We need to create our own “framework” by picking from the plethora of libraries in the React ecosystem. But which ones should we choose? Or better yet, which ones do we actually need? Do we need a Flux implementation? What about handling ES6+, bundling and routing? How does it all come together?!1?!\n\nLet’s walk through the tools and helper libraries that surround React. You’ll get the most out of the session with familiarity with React and its concepts, but you don’t need to be an expert. By the end of the session, you’ll have a solid understanding of the ecosystem, know which libraries you should prioritize learning first, and confidently build your own React-based stack.\n\nBen Ilegbodu is a Christian, a husband and a father with over 10 years of experience developing for the Web. He currently is the manager of Eventbrite’s Frontend Platform team. On the side, Ben also enjoys playing basketball, watching movies, and blogging (benmvp.com) / tweeting (@benmvp) about his experiences with new web development technologies."
