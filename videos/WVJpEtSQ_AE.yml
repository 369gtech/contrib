language: English
recordingDate: 1585812285
description: "During the session, we will dissect all symptoms of “fintech is the new black” phenomenon – the growth of fintech startups and the rise of challenger banks, the digitalization of banks and banks opening themselves to work with startups. We’ll track how fintech went a long way, from being just a glitch in a mailbox to major business with $39B investment last year and a total of 39 unicorns (and still growing). We will also show you what fintech means to banks – what startups apply to banks to work with them and what is the \"fintech secret sauce\" of winning such cooperation.\n\nThe speech took place on 8th May 2019 on Growth Stage during Infoshare 2019.\n\n#infoshare #fintech #pkobankpolski"
