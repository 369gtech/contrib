title: 'GTAC 2014: Make Chrome the best mobile browser'
language: English
recordingDate: 1416019625
description: "Karin Lundberg (Google)\n\nOne of the reasons for Chrome’s success has been its core principles of speed, stability, simplicity and security (the 4 S’s). When we released Chrome for Android and iOS, we not only applied the 4 S’s to the browser itself but also to how we do automated testing and the kind of tests we run:\n\nSpeed is for performance testing and fast tests.\nStability is for stability testing and stable tests.\nSimplicity is for testing that Chrome has a simple user experience and for making it simple to add and run tests.\nSecurity is for security testing."
