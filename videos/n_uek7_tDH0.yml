title: 'Enabling autonomy at Spotify (Joakim Sundén, 2018)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1636122311
description: "Spotify's way of working with agile at scale, aka \"the Spotify Model\", has spread like wildfire through the software industry and every other organisation now wants to leverage the power of \"autonomous squads\". But autonomy, especially aligned and effective autonomy, is an outcome, not something you start with. \n\nSo how can organisations and leaders help grow autonomous squads? In this talk Joakim Sundén will share from his experience at Spotify struggling with exactly this challenge."
