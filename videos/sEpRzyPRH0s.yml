recordingDate: 1478722626
description: "In this session, I'm going to show you how to visualize data using the popular data visualization library (D3.js). This is useful for showing your results from machine learning algorithms, or just for you to understand what your data looks like. We visualize survivor stats from the popular Kaggle Titanic Survivor dataset.\n\nThe code in this video can be found here:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/D3_Data_visualization_live\n\nPlease support me on Patreon!
