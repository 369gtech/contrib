description: "Jim Grisanzio talks with Sai Penumuru about the Oracle Groundbreakers India Yatra 2020 that took place over three weeks in July. The virtual event was massive with over 100 speakers from two dozen countries. Participants engaged in technologies and labs ranging from Java to Cloud to Database to Applications. Sai also spoke in detail about all the lessons learned from running the epic event. If you want to know what it takes to produce a first class virtual conference in 2020 Sai and the volunteers at All India Oracle Users Group (AIOUG) have a lot to share. #ogyatra #aioug #oracle\n\nhttps://twitter.com/sai_penumuru\nhttps://twitter.com/jimgris\nhttps://www.aioug.org/ogyatra\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/AIOUG\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPIzp-E1msraCFAAY7aEVdRrhgCleboiN"
