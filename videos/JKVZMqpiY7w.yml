description: "The Web today is an incredibly powerful platform, but there's still a gap between what web apps can do and the capabilities of native apps. Progressive Web Apps get us part of the way there, but to truly compete, the Web needs access to more powerful APIs, too. Well, good news! They're coming! From contact pickers to file system access to app badging and more, new APIs are on their way to expand what kinds of applications can be built on the Web. \n\nThis talk covers some of these new and upcoming APIs and how you can start using them today. \n\nPresented by: Sam Richard \n\nView the schedule → https://goo.gle/2nON8mp\n\n#ChromeDevSummit All Sessions → https://goo.gle/CDS19\n\nSubscribe to Google Chrome Developers → https://goo.gle/ChromeDevs\n\nEvent photos → \_https://goo.gle/CDS19Photos"
