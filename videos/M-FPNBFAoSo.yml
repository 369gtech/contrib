title: 'Project Panamaâ€™s Foreign API'
language: English
recordingDate: 1540500653
description: "Maurizio Cimadamore, Oracle\n\nProject Panama is about getting the Java runtime closer to the hardware system (or metal) so it can perform more efficiently and developers can be more productive. A key component of Project Panama is the Foreign API, a foreign function interface that aims to provide a superior alternative to JNI. Developers can bind Java interfaces to native methods and write platform-specific Java code to those interfaces with no need for Java native methods and writing platform-specific code in C or C++. This session explains the Panama Foreign API and presents examples. Developers will come away with a good understanding of the API and will have the knowledge to experiment with early-access builds."
