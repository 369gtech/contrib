title: 'Microservices love Domain-Driven Design, why and how?'
recordingDate: 1543661698
description: 'With the emergence of Microservices, Domain-Driven Design has become a relevent way for looking at implementing business contexts in software. This talk explains how the patterns and concepts of Domain-Driven Design relate to Microservice architectures. We will see that Microservices are not only about Bounded Contexts and that there is much more to DDD than Entities and Aggregates. In addition to that I will show how Domain Driven Design will help you to structure and model your Microservices in terms of granularity, business context and interface design (just to name a few). Finally, we will look into migrating existing monolithic applications with the help of patterns laid out in DDD. This is not a very Groovy / Grails specific talk but I think it is some very important stuff to consider when designing Microservices implemented with Groovy or Grails. I will address various Grails technologies such as the event system or an integration to Spring Cloud Stream throughout the talk.'
