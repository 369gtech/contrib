As our software gets larger and does more, that complexity resurfaces in new and less obvious ways. As much as the actor model is lauded for being like an organism, organic code can become full of structural complexity.\n\nIs there a way to strengthen our code, while retaining its flexibility and making it even clearer to communicate our intent? There is! The decades since, we've developed new techniques and patterns to structure our code. And best of all, we can have them encoded in libraries and modules directly! These techniques are starting to become enshrined in standard libraries of other languages — can they be brought to Elixir?\n\nSlides & full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/brooklyn-zelenka/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - BROOKLYN ZELENKA\nPrograms with functions λ \n\nMore on Brooklyn Zelenka: https://codesync.global/speaker/brooklyn-zelenka/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CBL AMSTERDAM 19\nCBL AMSTERDAM is powered by Code Sync.
