description: "The math behind cryptography is immensely fascinating, I could spend all day studying it! We're going to go over some fundamental cryptographic concepts like hashing, zero knowledge proofs, and my favorite 'ZK-Snarks'. This is quite an in-depth video, i had to pick and choose the topics i wanted to dive into more. There is so, so much i could talk about. Each of these topics could deserve their own course. Cryptography is going to be paramount to building future decentralized Artificial Intelligence systems that we can both control and protect from attackers.\n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/crypto_math/blob/master/Crypto%20Math.ipynb\n\nPlease Subscribe!
