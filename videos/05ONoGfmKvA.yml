It has been packed up with a lot of real-life examples, where you can apply the learnt content to use. Features such as Semantic Analysis, Text Processing, Sentiment Analytics and Machine Learning have been discussed.\n\nThis course is for anyone who works with data and text– with good analytical background and little exposure to Python Programming Language. It is designed to help you understand the important concepts and techniques used in Natural Language Processing using Python Programming Language.  You will be able to build your own machine learning model for text classification. Towards the end of the course, we will be discussing various practical use cases of NLP in python programming language to enhance your learning experience.\n\n--------------------------\n\nWho Should go for this course ?\n\nEdureka’s NLP Training is a good fit for the below professionals:\nFrom a college student having exposure to programming to a technical architect/lead in an organisation\nDevelopers aspiring to be a ‘Data Scientist'\nAnalytics Managers who are leading a team of analysts\nBusiness Analysts who want to understand Text Mining Techniques\n'Python' professionals who want to design automatic predictive models on text data \n\"This is apt for everyone”\n\n---------------------------------\n\n\nWhy Learn Natural Language Processing  or NLP?\n\nNatural Language Processing (or Text Analytics/Text Mining) applies analytic tools to learn from collections of text data, like social media, books, newspapers, emails, etc. The goal can be considered to be similar to humans learning by reading such material. However, using automated algorithms we can learn from massive amounts of text, very much more than a human can. It is bringing a new revolution by giving rise to chatbots and virtual assistants to help one system address queries of millions of users.\n\nNLP is a branch of artificial intelligence that has many important implications on the ways that computers and humans interact. Human language, developed over thousands and thousands of years, has become a nuanced form of communication that carries a wealth of information that often transcends the words alone. NLP will become an important technology in bridging the gap between human communication and digital data.\n\n---------------------------------\n\nFor Natural Language Processing Training call us at US: +18336900808 (Toll Free) or India: +918861301699 , Or, write back to us at sales@edureka.co"
