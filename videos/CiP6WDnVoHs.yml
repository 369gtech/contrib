description: "Preventing Doomsday: x509 Certificates in Cloud Foundry - Tom Mitchell & David Dobmeier, Stark & Wayne\n\nThis talk covers the use and rotation of TLS certificates in distributed systems to enhance security and the ongoing monitoring of certificate expiry required to ensure uptime. We take a look at Cloud Foundry as a case study on the use of mutual TLS between networked components, where the number of required certificates can grow large and non-trivial to manage. We share some of our own stories with Cloud Foundry and BOSH certificates expiring, the effect this can have on the system as a whole, and methods weâ€™ve used to avoid the downtime this causes.\n\nAbout David Dobmeier\nDavid Dobmeier is a Cloud Engineer at Stark & Wayne. He has seven years of experience including Systems/Network Administration to DevOps, Software Development, and Cloud Infrastructure. In the past few years, he has focused on large-scale infrastructure and software systems including deploying CloudFoundry, building and maintaining BOSH releases, and working on open source tools to streamline deployment and maintenance of such systems. He has also worked with both the PCF and Open Source communities on installation, training, and operating their new systems.\n\nAbout Tom Mitchell\nTom Mitchell is a Cloud Engineer at Stark & Wayne. He spends his days consulting on Cloud Foundry and BOSH, and creating tools to make life easier for other people working in the domain. He types in Dvorak and makes sure to tell everybody.\n\nhttps://www.cloudfoundry.org/"
