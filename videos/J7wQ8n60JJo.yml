title: 'Doug Sillars Using AI to Power Your Images at Mobile Era'
recordingDate: 1574413891
description: "Optimizing image content for every browser and device size can be difficult. Random cropping of images can lead to losing context and features (sometimes as extreme as lopping off the heads of your subjects). In this talk it will be presented how AI can be used to identify the important content in each image, allowing for smart cropping of images. This allows to optimize images further than perviously possible, shrinking page size, and speeding up page load times.\n\nAbout the speaker\nDoug is is a freelance mobile performance expert, having helped thousands of developers speed up their mobile apps and websites. A Google Developer Expert and the author of O’Reilly’s “High Performance Android Apps,” Doug regularly speaks at conferences, and blogs at dougsillars.com.
