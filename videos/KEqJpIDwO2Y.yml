title: 'Speech recognition and retrieval using unsupervised sub-word language models'
recordingDate: 1202553464
description: "Google Tech Talks\nFebruary,  8 2008\n\nABSTRACT\n\nUnsupervised morpheme analysis and language models developed at\nHelsinki University of Technology (TKK) open interesting new views on\nlarge vocabulary speech recognition, information retrieval and machine\ntranslation.\nThis approach learns suitable sub-word units directly from relevant\ntext corpora in a completely data-driven manner and can, thus, be\neasily ported to various morphologically complex languages.\nOur system includes several public domain software packages: Morfessor\nfor determining the modeling units, VariKN to train effectively\nsmoothed long-span LMs, a near-realtime single-pass decoder for LMs\nand LVCSR, and demos at: \nhttp://www.cis.hut.fi/projects/morpho/\nhttp://www.cis.hut.fi/projects/speech/\n\nI will also summarize the results from the recent Morpho Challenge\nmachine learning competitions in morpheme analysis for language\nmodeling and information retrieval:\nhttp://www.cis.hut.fi/morphochallenge2007/\n\n\n\nSpeaker: Mikko Kurimo\nMikko Kurimo is currently Academy Research Fellow at Helsinki\nUniversity of Technology (TKK), where he was an acting professor of\nComputer and Information Science (2001-2003). In 1998-2000 he worked as a postdoc at IDIAP and his Doctor of Science (PhD) degree is from TKK 1997. He has a long research record and a number of publications in large\nvocabulary speech recognition (since 1990) and has been involved in several\ninternational and national research projects and is TKK's site manager\nin the FP6 Network of Excellence PASCAL.\nAt TKK's Adaptive Informatics Research Centre (which is one of the Centres\nof\nExcellence nominated by the Academy of Finland) he leads the Speech\nRecognition and Multimodal Interfaces research groups.\nThe current research focus of his speech group is in language independent\nand unsupervised models for continuous speech with morpheme-based\nlanguage models for very large vocabulary.\nThe relevant pilot applications in the group range from unlimited\nvocabulary dictation systems for different languages to audio indexing\nand speech-to-speech translation.\nAt the moment Mikko Kurimo is an International Fellow at SRI until\nFebruary 2008."
