description: "Titel: From enterprise-ish to serverless — Insights and practices from our connected vehicle journey\n\nThe way of building applications and orchestrating them to larger distributed systems and service-oriented solutions has changed continuously. Several abstractions emerged to ease application development and the usage of infrastructure. Originally, the cloud and on-demand computing journey started with basic pay-per-use infrastructure services like virtual servers, storage and network. Today, more powerful and developer-friendly abstractions are available. Examples include managed execution environments (like PaaS, FaaS and container runtimes), storage and communication services (like managed databases, event brokers and API gateways), service meshes and machine learning platforms.\n\nThese abstractions hide most of the underlying infrastructure and servers, so building distributed systems becomes increasingly \"serverless\" and focuses on delivering business value. However, developing and operating serverless systems at scale requires pretty different approaches to succeed. This is especially challenging for organizations with a longer history of enterprise-ish infrastructure management and bureaucratic interactions between development, operations and other parties. Besides the required technical changes, structural and mindset transformations are often hard to get into the organization.\n\nThis talk discusses several aspects like moving from enterprise silos (development, test, security, compliance, operations, etc.) to holistic software ownership by empowered teams who truly practice continuous delivery. Another example for transitioning from enterprise-ish to serverless is moving from sophisticated and time-consuming staging to continuous deployment and testing in production.\n\nActionable takeaways from this talk:\n1) Lessons learned from our connected vehicle journey: moving from enterprise-ish development and operations to building cloud native microservices and (mostly) serverless systems\n2) When minor cosmetic organizational changes are not enough: essential transformations in mindset and structure to achieve technical excellence, speed, quality and fast feedback in a serverless world\n3) How to utilize continuous delivery as the business-critical driver to scale solutions and organizations both economically and technically\n\nMy CV and profile: http://jowettinger.de\n\nMy previous talks and publications: http://iaas.jowettinger.de\n\nSpeaker: Johannes Wettinger - Tech Lead & Architect, Bosch Connected Mobility\n\nJohannes was a researcher in computer science for a couple of years and finished his PhD at the Institute of Architecture of Application Systems (University of Stuttgart). Beside his teaching activities, his research focuses on continuous delivery and DevOps automation, mainly for microservices and cloud native applications. During this time, he published numerous papers and gave several talks at established research conferences [http://iaas.jowettinger.de]. Furthermore, he was involved in research projects with several European industry partners of different sizes. Beginning of 2017, he moved to industry and joined Robert Bosch GmbH as a technical lead to work on connected mobility solutions, mainly focusing on their backends. By practicing an \"elevator role\", he is actively involved in development, operations and higher-level architecture work. He advocates continuous delivery and technology innovation, helping teams to adopt modern engineering practices."
