title: 'ML Inference at scale, with Apache Beam and the Flink runner: Easy as learning your 5 times tables.'
recordingDate: 1635787801
description: 'In this talk, we will make use of Apache Beam and the Apache Flink runner along with the RunInference transform from the tfx-dsl library to build several inference pipelines, from single models to multiple models in chained or branched configurations. The talk is designed for developers and tata engineers of all levels who want to learn how to develop machine learning pipelines with Apache Beam and Apache Flink (+TensorfFlow).'
