description: "Slide Deck: http://bit.ly/autoscaling-slidedeck\n\nAuto-Scaling can help developers save money in their running databases by growing and shrinking the OCPUs based on the incoming workload, allowing a true pay-per-use consumption.  This session will review the constraints of Auto-Scaling, how to establish your Auto-Scaling base line allocations, how to monitor its actions over time and correlate to billing reports, when to consider augmenting with manual scaling activities."
