title: 'From Java bytecode to instant class diagrams with Class Visualizer by Jonatan Kazmierczak'

description: "Dealing with existing big Java codebase is typically not a pleasure. First of all we need to understand it - starting from the structure of classes and relations between them. But how to quickly understand a software composed from thousands or tens of thousands of classes? The best way is to visualize them on automatically generated, complete and readable class diagrams. It that a reasonable wish?\n\nClass Visualizer is created to fulfil exactly that wish. It is a free, instant class diagram generator from the Java bytecode prepared to handle correctly even huge codebases. It exists for 6 years and is downloaded over 1,500 times per month.\n\nDuring this session we will discover how Class Visualizer can support us during our daily development work. We will visualize a sample project based on Spring 5 and, as a second example, the Java standard library (over 16,384 classes). Based on these examples we will examine usability, reliability and performance of the tool. Of course, there will be also time for questions.\n\n# Jonatan Kazmierczak\nJonatan Kazmierczak - senior consultant at Trivadis Switzerland, creator of Class Visualizer, top rated participant in contests in programming and data science, working with Java for 20 years. He started programming at the age of 12 and until now he likes demos from 8-bit Atari XL/XE."
