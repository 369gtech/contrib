description: "Tuning Your Grails Applications\nBy Peter Ledbrook\nStaff Engineer, SpringSource, a division of VMware\n\nGrails is focused on developer productivity more than raw speed, but that doesn't mean it's a slouch. When you do need better response times, there are plenty of options available - as this talk will demonstrate. \n\nFind out both how to isolate performance issues and what you can do to fix them. This is a large and complex area, so the focus will be on Grails-specific solutions."
