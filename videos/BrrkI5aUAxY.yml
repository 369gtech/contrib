description: "This presentation will tell a story about the development of a push notifications system from scratch. The story is about the challenges that were faced, the limitations that were accepted, the decisions that were made, and the tools that were used along the journey.\n\nThe talk will also show how Elixir and Cassandra played key roles in making the system utterly performant and easily scalable without compromising robustness, of course."
