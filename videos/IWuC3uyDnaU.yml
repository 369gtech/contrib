title: 'Wrap or no-wrap: Wrappers for external libraries - Daryna Chernysheva (Russian)'
recordingDate: 1582114310
description: "We always use external dependencies in our tests. It can be done in many ways, like using their API directly, or hiding them behind custom wrappers, or writing helpers. There is no one and the only best solution.\n\nIn this talk, Daryna compares these approaches. She analyses their side effects, talks about preconditions for their usage, and performs some case studies in our favourite format \"What Could Possibly Go Wrong\"."
