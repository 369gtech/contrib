description: "In the last few decades, memory is becoming a key element in defining overall cost and system performance with respect to other semiconductor components. Up until now, memory demand has been satisfied by the standard optimization and miniaturization techniques currently implemented. However, there is a growing need for a new innovative approach that could resolve the pressing need for cost reduction and storage density increase. \n\nDuring this presentation a breakthrough into Non-volatile memories will be presented.\n\nPrezentacja miała miejsce 23.06.2020."
