recordingDate: 1575916031
description: "Presented at Abstractions II, a software conference Code & Supply in Pittsburgh, PA August 21-23, 2019. Learn more at http://www.codeandsupply.co or https://abstractions.io. \n\nThe RAW CUTS series is comprised of selections from a few of our stages wherein the raw video was of high enough quality for C&S to release it before post-production. \n\nPost-production for a community-run conference with as many speakers and as low of a budget as Abstractions is an enormous and time-consuming undertaking. If you're interested in volunteering your time and CPU cycles to help with post-production, we can use your help. Email us at support@codeandsupply.co and we'll get you into the mix. You'll be permitted to credit yourself in the video pre-roll and credits and we'll thank you in this text and on social media.\n\nInterested in sponsoring professional post-production costs in exchange for your company's name and logo in the video forevermore? Contact us at sponsorship@abstractions.io. Opportunities start at $1,000.\n\n-----\n\nPersonal data privacy is a hot-button item today. It can often seem overly burdensome for the software developer looking to change the world. Developers and designers may look at regulations and current trends in data privacy as negative impacts to product innovation.\n\nThis is the wrong lens by which we should look at this.\n\nIn this talk, Noble shares opportunities to innovate around the growth in data, the growth in regulations like the GDPR. He shares insights on human-centered design opportunities that can help both independent developers or an established corporation. He presents practical examples to minimize the data you collect and best practices on asking for data in software only when it provides value for the user.\n\nhttps://abstractions.io/schedule/#Positive%20Sum,%20Building%20with%20Privacy%20as%20a%20Basic%20Need-Noble%20Ackerson"
