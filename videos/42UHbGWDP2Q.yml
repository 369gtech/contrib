description: "by Megan Wilhite\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/UB2.252A/modified_agent_based_architecture.webm\n\n\nSalt initially was designed to be an agent-base automation system. Salt SSH was added later on to allow an alternative that does not require installing a agent, and instead communicate over SSH. We will discuss how we modified the initial agent-based solution and the architectural decisions behind this work. We will talk through some of the challenges, lessons learned and what worked well for the project. \n\nRoom: UB2.252A (Lameere)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 18:00:00+01"
