language: English
recordingDate: 1497859484
description: "Angular 2 was recently released in late 2016 and was significantly different from its predecessor, AngularJS. Angular 2 introduces Ahead-of-Time (AoT) and a new structure that is more decoupled. In this talk, I’ll talk about building a mobile website for the modern world; the progressive way. Simple app demonstration will also be done. We will also discuss about the pros and cons of building a progressive web app and the possible future of the web. If you don’t know Angular 2 but still know some things about JavaScript, you’re likely still be able to understand this talk.\n\nWoo Huiren (Ngee Ann Polytechnic)\nA young, aspiring and passionate opensource developer."
