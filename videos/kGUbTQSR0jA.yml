title: 'Tracing Issues in Your Application'
language: English
recordingDate: 1632327470
description: "Imagine that you are receiving a support ticket that your application is not working. You read the attached stack trace and now it's time to solve the mysteryâ€”what did the user do that led to triggering this exception? Is it possible to find all the logs from all the applications that correspond to this user's business operation?\n \n What if the user is complaining that the system is slow? How can you decide which concrete operation is the culprit? Is there any way to visualize the latency?\n \n Let's answer these questions by taking a deep dive into application observability using distributed tracing, metrics, and correlated logs via Spring Cloud Sleuth, Tanzu Observability, OpenZipkin, OpenTelemetry, and more!\n \n This presentation will consist of some theory, plus live coding and demos.\n\n Jonatan Ivanov, Senior Software Engineer at VMware\n Marcin Grzejszczak, Staff Engineer, Spring Cloud at VMware\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/tracing-issues-in-your-application"
