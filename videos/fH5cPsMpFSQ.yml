description: "We live in a competitive world. That competition forces change. It has always forced change. Change is normal.\n\nThe question is not whether our organizations will change, thatâ€™s a given, but can we see this change before it hits us or are we simply rudderless boats being battered by wave after wave? It certainly feels that way sometimes.\n\nTo answer the question we need to understand our landscape, the economic forces at play, the context we operate within and our situational awareness of this. Can we navigate the waters, can we see the storm coming or are we being battered because we refuse to look?\n\nDuring this talk we will examine the level of situational awareness within business, why it matters and whether we can anticipate and exploit change before it hits us.\n\nSpeaker: Simon Wardley, Researcher, Leading Edge Forum"
