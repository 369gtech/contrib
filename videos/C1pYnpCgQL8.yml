description: 'Incanter is no longer actively maintained, and there is a real lack of good tooling to do data science in Clojure. Most of the action in Data Science happens in R and python, with the occasional big player in java. Iâ€™ll be talking about our work to bring the Clojure data science ecosystem back to life through open source libraries.'
