description: "Keynote: 5 Years of etcd: Past, Present, and Future - Brandon Philips, CTO CoreOS, Red Hat & Xiang Li, Senior Staff Software Engineer, Alibaba \n\nIn July 2013 the etcd project was announced to solve a critical problem for CoreOS: how to safely coordinate unattended automatic software updates across a cluster of Linux nodes. Today hundreds of companies use etcd as part of their production systems to hold critical data for their Kubernetes clusters, network systems, monitoring systems, and much more. But, how did etcd evolve into a critical system in the Cloud Native ecosystem? This talk will cover the 5-year history of etcd from the stumbles, use cases, and technical evolution. We will also dive into the trade-offs that were made as the system went from theoretical prototype to a production ready workhorse. And touch on where the project is going as it moves into the CNCF. There is no expectation of prior knowledge of etcd or how it works. The ideal audience member has a love for distributed systems, and operations. \n\nTo Learn More: https://sched.co/Gsvf"
