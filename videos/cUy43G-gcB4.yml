description: 'Pokemon filled many of our childhoods, and some of our adulthoods, with joy. In this live coding adventure, we will recapture the magic of playing Pokemon together with the help of a Twilio phone number built with server-side JavaScript interacting with Gameboy emulator scripts. By the end of this session, you will learn how to write video game emulator scripts and interact with them using Node.js and Express.'
