description: "Simon Cozens\nhttp://linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/79/\nWhat really happens when you type characters into a word processor, typesetter or desktop publishing system, and press print? For the past few years I've been writing software which lays out characters into documents. It's had to deal with OpenType fonts, Unicode texts and PDF documents, and each of these have turned out to be really cool pieces of technology. We'll be breaking apart fonts to see what's inside, opening up PDF files in a text editor, and following the path of a word as it makes its way from your keyboard to the printed page."
