description: "Within the last few years, gesture cameras started their triumphal march through the world of video gaming. A lot of new devices and games are showing the possibilities of this new way to control games in a spectacular way. This session is about different camera technologies, their binding to Java, and the advantages and disadvantages of the underlying technology. Via visualizers, the presentation introduces the Leap Motion, Intel RealSense, and Kinect v2. It includes many demo showcases, such as controlling a Parrot AR.Drone with bare hands and different metaphors. Other demos such as games present different applications for this new way to control computers and other systems.\n\n\nAuthors:\nMartin Förtsch\nMartin Förtsch is a software consultant from Munich in Germany and studied computer sciences at the University of Applied Sciences in Merseburg.\n\nBeside his work as a consultant he is strongly involved in the development of gesture control applications for different 3D camera systems. Among other things he controls the Parrot AR.Drone with bare hands and is involved in open source projects for this area.\n\nHis focus areas are Java, search engine technologies and databases.\nView more trainings by Martin Förtsch at https://www.parleys.com/author/martin-förtsch-1\n\n Thomas Endres\nThomas Endres studied information technology at the Technical University in Munich.\n\nHe is passionate about software development and all the other aspects of technology. In his spare time, he is working on gesture control applications, i.e. for controlling drones with bare hands. But he is also involved in other open source projects written in Java, C# and all kinds of JavaScript languages.\n\nFor a living, Thomas is working as a software consultant and as a lecturer at the University of Applied Sciences in Landshut.\nView more trainings by  Thomas Endres at https://www.parleys.com/author/thomas-endres\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
