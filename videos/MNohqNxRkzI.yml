title: 'The State of Counterclockwise: Past, Present and Future - Laurent Petit'
recordingDate: 1355703262
description: 'In this talk, I will present Counterclockwise aka ccw, a set of Eclipse plugins aimed at easing the development of Clojure projects. First, I will give an overview of the features, focusing on some with an interactive demo. Next, I will take my hands off of the keyboard to explain my goals as the core committer of ccw, starting with a brief explanation of why I chose to get on board, and a tentative projection of where it could be in the near and middle future.'
