recordingDate: 1497037268
description: "Justin Dossey, Chief Solutions Architect at New Context - ChefConf 2017\n\nMonitoring systems generate a wide variety of data relating to the health and state of services and data all over the network. This data is often useful to resources and recipes, but the check results themselves may reside on a separate server. Chefs are then forced to reimplement the checks themselves, leading to duplication of effort and the opportunity for confusion (when the reimplementation results do not match the original in all cases). In this talk, we will explore ways to make monitoring results easily available to Chef, leading to simpler code, better visibility, and faster, more reliable development."
