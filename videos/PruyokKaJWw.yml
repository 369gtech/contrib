description: "Demystifying SAML Using Spring Security\n\nCore Framework\n\nIdentity experts and veterans Sree Tummidi and Filip Hanik are back with another demystification session on federated identity management. SAML, still the most prominent standard among enterprise identity federation, is still not well understood and the specifications leave much to be desired for the reader and developers. Following this session you will have a clear understanding of SAML, the terminology used in the specifications and how interoperability is achieved using standard HTTP protocol messages.\nWait, we’re not done!\nSpring Security/SAML has gone through a face lift and Spring Security/SAML project has become a module in Spring Security. With the focus on the developer, this version of the framework has prioritized test driven development and extensibility while completely hiding the complexity of the underlying library and XML structures. Come and experience the source code behind it all. You will learn how to build a SAML service provider and an identity provider from scratch using the latest versions of Spring Security and Spring Boot.\n\nSpeakers\nFilip Hanik\nSenior Staff Engineer, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
