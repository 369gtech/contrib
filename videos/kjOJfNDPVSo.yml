description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nDesigning a gRPC Interface for Kernel Tracing with eBPF - Leonardo Di Donato, Sysdig \n\nAs a maintainer of the CNCF runtime security project, Falco, he was tasked with designing a mutually TLS authenticated API over gRPC in C/C++ to solve the runtime security problem. Join this talk to understand the challenges he faced with designing the interface, as well as the performance concerns with parsing millions of syscalls using eBPF over gRPC. The audience will walk away with an understanding of runtime security in cloud-native, as well as the technical concerns with building such an interface.\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zexb"
