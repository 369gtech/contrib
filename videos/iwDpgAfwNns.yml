description: "Traditional messaging middleware is clean - data and producer/consumer agnostic. Data Distribution is dirty - it exploits unlawful carnal knowledge of data structures and client environments and constraints to deliver high value real time conversational services.\n\nUnleashing the corporate firehose over the web and to mobile, or accepting small data anywhere from any device requires something a little bit different. It's messaging, sort of, but we're not in Kansas any more and there are no red shoes.\" \n\n\n\nLiked the song? It's \"Tank\" by Seatbelts"
