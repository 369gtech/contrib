recordingDate: 1514211710
description: "Let's talk while we code - in this live demonstration, Nir shows how easy it is to spin up a production grade web-handler in under 5 minutes. He also shows how the Clojure mentality of \"libraries as functions\" let's us easily expand our project's functionality. Through this live demonstration, he emphasizes some core ideas of the language and see them implemented in real life.\n\nNir Rubinstein is the Chief Architect of AppsFlyer - the company that runs the highest amount of Clojure code in production in Israel and handles 30B (and growing) daily incoming events. Nir has been writing Clojure for production in the last 5 years."
