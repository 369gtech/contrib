recordingDate: 1603820928
description: 'With over a quarter billion lines of code in Apache Flink, you may be asking yourself, ’how do I get involved in contributing to this?’. This will be an interactive session to get you from Flink user to contributor. We’ll provide a developer-focused head start, walking you through the codebase’s main modules and making a live change resulting in a new feature for the Flink community.'
