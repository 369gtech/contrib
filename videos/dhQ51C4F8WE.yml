description: "High Performance Networking with Kubevirt - Doug Smith, Red Hat & Abdul Halim, Intel \n\nWhen we’re talking about legacy workloads running in Kubernetes as Virtual Machines, we’re not talking about “any old workload” -- we’re usually talking about performance workloads. The KubeVirt community, Red Hat & Intel have come together to enable high performance networking for these workloads.  Need hardware-accelerated networking in a cloud-native environment? Using KubeVirt (for virtual machines on top of Kubernetes) and recent improvements in SR-IOV networking integration with Kubernetes, we'll talk about gaining performance networking for your apps, and for legacy workload migration. You’ll get the opportunity to explore the mechanics of running pods that are also connected to SR-IOV NICs. We’ll also look at how KubeVirt builds on top of and extends the base Kubernetes platform support for SR-IOV networking into the world of legacy virtual machines, all managed by kubectl. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPcw"
