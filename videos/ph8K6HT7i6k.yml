description: "Presented by Erin Swenson-Healey at JSLA (js.la) on Thursday January 30th 2014 - While the JavaScript event loop and asynchronous callbacks provide a powerful, easy-to-understand concurrency model - writing applications in continuation-passing style introduces problems of legibility, exception management, and composability.
