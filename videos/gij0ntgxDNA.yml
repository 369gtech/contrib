language: English
recordingDate: 1341942449
description: "Mayuresh Saoji, Danny Hermes\n\nTo get the best out of product search, merchants need to provide complete and accurate product information, as well as fresh price and availability data for all products. This session will provide merchants with concrete steps they can take to improve their data quality using the Content API for Shopping. We will provide details on when it makes sense to use the Content API to submit data (as opposed to Feeds), and how to use the API. We will also go into details on how to debug API requests and errors, and talk about general  best practices to follow in order to use the API optimally and efficiently. \n\nFor all I/O 2012 sessions, go to https://developers.google.com/io/"
