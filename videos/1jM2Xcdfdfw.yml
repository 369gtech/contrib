title: 'YOW! 2012 Bjorn Freeman-Benson - Some Considerations for Scaling: What We Did At New Relic'
language: English
recordingDate: 1513951404
description: "In four years, New Relic has grown from a dozen customers to over 25,000 customers, and from collecting hundreds of metrics a day to collecting billions a day. We’ve done this without a huge investment in hardware – which is very cool. This talk will cover some of the ways we built a system that has scaled so effectively. Sharding, of course, but sharding is not magic; caching, of course, but caching is not magic; hardware improvements, of course, but … well, you get the idea. There is no one magic solution but a combination a number of strategic decisions.\n\nBjorn Freeman-Benson joins New Relic as the Vice President of Engineering following an interesting career in software tools, most recently with the Eclipse Foundation supporting the leading open source Java IDE. Prior to that, he ran engineering for a reconfigurable hardware startup. Earlier in his career he held senior engineering positions at Amazon.com, Rational, and OTI. Bjorn holds a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Washington and spends his spare time orienteering, bicycling, or flying. Software Passion: Lots of people are in software, so what makes me special? I’m a software psychologist. As a software psychologist, I listen to the software team and help it get better.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
