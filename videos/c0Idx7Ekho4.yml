description: "Per-Ake Minborg\nCIO / CTO\nSpeedment\n\nWhenever you write code that mixes languages and domains, such as Java and SQL, you are going to get bugs. A solution is to move away from query languages such as SQL and instead write your business logic with the type-safe and object-oriented constructs we have learned to love in Java, such as streams, predicates, and functions. The Stream interface that came in Java 8 and was expanded in Java 9 will be introduced in this session, you will rediscover the power of the Stream interface in a completely new domain: relational databases. You will also learn how nicely it blends in with your existing application, even with no modifications on the database layer. This will not only increase your productivity but also help you build safer and more maintainable Java code."
