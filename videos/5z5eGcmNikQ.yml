description: "We’re so pleased to announce that we’ve teamed up with Dave Farley, author of “Continuous Delivery” and frequent GOTO Conferences speaker, for a monthly video series featuring ideas about continuous delivery, DevOps, test-driven development, BDD, software engineering and software development in general. \n\nFind plenty more from Dave on his Continuous Delivery YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCfqyGl3nq_V0bo64CjZh8g\n\nDave Farley - Continuous Delivery & DevOps Pioneer, Award-winning Author, Founder & Director of Continuous Delivery Ltd.\n\nABSTRACT\nWhat can you do to improve your code? Readable code, clean code is easier to work with and easier to change. So how do you get better at coding, what are some tips for coding beginners, and for more experienced developers, that will result in better code? What are the programming and coding tips that you can adopt to make it easier to create better software faster?\n\nBeing a software developer is not just about being able to write code that a computer can understand, it is about organising ideas so that you, and others, can understand it too. Writing software is challenging, software is abstract, almost infinitely flexible and extremely fragile. All this means that the quality of our choices, the design of our code matters. \n\nIn this episode, Dave Farley shows five common, really bad, examples that we see in code all the time and offers his advice on how to fix them, and how to improve your software, and your coding. Software engineering is about the continuous delivery of valuable software into the hands of our users: writing good quality code is an important part of that discipline.\n\nSome of the content in this episode was inspired by this blog post:\nhttps://blog.codinghorror.com/code-smells\n\nCD TRAINING COURSES\nIf you want to learn Continuous Delivery and DevOps skills, check out Dave Farley's courses\nhttps://bit.ly/DFTraining \n\nDAVE'S NEW BOOK\nYou can grab Dave Farley's new book 'Continuous Delivery Pipelines' here:\nhttps://leanpub.com/cd-pipelines\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#GOTOxDaveFarley #Programming #ImproveCode #TDD #Refactoring #DaveFarley #GOTO #GOTOcon #ContinuousDelivery\n\nDAVE'S LINKS\nhttps://www.continuous-delivery.co.uk\nhttps://twitter.com/davefarley77\nhttp://www.davefarley.net\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
