description: "SREcon16 Europe - Alerting for Distributed Systems—A Tale of Symptoms and Causes, Signals and Noise\n\nBjörn Rabenstein, SoundCloud\n\nNoisy alerts are the deadly sin of monitoring. They obfuscate real issues and cause pager fatigue. Instead of reacting with the due sense of urgency, the person on-call will start to skim or even ignore alerts, not to speak about the destruction of their sanity and work-life balance. Unfortunately, there are many monitoring pitfalls on the road to complex production systems, and most of them result in noisier alerts. In distributed systems, and in particular in a microservice architecture, there is usually a good understanding of local failure modes while the behavior of the system as a whole is difficult to reason with. Thus, it is tempting to alert on the many possible causes – after all, finding the root cause of a problem is important.\n\nView the full SREcon16 Europe Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon16europe/program"
