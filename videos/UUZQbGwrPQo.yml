title: 'Complex Integration with Oracle Coherence'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433784666
description: "Just because it’s in XML doesn’t mean that integration is simple. Take FpML, the language of today’s derivatives: it’s more than a dozen levels deep and contains many thousands of elements. Many older standards predate XML, creating months of work per message type. The software architecture consulting firm Incept5 needed to provide interchange between complex messages, event processing, and near-real-time APIs to hundreds of services distributed across a bank’s global systems. It combined some clever tooling, Oracle Coherence, a few new ideas, a dash of concurrency, and a lot of enterprise architecture to form a solution, one used today by many of world’s largest investment banks. This session walks through use cases from several banks— architecture, design, and code—and a little demo.\n\n\nAuthor:\nJohn Davies\nJohn Davies is a veteran speaker on global-scale enterprise architectures and high performance computing.
