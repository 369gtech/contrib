description: "In the light of rapidly changing market requirements organizations must accelerate to excel in the market. A 4-years research (by Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble and Gene Kim) has revealed that software delivery performance has a strong impact on profitability, productivity and market share of technology organizations. Loosely coupled architecture, such as promoted by microservices, and empowered teams are some of the capabilities to improve software delivery performance. After having already introduced microservices in a startup context I would like to share some thoughts what to do differently when introducing microservices next time in the future.\n\nVoxxed Days Microservices 2018: 2 days conference (+1 optional workshops day) only on Microservices. \n\nFollow us on :\nWebsite : https://voxxeddays.com/microservices (bit.ly/vxdmicro)\nTwitter : https://twitter.com/vxdmicroservice\nLinkedin : https://www.linkedin.com/in/voxxed-days-microservices-906115164\nKeep in touch : https://t.co/pxf7cHZOpl\n\n#developers #conference #microservices"
