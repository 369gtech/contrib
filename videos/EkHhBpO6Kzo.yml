description: "RubyConf 2018 - Ethical Data Collection for Regular Developers by Colin Fleming\n\nThe DC Abortion Fund collects extremely sensitive data about people seeking abortions. That's terrifying for the engineering team, who are responsible for keeping client data safe! We've made a lot of carefully measured ethical decisions about data intake and usage. In this talk we'll examine how we have done data modeling, collection, and scrubbing, and the ethical reasoning and tradeoffs we've made along the way."
