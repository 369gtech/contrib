description: "Java 9 is just around the corner, but many of us developers have yet to use Java 8 features in an application. This presentation moves beyond slide-size examples of streams and lambdas and shows how to build a fully working end-to-end application with minimal external dependencies and the latest version of Java. You’ll see the presenters build a Java 8 application live. This application will consume a real-time feed of high-velocity data, contain services that make sense of the data, and present it in a JavaFX dashboard. Along the way, you’ll encounter Java 8 streams, lambdas, and new ways of working with collections and bump into the new date and time API\n\nSpeakers:\nTrisha Gee, Developer Advocate, JetBrains\nTrisha has developed Java applications for a range of industries, including finance, manufacturing and non-profit, for companies of all sizes. She has expertise in Java high performance systems, is passionate about enabling developer productivity, and dabbles with Open Source development. Trisha blogs regularly on subjects that she thinks developers and other humans should care about, she’s a leader of the Sevilla Java User Group, a key member of the London Java Community, a MongoDB Master and a Java Champion. She believes we shouldn't all have to make the same mistakes again and again, so now she works for JetBrains where she can tell developers about all the cool stuff she's learnt so far.\n\nJustin Lee, Software Engineer, mongodb.com\nJustin has been a Java developer since 1996 (and can still remember being excited about the upcoming release of the new Swing UI toolkit). Not counting occasional forays in to desktop development, Justin has spent the better part of the last 19 years doing server-side development including building quasi-Java EE application servers and ORMs and helped shepherd websockets support in to first Glassfish/Grizzly and then in to Java EE itself. He is currently a software engineer at MongoDB where he has worked on the Java driver, Morphia, and mongo-hadoop. He speaks as often as he can at conferences and user groups around the world and blogs less than he intends at http://antwerkz.com."
