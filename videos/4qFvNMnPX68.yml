title: 'Carin Meier - Learning to Talk to Machines with Speech Acts'
recordingDate: 1388768412
description: "During a vacation cruise, a programmer's ship encounters a freak storm that leaves her shipwrecked on a desert island. Luckily the contents of one sturdy suitcase makes it to shore. With the help of a computer, Clojure, John McCarthy papers, and a Parrot AR Drone, can she survive until being rescued? Join us for this adventure where we will learn about Speech Acts, the philosophy of language, building a language with Clojure and Instaparse, and communication and friendship with machines.\n\nCarin started off as a professional ballet dancer, studied Physics in college, and has been developing software for both the enterprise and entrepreneur ever since. She has a thing for Clojure and can be usually found with a cup of tea in her hand, hacking on her Roomba and AR Parrot Drone.\n\nShe hails from Cincinnati, where she also helps organize the Cincinnati Functional Programmers and Clojure Code and Coffee user groups."
