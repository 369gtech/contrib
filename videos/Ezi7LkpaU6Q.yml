description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nOpenID Connect as SSO Solution: Strengths and Weaknesses - Álvaro Iradier, Sysdig \n\nOpenID Connect (OIDC), an identity layer on top of OAuth2 protocol, makes user login easier and allows for a seamless SSO experience between multiple tools and services by delegating authentication to a trusted Identity Provider (Authorization Server). The concept is quite appealing at first sight. But different implementations and lack of agreement, both on the client applications and on the Authorization Servers, can ruin your trip.  In this talk we will explain the basic concepts of OIDC, how it works, how it compares to other Federated Authentication systems like SAML, and some integration examples like Harbor or Kubernetes. Then we talk about some common issues that are still rough edges, like the user onboarding and the roles and group management. Finally, we will see how we can make some non-OIDC aware applications work with OIDC by delegating authentication to an Nginx proxy.\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zeka"
