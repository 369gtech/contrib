recordingDate: 1485213186
description: "David Airlie\nhttp://linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/98/\nOpenGL has long been the 3D API used on the Linux platform. However recently the Khronos group released the Vulkan 1.0 standard which covers a new closer to the metal API for 3D graphics programming across multiple operating systems. This talk will provide a brief introduction to the API and how supported the API is under Linux. The speaker will also discuss possible future uses for this new API and the advantages it brings."
