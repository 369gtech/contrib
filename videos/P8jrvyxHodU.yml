description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Chicago 2014\nhttp://gotochgo.com\n\nMartin Odersky - Chairman, Chief Architect & Co-Founder at Typesafe\n\nABSTRACT\nI'd like to take you on a journey to what I think of as the core of Scala. The core is built from a moderate number of general and orthogonal concepts that can be combined quite freely. The parts are simple, but the combinations can be as elaborate and complex as one wants to make them.  \n\nSometimes, the ideal of simplicity clashes with other requirements such as generality, interoperability, or ease of use. In every large engineering project, there are tradeoffs. My talk will highlight some of the simple principles underlying the language and also discuss some of the tradeoffs that had to be faced. \n\nPlease find slides here: http://gotocon.com/dl/goto-chicago-20...\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotochgo\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
