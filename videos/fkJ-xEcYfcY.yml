language: English
recordingDate: 1544126023
description: 'A drone, a PC and a lot of patience. These are all the ingredients you need to start your adventure in the emerging world of flying services. We, as fanatic real-time strategy gamers, wanted our drone to listen to our commands given at the map level, revealing the terrain below it as it flies and creating a coherent and smooth map. However funny and amusing, this will be a presentation about serious, high-level technology, unpredictable ideas and insistent scientific struggle to make all the algorithmic meat work on a flying machine. During this presentation I will tell you how we created our first successful prototype, I will show the demonstration videos and will explain our technology based on video processing, accelerometer data control and localization using particle filtering algorithm. If you are planning to remotely prepare the map of the Moon (or your living room), you cannot miss this presentation.'
