description: "Slides: https://speakerdeck.com/istanbultechtalks/itt-2014-peter-steinberger-architecting-modular-codebases\n\nEveryone knows the pain of convoluted code as an application grows and feature after feature is being added. In this talk Peter will let you explore ideas how to grow your project in a healthy, maintainable way, how to manage dependencies, how to design code around testability, how to write plugins and even some practical solutions around the idea of aspect oriented programming. This is all based on a large-scale 150k lines project and Peter will show some production code as well."
