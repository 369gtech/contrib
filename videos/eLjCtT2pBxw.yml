description: "***** Apache Cassandra Certification Training : https://www.edureka.co/cassandra *****\nIn this Edureka Video, you will learn about Cassandra Data Model and similarities between RDBMS and Cassandra Data Model. You will also understand the key Database Elements of Cassandra (Keyspace, Clusters, Column Family and Rows) and learn about the concept of Primary Key and it's various types.\n\nCourse Objectives:\n\nAfter the completion of 'Apache Cassandra' course at Edureka, you should be able to: \n\n1. Understand Cassandra and NoSQL domain. \n\n2. Create Cassandra cluster for different kinds of applications. \n\n3. Understand Apache Cassandra Architecture. \n\n4. Design and model Applications for Cassandra.\n\n5. Port existing application from RDBMS to Cassandra. \n\n6. Learn to use Cassandra with various programming languages.\n\n\nWho should go for this course?\n\n\nA developer working with large-scale, high-volume websites.\n\nAn application architect or data architect who needs to understand the available options for high-performance, decentralized, elastic data stores \n\nA database administrator or database developer currently working with standard relational database systems who needs to understand how to implement a fault-tolerant, eventually consistent data store \n\nA manager who wants to understand the advantages (and disadvantages) of Cassandra and related columnar databases to help make decisions about technology strategy \n\nA student, analyst, or researcher who is designing a project related to Cassandra or other non-relational data store options.\nPre-requisites\n\nThis course assumes no prior knowledge of Apache Cassandra or any other NoSQL database. Though some familiarity with Linux command line is essential, minimal exposure to Java,database or data-warehouse concepts is required.\n  \n\nWhy should you Learn Cassandra? \n\n1. Cassandra is designed to handle Cassandra workloads across multiple data centers with no single point of failure, providing enterprises with extremely high database performance and availability. \n 2. World's largest Website (i.e Cassandra) is running over Cassandra. \n3. Daily 100s of start-ups and large product companies are choosing Cassandra for their next generation computing and data platforms. Some companies using Cassandra are Facebook, Twitter, IBM, Cisco, Rackspace, NetFlix, eBay, Reddit, @WalmartLabs, Zoho, Digg and so on. \n4. Apache Cassandra is open-source. It means you can deep dive into its source code and change it according to your own requirements. \n5. The job market for Apache Cassandra is at peek and is growing at rate of 300%!\n\n\nPlease write back to us at sales@edureka.co or call us at +91-8880862004 for more information."
