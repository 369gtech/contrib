description: "Speaker: Martin Fowler (@martinfowler), Chief Scientist @ ThoughtWorks\n\nIn the last decade or so we've seen a number of new ideas added to the mix to help us effectively design our software. Patterns help us capture the solutions and rationale for using them. Refactoring allows us to alter the design of a system after the code is written. Agile methods, in particular Extreme Programming, give us a highly iterative and evolutionary approach which is particularly well suited to changing requirements and environments. Martin Fowler has been a leading voice in these techniques and will give a suite of short talks featuring various aspects about his recent thinking about how these and other developments affect our software development.\n\nAbout the speaker\n\nI am an author, speaker… essentially a loud-mouthed pundit on the topic of software development. I work for ThoughtWorks, a software delivery company, where I have the exceedingly inappropriate title of “Chief Scientist”. I’ve written half-a-dozen books on software development, including Refactoring and Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture. I write regularly about software development on martinfowler.com\n\nEvent Page: http://2016.agilesingapore.org\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/Xukq/"
