description: "Don’t worry, It’s more common than you think, and while the symptoms can be terrible the good news is that help is available. You needn’t suffer in silence any more. You can regain a healthy codebase from the comfort of your own home, or surfing a desk chair in an open plan office!\n\nLet’s clarify what technical debt is, how we can measure it, and then give you some practical steps and techniques for reducing it.\n\nRemember that no matter how large you think the problem is, or how bad you think things are, there are small steps and simple changes you can take to improve your situation and get you back to enjoying your development work, not enduring it."
