description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nSongwriter Showcase + Meet & Greet with Michael Hicks + Band \n\nEnjoy a private songwriter showcase performance by Michael Hicks followed by a live virtual meet + greet! Hicks is a unique blend of talent and humility which is rarely found in today’s emerging talent. As an artist, writer, and performer, Hicks is revered as one of the best in the diverse Funk and Soul music scene in Nashville and beyond. His Freshman album, This Is Life, highlights the talents of his writing ability, the moral message of his music, and the production talents of both himself and James Waddell. When he’s not writing and performing his own original music, Hicks is on the road touring the world with Blues icon, Keb’ Mo. International touring has lent him years of maturity that most young artists never get to experience. This interesting blend of influences and experiences have made him “the” artist to watch in Nashville.\n\nhttps://sched.co/dcPw"
