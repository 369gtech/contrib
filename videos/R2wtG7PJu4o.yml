description: "In this session of remote workshops at Codurance Barcelona Javier Chacana, Software Craftsperson at Codurance, will take us on a journey through common situations you have might found yourself dealing with, such as:\n\n-Complex merges\n-Conflicts all around\n-Never-ending Pull Requests\n-Not knowing what you’re doing\nAnd more!\n\nJavier will show us a few tricks and tips that will help deal better with uncontrolled version control.\n\nPragmatic version control can be tricky, especially if you come from CVS or SVN and don’t get the difference between centralised version control and distributed version control.\n\nWith GIT being the de-facto version control system for the last 10 years, many workflows appeared in the horizon. But we’ve forgotten to keep it simple, so in this talk, we’ll go briefly over a few key concepts and then we’ll jump to practical examples, ideally, with participation from the audience. In that case, reach us out so we can set a repository with you.\n\nFor more information about Codurance, please visit our website: https://codurance.com/."
