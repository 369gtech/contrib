language: English
recordingDate: 1592490554
description: "We will create and troubleshoot a Kubernetes workload using Octant, and then open up the conversation for questions. Octant is an easy to use open source tool that lets you visualize a Kubernetes cluster using a Graphical User Interface. It allows you to see workloads with associated objects and has tools that allow you to understand if there are potential issues with your configuration.\n\nPresenter: \n\nWayne Witzel III, Octant Maintainer\_@VMware"
