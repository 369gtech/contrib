description: "Serverless architecture is becoming more and more fashionable and innovative technologies such as Azure Functions allow us to implement it easily. How can we bring into this reality a consolidated product like SQL Server that apparently does not seem to be cut out for these scenarios? In this session we will see how to leverage SQL Server and Azure Functions extensibility to build Serverless solutions.\n\nDocs Pages/CTAs:\nAzure Functions: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview?WT.mc_id=azureserverless-34584-jemorg\nCosmos DB: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/?WT.mc_id=azureserverless-34584-jemorg\nAzure SQL DB: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/?WT.mc_id=azureserverless-34584-jemorg\nLogic Apps: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps//?WT.mc_id=azureserverless-34584-jemorg\nLearn Collection: https://aka.ms/azureserverlessconf/resources \n \nCloud Skills Challenge: https://aka.ms/azureserverlessconf/challenge"
