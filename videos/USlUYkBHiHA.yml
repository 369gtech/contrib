description: "Google I/O 2010 - Architecting for performance with GWT \r\n\r\nGWT 201 \r\n\r\nJoel Webber, Adam Schuck \r\n\r\nModern web applications are quickly evolving to an architecture that has to account for the performance characteristics of the client, the server, and the global network connecting them. Should you render HTML on the server or build DOM structures with JS in the browser, or both? This session discusses this, as well as several other key architectural considerations to keep in mind when building your Next Big Thing. \r\n\r\nFor all I/O 2010 sessions, please go to http://code.google.com/events/io/2010/sessions.html"
