description: "So you’ve decided to migrate from monolith to microservices, what next? Such a redesign to service-oriented architecture (SOA) is a long, arduous journey that benefits from an incremental, iterative approach. Yet, such a migration often must be done while still shipping new features, accelerating developer velocity, and growing the team in addition to ensuring there are no performance regressions. This talk tells the story of Airbnb's journey focusing on how Airbnb is building, operating, and scaling its expanding network of services and changes to its organization to support the migration. \n\nAbout:\nJessica Tai, Software engineer, Airbnb\n\n Jessica has worked at Airbnb for 5 years, starting as a full-stack engineer for the guest and host products and is now an infrastructure engineer on the Core Services team.
