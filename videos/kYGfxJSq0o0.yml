description: "Highly Available Cloud Foundry Deployment for Allstate - Henry Sinclair, Allstate\n\nCloud Foundry has a lot of native features that allows it to run in a highly available manner. However, these features are not enough if you need Cloud Foundry to be highly available across multiple regions particularly for on premise deployments. \n\nThis talk walks you through how Allstate architected and designed an integrated infrastructure designed for maximum resiliency. The design starts from datacenter placement to physical infrastructure isolation, network domain isolation, security zone isolation, and up to application architecture patterns. Allstate redesigned everything including the infrastructure supply chain to optimise infrastructure build and delivery. \n\nIn the end, Allstate has a multi-deployment solution that spans physical regions and availability zones that guarantee a 99.9% up time for applications.\n\nAbout Henry Sinclair\nHenry Sinclair is a Senior Engineer with Allstate Insurance Company working as part of the CompoZed Platform Engineering team. Henry servers as an internal subject matter expert on Cloud Foundry and Highly available systems. Henry has a significant background in large scale Data solutions within Insurance and Financial Institutions. Previously Henry has presented at SQL User Group meet-ups."
