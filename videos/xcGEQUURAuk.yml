description: "No, we wonâ€™t be debating which animal is more adorable but we will be discussing the difference between doing data science locally vs doing data science at scale. Most Data Scientist are aware of working with Python and Pandas but you can only work with small amounts of data. With Koalas, Data Scientist can use all the same API's they are familiar with from Panadas but at scale with PySpark.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
