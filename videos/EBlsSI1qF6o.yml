description: "Deep Dive: Kubernetes (Release) SIG - Tim Pepper & Stephen Augustus, VMware \n\nKubernetes is built through a motley collection of tools used in parallel and redundant ways on different cadences by a decentralized, global developer community. This runs counter to the established quality software engineering practice of a constantly exercised single build/test/release workflow. Our Release Engineering subproject aspires to a unified, deterministic, reproducible, verifiable build system used continually for dev/test as well as periodic official releases. In this SIG Release Deep Dive session we will briefly discuss the history of release engineering in Kubernetes and the build tooling and workflows present today, and then move on to our plans and progress towards commonizing build tooling and workflows, the positive benefits we expect will come in the next few release cycles from this effort, and how you can engage to better the future of Kubernetes. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPjf"
