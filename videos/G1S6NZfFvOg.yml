description: "Most of your development career will be spent fixing and improving existing code. That is called refactoring. In this video, I am going to walk you through a project that is badly in need of some refactoring. Along the way, I will show you some techniques for spotting areas that should be refactored. By the end of the demo, what was a jumbled mess of code should be cleaned up so that it is more readable and reusable.\n\nSource Code: https://leadmagnets.app/?Resource=RefactoringInCSharp\nPatreon: https://patreon.com/IAmTimCorey\nNewsletter signup:  https://signup.iamtimcorey.com/"
