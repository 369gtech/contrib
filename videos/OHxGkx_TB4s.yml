description: "MobileLife is the innovation lab of Danske bank. The employees are 50% from bank background and 50% from startups or similar: \"A start-up with 150 years of banking experience\". MobileLife started with one product, a home search webpage where you're presented only the houses you can afford. After 6 months, the page was about to be released when someone presented it for some \"ordinary people\". They didn't get it at all and, the release was stopped and the whole product was re-made from scratch. Another 6 months later, a new version was released. The difference this time, was that users was an integrated part of the development, resulting in a product that was relevant since day 1. \n\nWith that lesson learned, we never do anything without having users close at hand. Since this also means all our ideas are available for our competitors, we're pushed to make great products that can withstand competition. \n\nChristian Falck är en civilingenjör som fick smak för agil utveckling under två år i ett projekt som mycket väl kunde använts som mall för hur projekt bör styras: Ett samspelt utvecklingsteam som spelade med öppna kort, en engagerad produktägare samt att varje sprint resulterade i en leverans av en användbar produkt. Ett tag senare var han ansvarig för utvecklingen av Handelsbankens mobiltjänst, med utmaningen att arbeta i en IT-organisation på över 1000 personer, i ett företag med gamla traditioner. I dag sitter han som projektledare inom bankvärlden i Danmark och försöker kombinera det bästa från den svenska och den danska arbetskulturen. \n___________________________\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry in the Malmö/Lund region.
