description: 'In my career I''ve created several component libraries, and always found it challenging and rewarding at the same time. The engine we developed at WorkWave is the result of such attempts: it offers a great tradeoff between flexibility and ease of use. Styling with inline styles greatly simplifies the developer''s work while the use of Aphrodite to output real classes enables the full spectrum of css features. I''ll show you the choices we made, what problems have arisen while developing the components and how we solved them, hopefully helping you make better choices for your own libraries.'
