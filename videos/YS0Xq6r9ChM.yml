description: "Unit testing is fine, but without proper integration testing, especially if you work with external resources like databases and other services, you might not know how your application will actually behave once it has been deployed to the real production environment. \n\nTestcontainers is a popular JVM testing library that provides lightweight, throwaway instances of common databases, Selenium web browsers, or anything else that can run in a Docker container. \n\nIn this talk, we will briefly go throught the past, present and the future of the library. \n\nSpoiler! By coming, you will learn new things even if you're an active user of Testcontainers ;)"
