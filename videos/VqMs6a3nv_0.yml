Enterprise Java was being left in the dust in the microservices development environment. Customers were wondering when Java EE 8 was going to complete and what it was going to contain. And, what comes after Java EE? The answer is the Eclipse MicroProfile and Eclipse Jakarta EE projects.\n\nIn this session we will discuss and demonstrate the MicroProfile programming model for developing microservice applications. Although MicroProfile is currently based on Java EE technologies, the expectation is that this will evolve to using the corresponding Jakarta EE technologies. Thus, the synergy between these two Eclipse projects is already starting.\n\nWe will also discuss the current state of the Jakarta EE effort. Demonstrating the building and testing of various Jakarta EE (EE4J) projects is also on the agenda (the exact content to be determined based on the state of the transition efforts).\n\nIvar Grimstad \nFrom Cybercom Sweden\nIvar Grimstad is a Java Champion, Oracle Developer Champion and JUG Leader working as Principal Consultant for Cybercom Group in Sweden.\n\nHe is the PMC Lead for Eclipse Enterprise for Java (EE4J) and involved in the forming of Jakarta EE. He is also in the Java Community Process as a member of the Executive Committee, Spec Lead for JSR 371 (MVC 1.0) and has served as Expert Group Member for a number of JSRs, such as JSR 375 (Java EE Security API).\n\nIvar is also involved in Eclipse MicroProfile as well as being an Apache NetBeans Committer and a frequent speaker at International developer conferences.\n\nKevin Sutter \nFrom IBM\nKevin has been actively developing in Java ever since he could spell \"WebSphere\". Kevin's most recent endeavor is leading the IBM effort on the Eclipse MicroProfile project (http://microprofile.io). He is also a member of the Eclipse EE4J PMC (https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j), which is guiding the effort of moving Java EE to the Eclipse Foundation. Kevin is also participating on the Jakarta EE Steering and Specification committees."
