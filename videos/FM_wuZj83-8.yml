The first is a \"classic\" style protocol that they've been implementing at Demonware (Activision) for Call of Duty back-end services. The second is an actor-based approach in place at Bench Accounting. He explores the benefits, challenges, and lessons learned architecting both Actor and Non-Actor systems.\n\nThis presentation was recorded at QCon London 2018: https://bit.ly/2hxsoN1 \n\nThe next QCon is in San Francisco, Nov 5-7, 2018.
