recordingDate: 1460832968
description: 'If you don''t know your work/span from your fork/join, this talk is for you! By attending this introduction to "thinking parallel," you''ll learn why parallel programming matters, how to think about performance, and how to tackle real-world concerns. You''ll learn about how the fork/join framework embodies best practices. And of course, you''ll learn how Clojure implements these ideas with reducers.'
