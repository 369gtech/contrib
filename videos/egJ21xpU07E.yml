description: "by Maxime Buquet\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/H.1309/xmpp_sprint.webm\n\n\nThis talk will be about how I approached problems organizing sprints, what issues I faced and how I solved them. This summer, on August 18-19th, was held the first developer event in the XMPP community for a long time.\nThe idea came up at the Gulaschprogrammiernacht, in Karlsruhe earlier this year. I set a goal for myself to start a movement in the community, gather interested people, and work together to improve the ecosystem.\nI'm going to talk about how I approached the organizational problems, what issues I faced and how I solved them. \n\nRoom: H.1309 (Van Rijn)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 16:05:00+01"
