Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io\_The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nRedefine Evolvable, Heterogeneous and Full-Plane Orchestration, and Security Enhancement Using Kubernetes - Houming Wang, EasyStack \n\nAs the unified control plane of data centers, Kubernetes needs to support services inherent in the cloud platform and cloud native applications of customers. During the renovation of cloud native applications based on new-generation private cloud and container cloud services, customers are confronted with the following challenges: (1) Unified management of heterogeneous (X86, ARM, and MIPS) and multi-cloud computing resources and integrated O&M based on a unified permission center (2) Unified orchestration of three major types of resource loads (container, VM, and BMS) with the same set of semantics, to smoothen cloud native application renovation? (3) Security enhancement for the container operating environment, to protect cloud native services? Based on the preceding challenges facing customers, we will explain the best practices of using Kubernetes to build new-generation private cloud and container cloud services to support the renovation of cloud native applications. \n\nhttps://sched.co/dINV"
