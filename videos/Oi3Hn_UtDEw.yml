title: 'Build an AI-powered Pet Detector with Python TensorFlow and Visual Studio Code - BRK3014'
recordingDate: 1557362338
description: 'Ever wondered what breed that dog or cat is? Let’s build a pet detector to recognize them in pictures!  We will walk through the training, optimizing, and deploying of a deep learning model using Azure Notebooks and the Azure Machine Learning service. We will use transfer learning to retrain a MobileNet model using TensorFlow to recognize dog and cat breeds using the Oxford IIIT Pet Dataset. Next, we’ll optimize the model using Azure Machine Learning service to improve the model accuracy. Putting on our developer hat, we''ll then refactor the notebooks into Python modules using Visual Studio Code. Finally, we will deploy the model as a web service in Azure. See how Azure and Visual Studio Code has made AI and machine learning easy.'
