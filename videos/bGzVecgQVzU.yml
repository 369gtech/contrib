description: "Web performance is usually looked at one page at a time when we’re trying to measure and optimize our own individual websites. But how do we know how the web community as a whole is performing when it comes to succeeding at making a faster web? For that we need tools that can scale to the size of the web, which is why tools like the Chrome UX Report (CrUX) and HTTP Archive (HA) exist.\n\nCrUX and HA are web transparency tools whose datasets give us insight into the user experience of the web and how it’s built. Using freely available resources like PageSpeed Insights, Data Studio, BigQuery, and others, in this session Rick will look at hands-on ways you can explore and analyze the data to better understand how users are experiencing the web.\n\nRick Viscomi\nSenior Developer Programs Engineer, Google\nhttps://twitter.com/rick_viscomi\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc\n\nSave 10% off any FITC event with discount code 'youtube'.\nSee our upcoming events at www.fitc.ca"
