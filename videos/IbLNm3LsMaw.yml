description: "http://g.co/gtac2013\nSlides: http://goo.gl/sF7Fm\n\nPatrik HÃ¶glund, Google\n\nYes, it is possible to automatically test complex, subjective measurements such as video quality! This talk will show how we constructed a continuous, automated end-to-end test of a WebRTC video call. We'll take a look at the toolchain at a high level and what challenges we ran into while constructing it. This is perfect if you want inspiration for how to take your media testing to the next level."
