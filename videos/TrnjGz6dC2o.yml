title: 'JAX-RS and CDI Bike the Reactive Bridge! by David Delabassee & José Paumard'
language: English
recordingDate: 1510260670
description: "Reactive is the new black! You think that going reactive would be the way to move your application forward but for many reasons you cannot embrace Rx or some other reactive framework. The good news is: you can do it today with Java EE 8 and the JDK!\n\nThis session will explain how JAX-RS and CDI became reactive capable in Java EE 8. We will put some new features of JAX-RS 2.1 and CDI 2.0 into perspective and show some reactive patterns to improve your application. Add Java 8 CompletionStage to the mix and this API trio becomes your best bet to easily go reactive without leaving the Java EE train.\n\n# David Delabassee\nDavid Delabassee is a Software Evangelist working in the GlassFish and Java EE Team at Oracle. Prior to that, he spent more than 10 years at Sun Microsystems focusing on Java end-to-end (from the smart card to the high end server) and the developer tools. He has been involved in Java projects since the early days of this technology. In his spare time, he enjoy tinkering and playing with technologies such as Java, Arduino, Home Automation, Linux, Pinball, etc.\n\n# José Paumard \nJosé is an assistant professor at the Institut Galilée (Université Paris 13) and a PhD in applied mathematics from the ENS de Cachan. He has discovered the Java language in 1995, and has been teaching the Java technologies at the university since 1998. José is also a Java Champion and Java Rockstar.\n\nJosé has also been working as an independant for numerous companies, in a variety of areas. He is a well known Java / Java EE / Software Craftsmanship expert and trainer. He also publishes \"Java le soir\", a technical blog in french (http://blog.paumard.org/), with about 750 pages of courses about Java / JEE in open access."
