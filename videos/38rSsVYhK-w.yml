description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nHow to Build Your Own PaaS from the Cloud Native Landscape - Jared Watts, Upbound\n\nAs the CNCF showed us in a preceding talk, the Cloud Native Landscape is growing fast and now has so many projects and options that end users are having trouble making sense of it all. The end user community would greatly benefit from an effort to turn these cloud native “ingredients” into “recipes”. In this talk, Jared Watts (co-creator of Crossplane) will take us on a deep dive of the technology, design, and implementation of cloud native “solutions” based on Crossplane. This talk builds on the introduction and perspective provided by the CNCF on the need for cloud native recipes, and brings those ideas to life with a practical walkthrough and demonstration."
