description: "Agility, or the ability to respond to change in your market, is often considered one of the most significant predictors of a company’s success. In fact, Agile projects enjoy a 60% greater chance of success compared to more traditional “waterfall” type projects.\n\nBut what is Agile? The concept of an Agile approach is something that gets thrown around a lot. But there can be a lot of confusion about what it actually entails. Is it something to do with walls full of colourful sticky notes? Is it fancy project management software? Or something you can only learn from specialised consultants?\n\nIn this workshop, we’ll go over the key and most important concepts and processes of Agile product development, and how you can apply it to your own organisation.\n\nLucy Broomfield, UX Craftsperson at Codurance Spain.\n\nIn English and in collaboration with Agile Sur.\nFor more information about Codurance, please visit our website: https://codurance.com/."
