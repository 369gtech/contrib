description: "Understanding exchange network dynamics with Python\nOmer Yuksel\nAudience level:\n\nThis talk covers a use-case for Python ecosystem at IMC for modelling and understanding trade network dynamics, and predicting the results of the changes we introduce. Approaching the problem from different angles, it will include examples of supervised learning, probabilistic models and discrete-event simulations using modules such as scikit-learn, pymc3, and simpy.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
