description: "Domain-Driven Design Europe 2019\nhttps://dddeurope.com\nhttps://twitter.com/ddd_eu\n\nThe journey to Outcome Oriented teams \n\nIn today’s business climate, market responsiveness is more important than cost-efficiency, e.g. your business idea can be outrun by other competitors in one night. However, the most of businesses are still organized around cost and functional orientation by having business units, “core” teams and centralized operations. In this talk, I would like to share a true story of what it takes to evolve from functional to market-oriented mindset and how you can support and coach the leadership team to buy-in the idea and motivate the teams to enable it across the organization.\n\nBiography\n\nEngineering Excellence Evangelist passionate about enabling organizations to improve by cultivating a culture of Continuous Improvement at all levels, using Agile, Continuous Delivery, DevOps, Lean, Scrum, Kanban, Value Stream Mapping and data-driven decision making. Although a nerd at heart, I also have almost a decade of experience in coaching the entire organizations in doing product development with a focus on continuously adding business value."
