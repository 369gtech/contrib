description: "Jake Archibald on Instant Loading: Building offline-first Progressive Web Apps \n\nFor most of the web, poor network connectivity destroys the user experience. We can do better. In this session we'll take an online-only site and turn it into a fully network-resilient, offline-first installable progressive web app, and this won't involve rebuilding from scratch; it'll be done in small iterations, with each step improving the user experience whether they're offline, online, or anything in between. This session will cover ServiceWorker, web manifests, add-to-homescreen banners, IndexedDB and BackgroundSync APIs.\n\nWatch more Chrome talks at I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/JoMLpB \nSee all the talks from Google I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/olw6kV\nSubscribe to the Chrome Developers channel at http://goo.gl/LLLNvf \n\n#io16 #GoogleIO #GoogleIO2016"
