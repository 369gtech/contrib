title: 'No-frills REST API testing with REST-Assured by Michel Schudel'
language: English
recordingDate: 1510141205
description: "As the number of REST based services in our application landscape grows, we better make sure they are tested really well! Component-Testing REST API's (that is, testing the REST API against a fully deployed artifact) can be a bit of a pain, however, using existing solutions like SoapUI, PostMan, or Cucumber.\n\nEnter REST-Assured, a library that makes testing REST APIs fun and easy!\n\nOn my current project, we are now using REST-Assured to do REST testing. REST-assured uses a concise, 100% Java DSL (with some Groovy underneath), to test against REST APIs. Using this library really cleaned up our existing tests and sped up the process of writing new REST tests!\n\nIn this tools-in-action session, I will give a REST-Assured demo to test the REST interface of an existing REST service (written in Spring Boot), including request and response specification re-use and handling authentication. I will also show how you can integrate REST-Assured in Spring and SpringBoot integration tests.\n\nMichel Schudel has been a passionate Java developer since 1998, building various Java solutions for banks, insurance companies and telecom providers. Since then he has seen the good, the bad and the ugly in Java land. He loves agile development and coding with micro and meso frameworks like SpringBoot and SparkJava to get up-and-running as fast as possible. Futhermore, he likes to coach junior developers in Core Java. Michel is currently working for Dutch Railways in the Netherlands."
