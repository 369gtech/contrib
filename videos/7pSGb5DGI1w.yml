recordingDate: 1447710231
description: "Rosalind Radcliffe, Distinguished Engineer, Chief Architect for DevOps and CLM, IBM\n\nMany organizations have very limited automated testing for their mainframe applications. This lack of test automation has many historical causes, now is the time to start improving the situation. With the concepts of shift left testing, and the new tooling specifically targeted to improving test capability on z/OS, there are opportunities to quickly improve the lack of testing. This session will discuss the state of the current environment and some options teams are doing to build up their test automation even for the Mainframe applications. This will include a discussion of zUnit as well as integration testing and using virtual services to improve early testing."
