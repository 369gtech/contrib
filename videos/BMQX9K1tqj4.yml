title: 'From Containers to Kubernetes Operators by Philipp Krenn at DevOps Unicorns'
recordingDate: 1571145818
description: "“Containers are the new ZIP format to distribute software” is a fitting description of today’s development world. However, it is not always that easy and this talk highlights the development of Elastic’s container strategy over time. In this talk, Philipp is going to talk about such points as:\nDocker images: A new distribution model.\nDocker Compose: Local demos and a little more.\nHelm Chart: Going from demo to production.\nKubernetes Operator: Full control with upgrades, scaling, etc.\n\nBesides the strategy, he is also going to discuss specific technical details and hurdles that appeared during the development. Or why the future will be a combination of Helm Chart and Operator (for now)."
