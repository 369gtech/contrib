title: 'DrupalCon Nashville 2018: Growing Our Tribes: Creating Sustainable Micro-Communitiaes'
recordingDate: 1523471321
description: "\"There's only 30 hours left to solve Rules module's remaining problems. We have so many people signed up, we will have to tell some no.\" -- Said no one, ever.\n\nThis is a problem for Drupal. If we want to remain a leading community, we need to find better ways to foster our tribes and give them the tools they need to grow into thriving micro-communities.\n\nJoin this talk to hear ideas about how we can make that first statement true, I'll share my progress at creating a kit to help reduce the pain of creating a network within the Drupal community, keeping people focused on priorities (designated cat-herder supports), and finally, attracting more than just developers to your cause.\n\nThis talk aims to answer the questions:\n\nWhat is it exactly that makes it so hard to get involved?\nWhy is there such a low diversity of contributors among skillsets? (Devs, vs PM, vs UX, vs Other roles)\nWhat solutions do we have today? Why are they succeeding or failing at growing focused, thriving groups of contributors?\nWhat are other communities doing?\nWhat could we be doing better?\nHow do we get there?\nLet's talk about the future of Drupal community development and how to create communities within Drupal that are inclusive to non-developer profiles and provide solutions to jumpstart people's passions!"
