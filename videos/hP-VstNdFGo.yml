description: "Speaker: Charles O'Farrell\r\n\r\nTesting is an essential part of writing and maintaining correct and reliable software. However, for the most part the best technique we have for writing tests is to capture some examples in the hope that they cover all the known edge cases. Unfortunately these examples are almost always missing something.\_ \r\n\r\nThis talk will explore the motivation and concepts behind this powerful testing technique. We also introduce a number of simple but useful patterns that can be applied again and again when writing properties. In addition this talk will highlight a handful of compelling examples of Property Based Testing uncovering nasty bugs in real world software. \r\n\r\nFinally, apart from learning about why and how to use Property Based Testing to write better software, the audience will also realise that testing can be made more enjoyable in the process.\_\_ Learn more from our speaker Charles O'Farrell.
