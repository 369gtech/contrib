title: 'Prototyping an internet connected smart home device with Azure IoT hub - THR2020'
recordingDate: 1557359439
description: "We live in a time of internet connected everything. There are now many devices in our home that report information over the internet and can be controlled by our mobile phones. But how do you build one of these?\r\n\r\nIn this session we look at how to create a prototype interconnected fan unit using an IoT prototyping board. This board will connect to Azure to upload sensor data, and connect to a fan turning it on if the temperature is above a threshold. The threshold will then be made configurable using Azure device twin, allowing it to be easily controlled from a cloud-connected mobile app via Azure Functions. The principles you will see in the session can then be applied to a production system running on appropriate custom hardware.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the session you will see the power of Azure IoT hub for building internet connected smart devices."
