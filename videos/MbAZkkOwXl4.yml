description: "The Unilever Journey So Far: Finding the Speed to Innovate with DevOps\n\nKjersten Moody, VP Information & Analytics, Unilever\nSarah Chong, DevOps Evangelist, Unilever\n\nOrganisations are quickly discovering that they can test and launch digital products, tools and services faster, and at a lower cost by integrating their development and IT operations teams. This process has become a competitive advantage for many and Unilever has been working on capturing its full value potential. \n\nIn this short keynote speech Kjersten Moody, VP Information & Analytics and Sarah Chong, DevOps Evangelist will discuss the need to emphasize the sharing of information and processes across product-development and IT operations groups to enable the frequent release of small internal updates, alongside appropriate tooling and metrics for success. They will talk about how the journey started at Unilever, the change in culture required to have impact, success stories and what next with DevOps.\n\nDOES16 London\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/eur/"
