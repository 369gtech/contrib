description: "How Quicker Can This Get!? Create a Cloud Foundry App in Minutes with CI/CD - Debjani Chatterjee, IBM\n\nThis talk is for anyone who's getting familiar with cloud-native and has just heard about Cloud Foundry. Or for a beginner getting started with creating web apps quickly. In this session, Debjani will explore the seamless developer experience Cloud Foundry provides while deploying an app in a few minutes on a Cloud platform. She will also create a continuous delivery pipeline for the app so that any changes made on the Git repo will be automatically integrated to trigger a new build to reflect the changes on the app. The demo will be followed by a question and answer session open to all participants. This presentation is intended for users who would like to get their first hands-on experience or for others who might want to evaluate an alternative deployment option."
