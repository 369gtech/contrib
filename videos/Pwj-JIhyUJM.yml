title: 'Real World Use Cases  Hadoop and NoSQL in Production - Tugdual Grall'
recordingDate: 1464358762
description: 'What’s important about a technology is what you can use it to do. I’ve looked at what a number of groups are doing with Apache Hadoop and NoSQL in production, and I will relay what worked well for them and what did not. Drawing from real world use cases, I show how people who understand these new approaches can employ them well in conjunction with traditional approaches and existing applications. Thread Detection, Datawarehouse optimization, Marketing Efficiency, Biometric Database are some examples exposed during this presentation.'
