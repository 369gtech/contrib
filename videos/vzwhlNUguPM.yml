title: 'Learning Object Appearance Models via Transformed...'
recordingDate: 1191897039
description: "Google Tech Talks\nMarch 6, 2007\n\nABSTRACT\n\nObject recognition systems use features extracted from images to localize and categorize objects. Such methods must be robust to the rich variability of natural scenes, and the often small size of training databases. In this talk, we describe hierarchical generative models for objects, the parts composing them, and the scenes surrounding them. We employ Dirichlet processes to learn flexible appearance models which transfer knowledge among related object categories. By coupling part-based models with spatial transformations, we also consistently account for geometric constraints. Through Monte Carlo methods, we use these transformed Dirichlet processes to..."
