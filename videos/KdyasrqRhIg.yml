description: "I would like to present the techniques, tools & process that we employ during our daily work to build high-quality apps for our clients. Not a code-heavy, deep-down into our architecture kinda talk, but a high-level behind the scenes about our process to move from prototyping to design and to production. We want to stay nimble during development, and quickly iterate over features, which we like to accomplish through frequent releases, often paired with A/B testing. At the same time, we are convinced that building robust applications is helped with a Continuous Delivery setup where we highly value an automated test strategy. Working in an agile way while focusing on good architecture, testing and reporting took us some effort, and I’d like to explore how we run our projects trying to be as effective and collaborative as possible...\n\nFilip Maelbrancke is a software consultant at AppFoundry in Belgium. He mainly works on Android projects in the financial services, telecom and media sectors as a developer and tech lead.\n\n[VOW-7651]"
