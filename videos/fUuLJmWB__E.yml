description: "spray (www.spray.cc) is a suite of lightweight Scala libraries for building and consuming RESTful web services on top of Akka.\n\nIn this talk Mathias will show you how spray makes it easy to supply your Scala applications with a high-performance, fully asynchronous REST/HTTP API, no matter whether Akka is already a key component in your application stack or not. The talk will briefly highlight the design goals and key concepts behind spray before showing off one or more real-world examples as well as emerging best-practices with regard to architecture and development process.\n\n** Videos sponsored by Typesafe (http://typesafe.com) and Marakana.\n** Slides available at http://mrkn.co/1tlg3"
