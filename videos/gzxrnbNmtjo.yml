title: 'Deploy microservices confidently using Consumer Driven Contracts - Henrik Stene'
recordingDate: 1542974668
description: "Consumer Driven Contracts is a testing paradigm that let API-consumers communicate to the API-providers how they are using their services. This talk discusses software testing, how and when to use Consumer Driven Contract, and how Consumer Driven Contracts can make developers more confident. It also includes live coding to show how to implement Consumer Driven Contracts using the Pact framewo\nTo increase the velocity and reduce the cost of microservices development, it is key to be able to build and deploy new versions with confidence that you don't break any dependencies. Microservices are easy to build and run, but they quickly become a tangled web of dependencies that slow down development and result in broken dependencies. Organisations that transition from a traditional monolithic design to a microservice architecture, will soon realise that it is hard to keep track of all dependencies. Consumer Driven Contracts is a testing paradigm that helps developers keep control on all dependencies in a distributed system and this talk will tell more about how to use it and show how to do so in a live demo.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcsydney.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
