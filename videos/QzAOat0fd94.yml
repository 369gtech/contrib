description: "Agile Transformation: how business fake it and what it needs to make it\n\nIn the market there are quite a few companies, telling they do Agile, however that Agile is just an echo from what real Agile looks and feels. As well there are lots of fake Agile transformations happening that lead to more meetings and roles but no real value behind it. It could get a pass as a cosmetic transformation but there is no business value beneath the surface. Real transformation must provide business value and improve business agility. In my presentation I will share my view on Agile business transformation, most common mistakes, what pitfalls you should be aware of. And of course there will be tips and tricks: what leaders should be aware of and how to navigate through transformation, what is the role of scrum masters, as well what to do with the culture."
