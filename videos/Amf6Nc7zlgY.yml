description: "What if we saw WordPress as a force of change on the web and in society? We talk about our aspiration to reach 50%, but we rarely talk about how we could and should use the power that comes with that market share. Starting from the WordPress philosophy of “democratizing publishing through free open source software,” this talk explores how — through code, community, and political engagement — WordPress can be used to move the web, the internet, and our society forward.\n\nEVENT:\n\nWordCamp 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nMorten Rand-Hendriksen\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-vt7M7RsUw"
