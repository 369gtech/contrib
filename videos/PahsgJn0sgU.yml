description: "Grab the latest polymer-redux and give it a go! Click here: https://goo.gl/fGUSf4\n\nHow do you manage state in a large Polymer app? This is probably the most frequently asked question we get on Polycasts.\n\nToday we're going to start tackling this problem using the Redux library and an adapter written for Polymer called polymer-redux.\nExplaining all of the concepts in Redux are outside of the scope of this project but I've included some links down below to get you started. And don't worry, we'll be doing a number of follow up episodes on this topic so we'll be sure to cover our bases!\n\npolymer-redux\nhttps://github.com/tur-nr/polymer-redux\n\nRedux Docs\nhttp://redux.js.org/\n(Note that the Redux docs assume you're using React so a lot of the example code doesn't apply to using polymer-redux)\n\nPolycasts playlist: https://goo.gl/r5fsMq \nPolymer Slack: http://bit.ly/polymerslack\n\nSubscribe to the Chrome Developers channel: https://goo.gl/OUF4e2"
