title: 'Victor Savkin - Managing State in Angular Applications'
recordingDate: 1544211057
description: "Managing state is a hard problem. We need to coordinate multiple backends, web workers, and UI components, all of which update the state concurrently. Patterns like Redux make some of this coordination explicit, but they donâ€™t solve the problem completely. It is much broader.\n\nWhat should we store in memory and what in the URL? How do we synchronize the client-side state, the URL, and the state on the server? All these questions have to be answered when designing the state management of our applications.\n\nIn this talk Victor will cover typical mistakes we make managing state, and the patterns we should use instead.\n\nVictor Savkin\nhttps://twitter.com/victorsavkin\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc\n\nSave 10% off any FITC event with discount code 'youtube'.\nSee our upcoming events at www.fitc.ca"
