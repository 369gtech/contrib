title: 'YOW! Perth 2019 - Beth Skurrie - Microservices. Test smarter, not harder'
recordingDate: 1571115460
description: "Microservices and serverless functions have become mainstream now. Writing and deploying small, independent applications has many benefits, but on the downside, it increases the number of integration points, which increases the amount of integration testing required. How can we be confident that all our services will work correctly together, without being burdened by increasingly complex and brittle integration tests? Learn how Pact solves this problem by using consumer driven contracts, allowing you to escape Integration Testing Hell and ship your code with speed and confidence.\n\nBeth became a developer not because she particularly likes computers, but because she loves to solve problems and make things that are useful. Her involvement with the open source project, Pact, has led to speaking opportunities at conferences around Australia. Bethâ€™s favourite things to do at work are talking about Pacts and deleting code.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
