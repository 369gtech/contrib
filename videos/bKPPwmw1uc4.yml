description: "Machine learning has taken over huge parts of our world, from diagnosis of medical conditions to legal queries to beating human players in Go. How does this affect how we design, build, and manage products? Rather than trying to design a single route through an experience or product, when working with machines it’s about working out all the possible outcomes and how to handle those. Product Managers are going to be key in this process, if we hope to create products that are going to positively impact people's’ lives, rather than simply embed the injustices of the past.\n\nEVENT:\n\nMind the Product London 2017\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nJosh Clark\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nMind The Product: https://www.mindtheproduct.com/"
