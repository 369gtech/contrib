description: "All too often, products are brought to market with a feature-first approach. A list of functions that are needed to meet business goals such as sign-ups or downloads, views or shares. There’s little thought that’s gone into who the user of the product will be, what their goals are, and what it will take to provide meaningful value to them.\n\nWe’ll look at what it means to bring a focused, valuable Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to market. An MVP that can help you learn how to better serve your users, and the business that’s footing the bill.\n\nLee Dale\nCo-founder, Say Yeah!\nhttp://twitter.com/smack416\nhttp://ca.linkedin.com/in/smack416\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
