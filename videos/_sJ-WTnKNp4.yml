description: "DevConf - The Software Craftsmen Festival for Sharing Knowledge and Inspiration (https://devconf.pl/)\n\nServerless computing or FaaS is one of the most popular areas in the cloud nowadays. That is because if it delivers what it promises, we are looking at the next big thing. But, is it the case? As someone who has experienced how Serverless/FaaS has evolved in the last three years, I’ll talk about how it all started and where it is going now. There will be some fun and real cases where Serverless caused us problems and empowered us going faster. After sharing some of my experiences, we’ll try to answer or get even more confused on the future of Serverless!"
