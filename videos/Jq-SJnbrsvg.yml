description: "Agile Tour Vilnius 2020. The New Normal\n\nFairy tales are useful and true, because they help us make sense of the world around us. Through this workshop, I will bring the power of storytelling together with group discussions, in order for us to uncover the wisdom hidden behind the text.\nWe'll start with a story, a fairy tale being read, and look between the lines to see what it means to each of us. We will also share with others, in small groups, what we understood from that story.\nIn doing so, we will work with understanding and listening to one another, as well as creating a shared meaning and understanding.\nThis can only happen when we let go of our certainty and I do believe that this is what the world currently needs the most."
