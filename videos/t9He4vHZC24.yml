description: "\"GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those requests. GraphQL APIs are extremely powerful as clients use schema information to custom tailor their queries to only ask for the data they need.\n\nKotlin strong types and null safety makes it an excellent choice for implementing GraphQL schemas. With a resolver-first approach, graphql-kotlin generates schemas directly from the source code, making it the single source of truth for defining your GraphQL APIs. Using this approach, your Kotlin classes, properties and functions are mapped to corresponding GraphQL types and fields. GraphQL queries are resolved by invoking underlying Kotlin functions, so we can also utilize the power of Kotlin coroutines to asynchronously process all of our requests!\n\nLearn how to utilize the power of Spring Boot together with graphql-kotlin to easily create new reactive GraphQL web services in 15 minutes or less!\"\n\nGuillaume Scheibel, Principal Engineer at Expedia Group; Dariusz Kuc, Principal Engineer at Expedia Group\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/bootiful-graphql-with-kotlin"
