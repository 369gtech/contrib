description: "Psychological safety is one of the leading indicators of a high performing team. Yet, forging deep human relationships and building trust can be difficult when your team is distributed or largely interacts on screens.\n\nBeyond the practical considerations of time zones, remote isolation, cultural differences, and “can you hear me now?” connection issues, there are added, real barriers in our psychology and biology that make building strong teams over distances and screens harder than for teams all in one place. Yet, with the right conditions, distributed teams can be stronger, more deliberate, and produce better results than ones where everyone shares the same lunch table.\nIn this talk, I will share my learnings on how to hone connection, communication, and collaboration on distributed teams. We will dive into how you can utilise these three aspects to help your engineers shape their day-to-day interactions for relationship building, design processes for creating trust, and fostering an inclusive culture. Regardless if you’re managing teams across the world or within the same building, learning these approaches will help you become more strategic, communicate better, and build highly aligned, well-connected and strong teams that deliver great products.\n\nAbout Lena Reinhard\nLena is currently Director of Engineering at CircleCI, the leader in continuous integration and delivery for developer teams. After a career in finance, arts, and media, Lena found herself working in tech and at age 26 co-founded her first software company and became a CEO. Ever since, she’s been supporting globally distributed engineering organisations, helping them deliver great products while continuously learning through inclusive cultures and growth-oriented feedback. Lena is convinced that only diverse teams in inclusive organisations can build appropriate solutions for the challenges that humanity is facing. She is also a proficient writer, photographer, and forever a learner."
