recordingDate: 1485234446
description: "As one of the founders of AltConf, I’ve had a unique view on the biggest week of the year for iOS and macOS developers, WWDC. AltConf has grown from a small seed to one of the biggest Apple developer conferences in the world, and a focal point for developers, designers and everyone in the community. We’ve changed over time, but always put the community at the heart of what we do and why we do it.\n\nJoin me to hear the origin story of AltConf, how we’ve evolved over the years, as well as the inside stories of our journey, and how we deal with the public pressure and high expectations.\n\nRob is the founder of AltConf, the Apple Developer community’s biggest independent conference. As well as working on bringing a great event to the community, he also leads technology teams as the CTO of busuu, the world’s largest social network for language learning.\n\nFor more on YOW!
