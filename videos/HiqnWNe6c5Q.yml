description: "Distributed systems, microservices, containers and persistence, and serverless too ... modern infrastructure is ever more fluid and dynamic, chaotic and transient. Most of our tools evolved in a past era of known-unknowns (for systems) and distinct roles (for humans). But today's software engineer is increasingly expected to build with an eye toward resiliency and scalability, and even do their own primitive operational tooling. And today's systems are increasingly a mess of unknown-unknowns that require a structured approach to gathering detail and a very exploratory, open-ended approach to debugging. But these aren't two distinct trends: rather, they are two sides of a single coin.\n\nLet's talk about what the model engineer of the near future looks like, and how they practice a form of \"observability-driven development\" rather than just TDD. We will talk about what ownership means, and do a deep dive into why your tools are failing you and what you should look for in an observability tool kit that actually answers your questions and meets your needs.\n\nWebsite: https://boston.serverlessdays.io/"
