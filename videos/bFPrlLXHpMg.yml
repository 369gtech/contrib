description: "Dan-ya Shwartz, Data Scientist @ Alooma\n\nWhat is a personal brand? Should I have one? Where can I get it? What is it good for? Do I have to write content or speak publicly? Are we there yet?\nThese are some of the questions that Dan-ya has been asking herself for the past 5 years, ever since she decided to step out from behind her desk and come out as a person with opinions and professional experience. In this talk, Dan-ya shares from her personal journey and tries to give some general tips on how to do it yourself."
