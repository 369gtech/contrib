description: "RubyConf 2019 - Ruby Next: make old Ruby quack like a new one by Vladimir Dementyev\n\nRuby 2.7 is just around the corner. It will bring a lot of new features, including new syntax additions: pattern matching, numbered parameters.\n\nThat's good news. The bad news is that not many of us will be able to use these goodies right away: the upgrade cost blocks application developers; gem authors have to support older versions.\r\n\nWhat if we were able to use Ruby Next features while running Ruby Current? Maybe, we can cast a metaprogramming spell for that? Yes, we can. And I'll show you how.\n\n#confreaks #rubyconf2019"
