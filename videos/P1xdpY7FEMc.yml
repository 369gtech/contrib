description: "What does it mean to develop a good interaction - without any visual aids? Natural Language Processing (NLP) has opened the door to communicating vocally, and made more easy to develop with popular platform APIs and in-home devices like Google Home and Amazon Echo.\n\nHow do you start thinking about building for one of these platforms, or all of them? We will go over what has to be kept in mind for the development life cycle and empower you to make the architectural decisions that make sense with this emerging software skillset. This is a high level architectural and voice design discussion to avoid pitfalls and enhance user delight with your chatbot or voice skill."
