description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io\_The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nMetering & Billing System Based on Universal Model for Cloud Native System - Anne Song & Dan Ma, QingCloud Technologies Corp. \n\nCloud native service is much more elastic and customizable than traditional cloud service. Computing power, storage and network capability should be realtime allocated on demand, metrics for metering and parameters for billing are complicated, product pricing strategies will count on many parameters not only include resource metrics, and different resource providers will use different procedure on resource creation and releasing, so hard-coded metering/billing system can not meet fast-growing requirements. A universal model for pricing, standard API for metering and billing is a strong requirement in cloud-native era. Also, the metering/billing system itself should be realtime, robust, scalable and secure. In this topic, a metering/billing model is proposed to fullfill all these requirements, and a working system is implemented according the model. \n\nhttps://sched.co/cp9C"
