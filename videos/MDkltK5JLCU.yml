description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nIs Sharing GPU to Multiple Containers Feasible? - Samed Güner, SAP \n\nProvisioning GPUs for ML workloads in data center can be very costly and more costly if they are not fully utilized. Thus, maximizing the GPU utilization is a must for ML workloads.  This session will show how a single GPU can be used to run multiple ML workloads, especially ML inference, in parallel and will deep dive into the understanding of how GPUs are provisioned and attached using K8s device plugins. It will show how the nvidia device plugin can be extended to schedule multiple ML workloads to a single GPU and collect desired GPU information with Prometheus.  This session will highlight and deep dive into native GPU sharing using K8s device plugin without additional technologies such as vGPUs from VMware.\n\nhttps://sched.co/ZesB"
