description: "Glenn Kasten, Ian Ni-Lewis, Raph Levien \n\nIt'??s not that hard to play a background soundtrack in your mobile game app, or to play short clips of sound in response to user actions. But how about responsive reliable audio, that doesn'??t glitch, works well across a range of devices, and doesn'??t eat up your user's battery? Oh, and is lower latency too? It turns out that's not so easy. We'??ll share our own experiences with the Android platform and apps, discuss the problem areas and the work we√¢??ve been doing in the platform, and give some techniques you can apply now in your own apps. We assume you'??re familiar with OpenSL ES and audio terminology.\n\nFor all I/O 2013 sessions, go to https://developers.google.com/live"
