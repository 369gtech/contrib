description: "We are living in a constantly changing world with increasing IT challenges both in size and complexity.\nSorting out these challenges and turning them into opportunities requires a creative, adaptable, and effectively allocated team.\n\nUnderstanding underlying differences in diverse teams, such as differences in functional background, education, or personality, can facilitate creativity or group problem solvingâ€”but only when a group process is well defined.\n\nIn this talk we will explore the idea of group process and diversity beyond race/ethnicity, gender, or age.\n\nIx-chel Ruiz has developed software application & tools since 2000. Her research interests include dynamic languages, testing and client-side technologies. Systems Administration (*nix on the top), Data Modeling and IA are among her career passions."
