description: "To survive and grow, technology companies need to align themselves with, and invest in, sustainability, diversity, inclusion and social impact. Drawing on the United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Development Goals, research by Ernst & Young, The Boston Consulting Group, and others, I will make the case that companies not aligned with these goals will lack the resilience and strength to face the challenges that lie ahead—from competitors, from the environment, and from the workforce. Finally, we will look at some positive examples and talk about what the next steps for your company, startup, or other organisation/conference/meetup might be. Tech companies are well placed to make this transition. As an industry, as well as software and hardware we have experience with disruptive innovation and have learnt how to apply lean and agile methodologies to new industries. People from Clayton Christensen to Bill Gates believe these are keys to resilience and impact in all sectors.\n\nMark provides software R&D and other consulting services with The High Technology Bureau. He is the convenor of Sydney CocoaHeads, the co-chair of YOW! Connected Conference, and has been involved with many other meet ups and conferences. Over his grey hair inducing career he has worked across a wide range of sectors including medical devices, banking, retail, and management consulting.\n\nFor more on YOW! conferences, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
