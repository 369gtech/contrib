language: English
recordingDate: 1542390301
description: "Struggling to get your website to load in less than 5 seconds on a mobile phone? Switching pages are a little sluggish? You’re not alone! Most web developers can build a responsive site, but fail to meet performance requirements for mobile. Using the latest PRPL pattern and Progressive Web API’s, you can provide a compelling alternative to native apps, as long as you focus on performance from the beginning. \n\nThis talk will cover why the performance of your site is so important and dive into the Chrome performance tools to explain exactly how a browser loads a site and what causes things to slow down. Lastly, we’ll cover how to create your own PWA with service workers and app installs.\n\nEVENT:\n\nNode+JS Interactive 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nChris Lorenzo, Comcast\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nThe Linux Foundation provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRZN7W1dTPo"
