description: "Check out the latest from The Lead Developer at theleaddeveloper.com.\n\nAre you sick of seeing your team treated as a sausage machine for turning user stories into code? Can your developers only talk about how long something will take, or how exactly it will be built?\n\nIn this talk, I’ll explore how to get your team focused on delivering customer value instead by:\n\nAsking questions that refine stories to deliver value more effectively, rather than estimating story points and technical tasks.\nBuilding and refining backlogs around customer journeys, rather than breaking down epics into prioritised lists of stories.\nYou’ll take home practices that will help your team start talking about customer value first."
