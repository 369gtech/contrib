description: "In this session we answered a question about simulating a currently non-existent SQL function NLS_BASELETTER that would return a string with all accents (diacritic marks) stripped. Such function could be useful to prepare a version of text data (e.g. people names) for approximate search. (Note, however, that we recommend Oracle Text for advanced searching functionality.)\n\nAskTOM Office Hours offers free, monthly training and tips on how to make the most of Oracle Database, from Oracle product managers, developers and evangelists.\n\nhttps://asktom.oracle.com/\n\nOracle Developers portal: https://developer.oracle.com/\nSign up for an Oracle Cloud trial: https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/tryit"
