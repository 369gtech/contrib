title: 'Ian Luites | Wobserver: Easy to Integrate Monitoring and Debugging'
language: English
recordingDate: 1496407711
description: "Filmed in Barcelona at ElixirConf EU 2017\n\nErlang comes packed with a great tool for manually monitoring, debugging, and visualizing Elixir processes: observer. However, it is not always possible to use observer to monitor due to restrictions in the current world of mixed ecosystems, micro services, and docker containers. We offer a new solution :wobserver. It will allow you to directly monitor any node, while offering additional options like:\n \n - web interface, view from anywhere, from any system [with a browser]\n - api, json api for automated monitoring or integration with other applications\n - system metrics, pre-formatted metrics, simple to integrate with other software\n - node discovery, discover nodes behind load balancers and view them all through one single interface\n - simple, just add it to your mix file and you are up and running\n\nIn the talk we will go through the background of the project and show you how to mount :wobserver into a Phoenix application, hook it up to Prometheus, and deploy it behind a load balancer.\n\nElixirConf EU is a community conference created to promote education, networking and collaboration within the Elixir/Erlang/Ruby communities."
