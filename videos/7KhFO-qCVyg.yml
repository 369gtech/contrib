description: "A typical interaction with a device or interface involves touching it. Either you’re pressing buttons on a controller, swiping on a touchscreen or clicking on your laptop’s trackpad. But what if you could control things without the use of your hands? What if you could use… your thoughts?\n\nI have been tinkering with a brain sensor and developed an open source JavaScript framework for it to allow me (or anyone else) to control interfaces or robots using facial expressions and mental commands.\n\nOMG JSConf EU is coming back in 2019 https://2019.jsconf.eu/"
