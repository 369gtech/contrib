title: 'YOW! Conference 2018 - Mikael Vidstedt - Java in a World of Containers'
recordingDate: 1551996000
description: "Java in a World of Containers\n\nContainer technologies such as Docker are rapidly becoming the de-facto way to deploy cloud applications, and Java is committed to being a good container citizen. This talk will cover some of the new tools and techniques for reducing container size (jlink, Alpine/musl support), for improving startup time and sharing of data between JVMs (AppCDS and ahead-of-time compilation), and the recent work that has gone into interacting with container resource limitations.\n\nMikael Vidstedt is Director of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) in the Java Platform Group at Oracle. Over the last 20 years he has been working all the various aspects of the Java and JVM technologies, focusing on everything from compilers and optimization to operating systems and server virtualization. He has worn many hats, including that of JVM tech lead and Architect. Mikael holds a master's degree in Computer Science from the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Stockholm and is based in Santa Clara, CA.\n\nFor more on YOW!
