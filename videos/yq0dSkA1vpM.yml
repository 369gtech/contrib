title: 'WinForm vs WPF vs UWP vs Console - The C# Desktop UI Showdown (and the future with .NET 5)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1559563218
description: "Which C# desktop UI should I use? Is the latest one the best? Is WinForms dead? Aren't Console applications super-old technology? These are all questions I get on a weekly basis so I thought I would take some time and walk through the four major options for desktop applications. We will discuss the benefits and drawbacks of each UI, and then we will discuss the future. \n\nOne of these platforms is finally dying, and it probably isn't the one you think.\n\nAt the end, we will also discuss the future of the .NET Framework, .NET Core, and .NET 5 so that you can properly understand the direction you need to head going forward.\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/IAmTimCorey\n\nNewsletter signup (with exclusive discounts, giveaways, and more):  https://signup.iamtimcorey.com/"
