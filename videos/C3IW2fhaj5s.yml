description: "Code Mesh London is the best place in Europe for non-mainstream tech and programming languages. On 4-5 December 2013 over 50 inventors and originators of the most innovative languages and technologies of the moment shared their experience with 200 attendees. Topics included Scala, Haskell, Clojure, Erlang, Elixir, Julia and much more. See you at Code Mesh 2014! codemesh.io/\n\nAbout the talk:\nIt's already been shown that F# is a brilliant language for the likes of machine learning and finance, but it's capable of so much more. In this session I'll go over some of the awesome features of F# and how they can be teamed up with Monogame to create great games for multiple platforms ranging from iOS to Windows Store."
