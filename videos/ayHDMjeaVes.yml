description: "Most of us know by now that you can rent a server in the cloud to deploy your application. But setting up these servers, keeping them up to date and generally keeping things running can take a lot of time. Time you might instead want to spend on actually building your application.\n\nIn this quickie you will see how to do:\n\n* Zero downtime deployments multiple times per day (No more 3am deployments on a Saturday)\n\n* On fully managed infrastructure (You set things up once, and it will keep running)\n\n* That's redundant and self healing (If it does crash at 4am you can keep sleeping and look at the logs the next day while the application keeps running.)\n\n* Using software based on open standards. (No vender lock-in. You can leave the cloud if you want to.)\n\nWe'll wire together Java, Maven, Flyway, SQL, Docker + container registry, Kubernetes, Load balancers, Git, Jenkins and FluentD to create production ready infrastructure in just under 15 minutes.\n\nConstantijn Visinescu is an all-round IT professional with significant experience in development, design, architecture and consultancy.\n\nConstantijn enjoys working with teams to achieve a high level of quality and productivity.\n\nIn the technical arena, he finds most entertainment in finding simple solutions to hard problems, preferably using light weight architectures and a healthy dose of common sense. He enjoys reasoning about the implications of high level design decisions just as well as the lowest level of implementation detail.\n\n[IYZ-6965]"
