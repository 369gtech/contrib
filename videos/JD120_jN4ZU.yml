It is an ordered back linked-list data structure of blocks of transactions stored in a decentralized peer- to-peer network. It is the underlying infrastructure for bitcoin, a popular cryptocurrency.  In near future, many companies will be adopting blockchain technologies for trading publicly. Apart from bitcoin, it can be used for a wide variety of applications such as tracking ownership, digital assets, physical assets, or voting rights. It can also store and run computer code called ‘smart contracts’.  However, blockchain is still new and the communities are still exploring the best ways in which it can be used. \n\nFor more information, please write back to us at sales@edureka.co\nCall us at US: 1800 275 9730(toll free) or India: +91 88808 62004\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/edurekaIN/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/edurekain\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/edureka"
