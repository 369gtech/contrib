Do we have only one and a half year to migrate to python3? Well… Yes and no. Most people aim for the upgrade. But that doesn’t mean everyone. This talk would be a comprehensive guide for migration from python2 to python3. However, I’ll also talk about projects that cannot be migrated for various reasons. 2020 doesn’t necessarily mean pythonic armageddon. Come and find out."
