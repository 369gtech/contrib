description: 'The battle between native and web rages on. Browsers are fighting hard to tear down the benefits that native developers have relied on since the inception of mobile platforms. One of the greatest draws for native developers has been push notifications, for the web, emails just don''t cut it. Enter the Service Worker. Born out of the struggle to make sites work offline it also brings push notifications to the web. We''ll build an example app live and see how to implement the Service Worker to enhance the user experience with push notifications. The battle continues, but the web is pushing back.'
