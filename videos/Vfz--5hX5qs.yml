recordingDate: 1443105406
description: "Neo4j Spatial is a community supported library designed to help you model geographic data in Neo4j and build applications that make the most of location information in a connected way. In this talk we will introduce you to Neo4j, the concept of a \"graph database\", and why this approach is so well suited to the modern world. We will give you a taste of the various options available for building location aware data applications.\n\nAnd to end off, we will give you a sneak peek at some of the up-coming spatial features planned for future releases of\nNeo4j, which help make it even easier to model location data with high performance.\n\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry in the Malmö/Lund region. Foo Café is aimed at those interested in sharing, learning and creating. \nJoin the fun at foocafe.org"
