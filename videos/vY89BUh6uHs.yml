description: "When you’re trying to improve how your organization does software, how do you change what managers and executives do? We hear a lot about how developers and operators change, the composition of product teams, and always about Kubernetes. But there’s very little conversation about transforming management. This panel of managers will discuss what managers’ and executives’ roles new and old look like, managing managers, and how individual managers can manage their careers when their role changes.\n\nMichael Coté, Staff Technologist at VMware; \nNeville George, Manager at Comcast; \nJon Osborn, IT Executive at Bell Tracy, Ltd.; \nJana Werner, Head of Transformation at Tesco Bank\n\nSlides: Link to come"
