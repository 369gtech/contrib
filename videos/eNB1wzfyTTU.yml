description: "\"Audio Classification with Machine Learning\n[EuroPython 2019 - Talk - 2019-07-11 - Singapore [PyData track]\n[Basel, CH]\n\nBy Jon Nordby\n\nSound is a rich source of information about the world around us.\nModern deep learning approaches can give human-like performance on a range of sound classifiction tasks.\nThis makes it possible to build systems that use sound to for example:\nunderstand speech, to analyze music, to assist in medical diagnostics, detect quality problems in manufacturing, and to study the behavior of animals.\n\nThis talk will show you how to build practical machine learning models that can classify sound.\nWe will convert sound into spectrograms, a visual representation of sound over time,\nand apply machine learning models similar to what is used to for image classification.\nThe focus will be on Convolutional Neural Networks, which have been shown to work very well for this task.\nThe Keras and Tensorflow deep learning frameworks will be used. Some tricks for getting usable results with small amounts of data will be covered, including transfer learning, audio embeddings and data augmentation.\n\nA basic understanding of machine learning is recommended.\nFamiliarity with digital sound is a bonus.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2019.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/"
