title: 'Loek Duys - Running a Real-World, Mission-Critical System on Azure'

description: "DevConf - The Software Craftsmen Festival for Sharing Knowledge and Inspiration (https://devconf.pl/)\n\nDeploying a single container to the Azure is easy; running a mission-critical system is not. To run your ever-changing software reliably, you’ll need to think ahead about a range of things. For example, controlled deployment and testing of not only software but infrastructure as well. How can you use redundancy and cut dependencies to make both infrastructure and software resilient to failure? What do you do to monitor system health? And how do you protect your application’s secrets?\n\nIn this talk ‘from-the-trenches’, I’ll show you what you need to know, using Azure Kubernetes Service, Azure SQL, Application Insights, and more. I’ll explain how we chose to do it, what went wrong and how we fixed it."
