For reactive programming, he uses RxJava and Reactor. For the web stack, he pits Spring MVC vs Spring WebFlux allowing us to move easily between the Servlet and Reactive worlds and drawing a meaningful, apples-to-apples comparison.\n\nThis presentation was recorded at QCon New York 2017. \nThe next QCon is in London, March 5-7, 2018.
