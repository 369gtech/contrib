description: "https://developer.oracle.com/code/online | Luc Bors: Oracle JET hybrid mobile development is almost exactly the same as Oracle JET web development. The Apache Cordova command-line interface and the Oracle JET tooling enables you to setup, build and serve JET hybrid mobile apps in exactly the same way as you would a JET web app.  \n\nThere are definitely mobile specific tasks (such as integrating the camera or GPS) but in general an Oracle JET mobile app is pretty much the same as an Oracle JET web app. The biggest difference is that it is deployed to a mobile device. \n\nIn this session you will learn how to develop a JET mobile app that uses features of Oracle Mobile Cloud service. You will see how to setup JET mobile, how to develop the app and how to combine Oracle JET and Oracle MCS in order to create a great Mobile app."
