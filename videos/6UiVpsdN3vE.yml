description: "Personalized medicine, leading to better and more efficient medicine for many, will advance substantially as datasets combining broad genomic and other molecular data are combined with phenomic data -- rich clinical parameter datasets containing information that clinical decision makers really want to know. Although much attention has been paid to the genomic data, the phenomic data is often the greater challenge. Now progress is being made on both fronts, and these genomic-phenomic datasets have the potential for tremendous innovation in Rx, Dx, and more. Where are these joined datasets emerging from first? What opportunities for innovation do they provide? What may this mean for the future of the personalized medicine ecosystem?\n\nAlexis Borisy\n\nThird Rock Ventures\n\nAlexis Borisy is a successful biotechnology entrepreneur with more than 20 years of experience building and operating innovative science-based organizations.
