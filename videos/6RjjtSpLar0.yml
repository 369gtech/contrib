description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nSpeed Racer: Local Persistent Volumes in Production - Matt Schallert, Chronosphere \n\nLocal Persistent Volumes are a powerful feature of Kubernetes, enabling users to build and operate high-performance stateful systems in their clusters and bridging the storage gap for on-premise users. However, their usage comes with subtle pitfalls that users may not be aware of, and understanding of these aspects is key to a seamless production experience.  In this talk, Matt will share best practices and how-to’s for local volumes based on experience running them in production since their alpha release. He will cover topics such as in-cluster volume provisioning, best practices not obvious from Kubernetes documentation, and cloud provider-specific local disk behavior.  The audience will walk away with a better understanding of the tradeoffs of local volumes and how to leverage them in their workloads, concrete tips for avoiding common mistakes, and day-two operational best practices.\n\nhttps://sched.co/ZenO"
