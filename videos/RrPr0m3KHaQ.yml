description: "Back in the day, large-scale monolithic systems ruled the world. While these systems worked well in their time, we saw them quickly fall apart in the 2000s. But why?\n\nMark Richards discusses the evolution of software architecture and shows how the systems we’ve built so far won’t live up to current social, economic, and technology demands. Mark then outlines the ingredients that go into both evolutionary architecture and competitive advantage, offers a glimpse of what software architecture will look like in the future, and shares the things we software architects need to focus on and think about beyond 2017.\n\nSubscribe to O'Reilly on YouTube: http://goo.gl/n3QSYi\n\nFollow O'Reilly on \nTwitter: http://twitter.com/oreillymedia\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/OReilly\nGoogle: http://plus.google.com/+oreillymedia"
