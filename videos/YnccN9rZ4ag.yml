title: 'Privacy and Big Data: Is there room for privacy in the age of big data?'
recordingDate: 1316217932
description: "We all know that digital data is increasing at an exponential rate driven by all the devices we use, ubiquitous networks, social media, and emerging technologies like the Internet of Things. But what is not well understood is how the components of big data, in the form of cheap storage, increased CPU power, and new algorithms, have changed the privacy landscape. Today, the aggregation and analysis of data is commonplace. Predictive models are used to predict your buying behavior or flag you as a possible criminal or terrorist. In this webcast, Terence Craig and Mary Ludloff, authors of Privacy and Big Data, ask and answer this question: What level of privacy do you really have in the age of big data? Get their take on the privacy debate from a number of different perspectives:\n\nThe surprising ways that data is collected and used.\nThe main privacy players and the business models that drive them.\nSome approaches to maintaining your privacy and their effectiveness.\n\nJoin Terence and Mary as they consider whether the big data age has ended privacy as we know it.\n\nAbout Terence Craig:\nTerence is CEO and CTO of PatternBuilders, a Big Data Analytics solutions and services company. He has an extensive background in building, implementing, and selling analytically-driven enterprise applications across such diverse domains as enterprise resource planning (ERP), professional services automation (PSA), and semi-conductor process control and analytics in both public and private companies. With over 20 years of experience in both executive and technical management roles with leading-edge private and public technology companies, Terence brings a unique and innovative view of what is needed-from both an operational and technology perspective-to build a world class analytics platform that is focused on the innovative development of analytic applications designed to improve companies' and organizations' profitability and efficiencies. \n\nTerence is also a speaker, blogger (on all things big data and analytics plus lots of other stuff), and co-author of \"Privacy and Big Data.\" Never shy to share his opinion, Terence had this to say during a round table discussion at pii2011 about big data information collection that was used to break down the door of an innocent family: \"It used to be that it took weeks to accumulate that data. Now technology allows stupid people to be stupid much faster.\" (T-Shirts are in the works and will be available for purchase soon).\n\nAbout Mary Ludloff:\nMary is the VP of marketing for PatternBuilders, a Big Data Analytics solutions and services company. She is an innovative executive with more than 20 years of experience in the high tech industry. When it comes to marketing she has, in her own words, \"been there, done that and often, with little or no budget.\" Our translation: Mary understands how to develop and implement strategic program initiatives that span marketing disciplines-ranging from the traditional corporate and marketing fields to the latest developments in digital marketing (yes, much more descriptive and far less interesting than her own words). \n\nThrough her work at Brio Technology (now Hyperion) and NONSTOP Solutions (now Manhattan Associates), Mary also brings a deep understanding of supply chain management issues as well as the use of business intelligence tools in data warehousing and analytic application efforts. Mary is co-author of \"Privacy and Big Data,\" a frequent white paper contributor, an editor of many reference manuals, user manuals, and other publications, and a blogger on diverse topics such as big data and analytics from a technology and business perspective, data security, data privacy, and marketing in the digital age."
