description: "RubyConf 2019 - mruby/c: Running on Less Than 64KB RAM Microcontroller by HAMUSI Hitoshi\n\nI will show you an actual IoT product which uses one-chip-microcontroller-based hardwares for a Japanese Sake Brewery. Brewing Sake requires workers to take temperature of the ingredients very frequently. mruby/c is a small implementation of Ruby and runs on microcontroller which has less than 64KB RAM. You will see a new Ruby World.\n\n#confreaks #rubyconf2019"
