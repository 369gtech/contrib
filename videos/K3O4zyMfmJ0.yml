description: "Google I/O 2010 - Google Charts Toolkit: Google's new unified approach for creating dynamic charts on the web \r\n\r\nGoogle APIs 201 \r\n\r\nMichael Fink, Amit Weinstein \r\n\r\nGoogle Charts Toolkit is Google's unified approach for creating charts on the web. It provides a rich gallery spanning from pie charts to interactive heat-maps and from organizational trees to motion charts. The toolkit lets developers choose between JavaScript based client-side rendering and image based server-side rendering. We will present the relative strengths of these two approaches, and unveil the future visual design of Google Charts.  \r\n\r\nFor all I/O 2010 sessions, please go to http://code.google.com/events/io/2010/sessions.html"
