description: "Technical track breakout session presented by Elisabeth Hendrickson, Pivotal.\n\nWith continuous delivery, you release frequently and with very little, or no, manual intervention. That requires three things: fully automated tests; a continuous integration server that executes those tests and can promote successful deployments; and an automated deployment mechanism with zero downtime. PaaS's are a perfect fit for this. Cloud Foundry makes zero-downtime automated deployments straightforward. Further, cloud-based CI services such as Cloudbees work well with Cloud Foundry. In this talk, Elisabeth explains how to achieve continuous delivery with Cloud Foundry using one of our own applications (docs.cloudfoundry.org) as an example."
