description: "In this video i'm going to cover a decentralized data exchange called DataWallet. It' allows users to earn a passive income from their data by getting rewarded either via a network token (DXT) or via personalized services. Users complete ownership over their own data, while giving developers and data consumers access to a marketplace for high-quality data.\n\nCode for this video: \nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/datawallet\n\nPlease Subscribe!
