description: "\"We're gonna talk about emulating game consoles with JavaScript.\nInitially, we look at the Chip-8 system which is a basic system to emulate. After that, we will do a bit of a Nintendo Famicom (NES) tear down and how to build the components with JavaScript.\"\n\nAlex is a front end web developer living in Sydney, Australia and working for Atlassian. He enjoys tinkering with computer software and hardware, and especially where they converge. When there is time to spare, he enjoys exploring the outdoors and drumming. \n\nJSConf.Asia is the JavaScript, web and mobile developer conference for Asia. Hotel H2O and Manila Ocean Park, Philippines - 28 + 29 November 2013.\n\nSource: http://2013.jsconf.asia/blog/2013/10/16/jsconfasia-2013-alex-dickson-emulating-with-javascript\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
