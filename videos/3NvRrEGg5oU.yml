description: "Building Resilience: How to Learn More from Incidents\n\nNick Stenning, Microsoft\n\nLearning from incidents: it's not as easy as it sounds! Research from numerous safety-critical industries (aviation! healthcare! firefighting!) is changing what we know about how to build resilient systems and organizations in a turbulent world. This talk is going to share some of that research with you in a direct and practically-applicable way.\n\nOne major obstacle to building resilience in an engineering organization is the traditional approach to post-incident review, which focuses heavily on incident prevention. Come and learn:\n\n1. that there is and always will be more to incident response and review than prevention,\n2. how to recognize and avoid four common traps during incident investigations, and\n3. when to apply four concrete recommendations on how to learn more from incidents in your organization.\n\nView the full SREcon19 Europe/Middle East/Africa Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon19emea/program \n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
