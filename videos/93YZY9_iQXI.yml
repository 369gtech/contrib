title: 'DrupalCon Baltimore 2017: The Cure for Translation Headaches'
recordingDate: 1493214614
description: "Before choosing Lingotek, HID Global was experiencing major translation headaches. They found an agency that was integrated with Drupal, but the quality of translation was poor. They had another vendor that provided quality translation, but didn’t have an integration with Drupal.\_\n\nHID Global needed a translation solution that solved both -- the integration problem and the quality concerns. In addition, the HID Global team was plagued by too many manual processes that required copying and pasting content from Drupal into documents and then having to manually send those documents for translation. The more content types they added, the more complex and time-consuming the translation process became for HID Global content managers.\n\nJoin us for this informative session to learn how the integrated translation solution provided by the Lingotek - Inside Drupal Module quickly eliminated the company’s translation pains. Discover how integrating translation inside Drupal had a positive business impact on the speed, accuracy, and quality of HID Global’s translations and helped free up time for their content managers and developers.\_\n\nWhat level of knowledge should attendees have before walking into your session?\nThis session is for attendees who are using Drupal 7 or Drupal 8 or those who want to learn more about Drupal translation integrations.
