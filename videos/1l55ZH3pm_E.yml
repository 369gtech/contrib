This talk puts together my experience testing in production a large scale system that affects millions of users. Experience, ideas, limits, roadblocks, tips and more.\n\nJorge Mar√≠n is an engineer passionate about robotics, automation, statistics and mountains. With a degree on Telecommunications Engineering he tried to help drones to navigate indoors where GPS position is not available or inaccurate. Got dragged to `the cloud` afterwards and has been working since then automating the hell of anything he touches. Currently he is taking over Dyson's testing strategy for cloud services."
