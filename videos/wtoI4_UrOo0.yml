title: 'R for Data Science – Exploring the Tidyverse - Olof Rännbäck Garpinger'
recordingDate: 1526554741
description: "R is a programming language and free software environment used by companies such as Google, Microsoft, and New York Times. The Tidyverse is a collection of R packages for Data Science, based on a common ground of data and R programming. These packages can be used to: import, tidy, transform, visualize, model, and communicate, data.\n\nThe Tidyverse is immensely popular among Data Science practitioners using R. Thanks to the book ”R for Data Science”, by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund, it is easy for programmers to dive into the Tidyverse. The main purposes of this seminar are to show some of the key features of the Tidyverse and inspire people to learn more about it. We will go through key features of libraries such as ggplot2 (visualization), dplyr (manipulation), and readr (import), using data from the Swedish ski race Vasaloppet. \n\nOlof Rännbäck Garpinger has a PhD in Automatic Control from Lund University, and has worked as a consultant since 2009. He has long experience in data analysis using both R and Matlab, and is an avid fan of the Tidyverse.\n________________________\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry.
