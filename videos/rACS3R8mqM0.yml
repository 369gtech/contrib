More talks on https://dotconferences.com/talks\n\nBefore being a web developer, we are all users of the internet which is a jungle of UX patterns, some bad, some good and some terrible. Sara explores the complex paths of this jungle to understand together how we can plan and develop ways to make our applications be a more enjoyable experience for both our users and us."
