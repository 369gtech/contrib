title: 'YOW! 2016 Jon Manning - How Do I Game Design? Design Games, Understand People!'
recordingDate: 1494825810
description: "In this session, you’ll learn about game design: the art and science of constructing enjoyable, engaging games. We aren’t doing any coding, and we’re not talking game engine development – instead, we’ll be taking a deep dive into game design theory, using it to understand how people interact with rules, and how to use it to improve your community, your company, your project, and your software.\n\nVideo games are the most glamorous of the electronic arts, but splashy graphics and amazing sound aren’t the defining feature of games. Games are the world’s only interactive artistic medium, and good interaction needs to be designed. Today’s master crafters of interaction design are game designers.\n\nIn this session, you’ll get a fresh perspective on user experience design and community engagement by understanding how people are interacting with the fastest-growing form of entertainment in the world.\n\nTopics covered in this session include:\n\n* Why games work, and how to analyse and build engaging experiences\n* The Mechanics-Dynamics-Aesthetics framework: what it’s good for, and how to use it\n* How to understand what a game’s doing, and how to build for fun\n\nWe’ll take this knowledge and apply it to real world examples in the realms of UX and UI design, community management, project management, and company building, as well as a few examples from the actual game development industry.\n\nJon Manning is a co-founder of Secret Lab, where he makes games and does research. He has an actual PhD about jerks on the internet, has written about a dozen technical books for O’Reilly Media, and wrote two games for ABC’s Play School and one for Qantas. He’s currently working on Button Squid, a top-down puzzler for iOS, and is fond of making cool tools for rad devs.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
