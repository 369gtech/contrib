title: 'GeeCON 2019: Adam Warski - From annotations to code: describing HTTP endpoints with Tapir'
recordingDate: 1563984102
description: 'Most of the popular Java frameworks are annotation driven. But while annotations have been a great tool, today we are no longer constrained by what''s possible in Java 5. Functional programming has been re-discovered, and the JVM has a rich ecosystem of languages. In the talk we''ll first review some of the problems of annotations. However, most of the time will be dedicated to a **live-coding** case study, replacing HTTP endpoint mapping annotations with Scala code, using the [Tapir](https://github.com/softwaremill/tapir) library. Separating the descriptions of mappings or side-effects, from the interpretation, using ''regular'' programming language constructs is a powerful tool: we have all the flexibility of the base language at our disposal. But, let the code from this talk speak for itself!'
