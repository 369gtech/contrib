description: "If great software is secure software, why are there still so many vulnerabilities? Donâ€™t architects and developers want to build great systems? Software teams today must move fast to compete in the marketplace. They need to inherit functionality, scale, and performance. Can they inherit security as well?\n\nAs defenders it is our job to make this inheritance possible. Ideally security inheritance is transparent and inescapable. Chris Wysopal details how defenders can enable developers to create secure software through coaching, shared code, and services.\n\nSubscribe to O'Reilly on YouTube: http://goo.gl/n3QSYi\n\nFollow O'Reilly on: \nTwitter: http://twitter.com/oreillymedia\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/OReilly\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/oreillymedia\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/8459/"
