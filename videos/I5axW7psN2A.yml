description: 'The need to run virtual machines is diminishing as more companies move to a container first strategy for applications. With combined technologies to control infrastructure and orchestration, now is the time to return to bare-metal servers and banish costly snowflake deployments with immutable infrastructure. If youâ€™ve ever dreamed of running your own bare-metal infrastructure come learn how an open source project that provides vendor-agnostic automation of servers, integrates into InfraKit to provide bare-metal consumption from native toolsets ready to run containers.'
