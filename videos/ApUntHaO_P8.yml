description: "Working on a Django app that interacts with Facebook, twitter, or any other social media? Getting your butt kicked by unpublished rate limits? In this pre-DjangoCon 2012 talk for the SF Django Meetup, David Gouldin, Software Engineer at Votizen, goes over how Celery's asynchronous task organization can keep you from constantly beating your head against the inivisible 3rd party rate-limit wall.\n\nWhen you're done, check out Marakana instructor Simeon Franklin's tutorial on Asynchronous tasks with Django and Celery to get a head start on integrating Celery into your app here: http://marakana.com/s/asynchronous_tasks_with_django_and_celery,1164/index.html"
