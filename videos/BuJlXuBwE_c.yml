recordingDate: 1494243654
description: "Do you think that you should use microservices in your next project, but are afraid of complexity and infrastructure issues? Do you want to find a middle ground between flexibility of system architecture and speed of development? If yes, then this talk is for you! We will go through micromodule architecture, which is pioneered in FinoTech.\nWe will go through how to combine benefits of both micro services and monolith worlds in one shot."
