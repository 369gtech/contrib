This is a 10-Module Instructor led Online Course.\n2. We have a 3-hour Live and Interactive Sessions every Sunday.\n\n3. We have 4 hours of Practical Work involving Lab Assignments, Case Studies and Projects every week which can be done at your own pace. We can also provide you Remote Access to Our Hadoop Cluster for doing Practicals.\n\n4. We have a 24x7 One-on-One LIVE Technical Support to help you with any problems you might face or any clarifications you may require during the course.\n\n5. At the end of the training you will have to undergo a 2-hour LIVE Practical Exam based on which we will provide you a Grade and a Verifiable Certificate!\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - \nAbout the Course\n\nBig Data and Hadoop training course is designed to provide knowledge and skills to become a successful Hadoop Developer. In-depth knowledge of concepts such as Hadoop Distributed File System, Setting up the Hadoop Cluster, MapReduce, Advance MapReduce, PIG, HIVE, HBase, Zookeeper, SQOOP, Hadoop 2.0 , YARN etc. will be covered in the course.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - \nCourse Objectives\n\nAfter the completion of the Hadoop Course at Edureka, you should be able to: Master the concepts of Hadoop Distributed File System. Understand Cluster Setup and Installation. Understand MapReduce and Functional programming. Understand How Pig is tightly coupled with Map-Reduce. Learn how to use Hive, How you can load data into HIVE and query data from Hive. Implement HBase, MapReduce Integration, Advanced Usage and Advanced Indexing. Have a good understanding of ZooKeeper service and Sqoop, Hadoop 2.0, YARN, etc. Develop a working Hadoop Architecture.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - \nWho should go for this course?\n\n\nThis course is designed for developers with some programming experience (preferably Java) who are looking forward to acquire a solid foundation of Hadoop Architecture. Existing knowledge of Hadoop is not required for this course.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - \nWhy Learn Hadoop?\n\n\nBiG Data! A Worldwide Problem?\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, \"Big data is collection of data sets so large and complex that it becomes difficult to process using on-hand database management tools or traditional data processing applications.\" In simpler terms, Big Data is a term given to large volumes of data that organizations store and process. However, It is becoming very difficult for companies to store, retrieve and process the ever-increasing data. If any company gets hold on managing its data well, nothing can stop it from becoming the next BIG success!\n\nThe problem lies in the use of traditional systems to store enormous data. Though these systems were a success a few years ago, with increasing amount and complexity of data, these are soon becoming obsolete. The good news is - Hadoop, which is not less than a panacea for all those companies working with BIG DATA in a variety of applications and has become an integral part for storing, handling, evaluating and retrieving hundreds of terabytes, and even petabytes of data.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - \nSome of the top companies using Hadoop: \n\n\nThe importance of Hadoop is evident from the fact that there are many global MNCs that are using Hadoop and consider it as an integral part of their functioning, such as companies like Yahoo and Facebook! On February 19, 2008, Yahoo! Inc. established the world's largest Hadoop production application. The Yahoo! Search Webmap is a Hadoop application that runs on over 10,000 core Linux cluster and generates data that is now widely used in every Yahoo! Web search query.\n\n\nOpportunities for Hadoopers!\n\nOpportunities for Hadoopers are infinite - from a Hadoop Developer, to a Hadoop Tester or a Hadoop Architect, and so on. If cracking and managing BIG Data is your passion in life, then think no more and Join Edureka's Hadoop Online course and carve a niche for yourself! Happy Hadooping!\n\n\nPlease write back to us at hadoopsales@edureka.co or call us at +91-8880862004 for more information. \nhttp://www.edureka.co/big-data-and-hadoop"
