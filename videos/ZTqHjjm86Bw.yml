description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2016\n—\nOne of the most interesting new features being proposed for C++ standardization is coroutines, formerly known as “resumable functions”. C++ coroutines are designed to be highly scalable, highly efficient (no overhead), and highly extensible, while still interacting seamlessly with the rest of the C++ language.\n\nThis session will consist of an in-depth introduction to C++ coroutines. We will begin by looking at the rationale for adding coroutines to the C++ language. We will then demonstrate and explain a sequence of coroutines that gradually introduce the features of C++ coroutines. This part of the talk will show both how to write various forms of coroutines and also how the coroutines extensibility model enables existing libraries to be non-invasively adapted to work with C++ coroutines.\n— \nJames McNellis\nSenior Software Engineer, Microsoft Visual C++\nJames McNellis is a senior engineer on the Visual C++ team at Microsoft, where he works on C++ library design and is responsible for the Microsoft C Runtime (CRT) and C Standard Library implementation.
