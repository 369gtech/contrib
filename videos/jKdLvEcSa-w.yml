description: "Erlang Solutions, and Tutuka invite you to join Rudolph Van Graan (Senior Consultant and Payment System Specialist at Erlang Solutions) & Shaun Hodgkiss (Technical Director at Tutuka) for an insightful discussion on how you can implement a highly scalable payment switch. \nErlang Solutions has provided the essential expertise in building hugely scalable payment switches and continues to provide support for these services. Tutuka is a leader in the provision of prepaid cards with experience in building Erlang-powered payment systems.\n\nAs transaction volume continues to increase, performance and scalability become critical. Ability to acquire, authenticate and authorize large volumes of financial transactions across multiple channels is a must.\n\nErlang programming language was designed specifically for writing scalable, fault-tolerant, distributed, non-stop, soft real-time applications. This makes it well suited for building financial switches. With its built-in efficiency, Erlang provides rapid development and low cost implementation.\n\nIn this webinar, you'll learn:\n\n    How Erlang helps developing robust, scalable yet flexible payment and transaction systems?\n    How to simplify implementation and deployment of an Erlang transaction system on both low cost and expensive hardware?\n    How ESL helped a specialist payment partner deliver a new generation of payment switch while reducing the overall cost of the solution?\n    Business & technological challenges of 'Tutuka' (a software company focused on prepaid technology and the largest and longest running voucher system provider in South Africa) & how Erlang based switch helped in overcoming it."
