description: "Building software products is an expensive, confusing and error prone process (even for developers!). Finding available developers is an ongoing resource constraint. Many solve these problems by trying to define as much of their product up front, and hand near-finished specifications to developers.\n\nYet in 2015, it is faster to iteratively prototype with software (we like Ember.js). Prototypes avoid costly errors and mistakes in the software process (i.e. “I thought users needed an email to register”) due to late proof of concepts, and are generally cheaper than the traditional process. When written correctly, prototypes are not a separate task but instead evolve into a production-ready state.\n\nAlexander Blom\nPartner, Isle of Code\nhttps://twitter.com/alexblom\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/alexblom\nhttps://github.com/AlexBlom/\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
