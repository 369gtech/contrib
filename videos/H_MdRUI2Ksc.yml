title: 'Vault and Security as a Service - Patrick Shields | The Lead Developer Austin 2018'

description: 'Over the past ten years, we’ve seen a dramatic shift in the architecture of service-oriented systems. We now build our applications on top of polyglot persistence, micro-services, and cluster management, but most of us have not adapted our security practices in the face of these changes. We check private keys into source control. We bake database passwords into VMs or Docker images. We have no idea who is deploying anything. Enter Vault: an open source tool for managing security for the complex operational environments of today. In this talk, I’ll explain what Vault is and its key features. We’ll go on to talk a bit about how Vault fits into a modern architecture and how to iteratively introduce it or a similar secrets provider into your organization.'
