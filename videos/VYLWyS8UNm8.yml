title: 'YOW! 2017 Kresten Krab Thorup - All the Things We Didn’t Do'

description: "Humio is a startup on a mission to democratise log analytics. With limited resources, being successful is just as much about avoiding bad decisions, as it is about doing things right. This is a talk about trade-offs, technology and culture in building a startup.\n\nWorking with log data introduces quite a different set of assumptions about how a data store should operate: you store a lot of data without known which part of it is relevant, and then after an incident, you want to be able to search it. Our biggest customers only look at 1% of the data they store. This is the opposite of how normal datastores operate: spend resources at ingest to make data easy to find. So we didn’t do it that way.\n\nKresten provides technical leadership and vision at Humio. In his previous role as CTO of Trifork, Kresten was responsible for technical strategy and has provided consulting advice to teams on a variety of technologies to include distributed systems and databases, erlang, Java, and mobile application development. Kresten has been a contributor to several open source projects, including GCC, GNU Objective-C, GNU Compiled Java, Emacs, and Apache Geronimo/Yoko. Prior to Trifork, Kresten worked at NeXT Software (now acquired by Apple), where he was responsible for the development of the Objective-C tool chain, the debugger, and the runtime system. Kresten has a Ph.D. in computer science from University of Aarhus.\n\nFor more on YOW! conferences, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
