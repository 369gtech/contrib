description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2018\n—\nOn Linux systems, compiled C++ code is generally bundled in the ELF binary \nformat. This talk walks through several details of the format that can help a \nC++ developper to better understand the whole compilation chain, from classical \ntext and data sections through symbol tables down to init_array, eh_frame. \n\nThe talk walks though all the sections of a binary compiled from a simple C++ \ncode and explain the links between c++ concepts like constant global variables, \nexceptions, global constructors, ODR, symbol visibility, thread local variables \nand related binary artefacts. \n\nAll these aspects will be demonstrated on a live demo using the output of the \nvenerable objdump and readelf commands.\n— \nSerge Guelton, Software Engineer, Quarkslab\n\nSerge « sans paille » Guelton is a compiler engineer at QuarksLab where he builds an LLVM-based code obfuscator. He's also the maintainer of the Pythran compiler that turns scientific Python kernels into efficient C++ code.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
