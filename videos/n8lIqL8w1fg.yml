description: "Holden Karau is a software development engineer at IBM’s Spark Technology Center, author, and active open source contributor.\n \nIn her LX Scala talk, Holden discusses Spark ML's sci-kit learning inspired pipeline API gives you the ability to easily construct complex machine learning workflows and experiment (including hyper tuning of model parameters). To be able to experiment with your own models, you will need to understand how the ML pipeline API works and implement your own model. Even if implementing your own model isn't your cup of tea this talk will give you a greater understanding of how Spark ML's internals work.\n \nFind out more at http://www.spark.tc/ and follow Holden at: https://twitter.com/holdenkarau\n \nAbout LX Scala:\n \nLX Scala 2017 was held May 11-12th in Lisbon, Portugal. With over 9 speakers, 160 attendees, and plenty of networking, the 2nd LX Scala was a great success. \n \nThanks to co-organizers e.near and codacy and the support of the Scala User Groups of Portugal, Madrid, Málaga, and Barcelona.\n \nSpecial thanks to our awesome sponsors Lightbend, ThoughtWorks, Equal Experts, and ScalaC. \n \nFind out more at http://www.lxscala.com/ and https://www.47deg.com and follow us https://www.twitter.com/lx_scala and https://www.twitter.com/47deg to stay up-to-date with all the latest in functional programming."
