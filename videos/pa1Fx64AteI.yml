description: "TypeScript adds optional static typing and “future JavaScript” transpilation, with the recent 2.0 version adding many features for convenient usage and large-scale projects. In this session we show how TypeScript 2.0, alongside tooling, can boost your productivity:\n\n* Catch errors early by letting your tooling help you “fail sooner\"\n\n* Encode the producer-consumer contract in a lightweight, executable format\n\n* Develop web frontend apps with the latest JavaScript features\n\nIn this talk, we’ll show TypeScript with WebStorm, a modern IDE that puts TypeScript to work, in the context of an Angular 2 application.\n\nPaul is the PyCharm/WebStorm Developer Advocate at JetBrains. Before that, Paul was a co-founder of Zope Corporation, taking the first open source application server through $14M of funding. Paul has bootstrapped both the PSF and the Plone Foundation. Before that, Paul was an officer in the US Navy, starting www.navy.mil in 1993."
