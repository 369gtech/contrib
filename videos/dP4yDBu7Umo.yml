description: "It’s a tech jungle out there. People are struggling to figure out a suitable infrastructure deployment model for their individual use case all the while trying to withstand the noise of enterprises, providers and the tech bohemia telling them what the latest greatest way of doing things has to look like. Focusing on your actual demands and finding a deployment model that properly fits your pockets, waist and shoulders is actually hard.\n\nThis talk picks up popular infrastructure deployment models and maps them to current architecture models. What’s the better deal, building your own physical data center or climbing the abstraction ladder by using IaaS, PaaS or even Serverless? We will look at pros and cons and discuss cases where either model makes sense.\n\nWe will also discuss your role in the jungle and what you need to bring to the table even if you were trying to buy everything “off the shelf”."
