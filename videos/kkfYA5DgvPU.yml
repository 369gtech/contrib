description: "Speaker: Woody Zuill (@WoodyZuill), Agile Guide, Trainer, Developer @ Zuill Development\n\nThe strength of Agile lies in the simplicity and clarity of the Values and Principles expressed in the Agile Manifesto. It can empower the people doing software development in any organization, and enable us to make rapid strides to the \"land of better\".\n\nSoftware development is an activity of discovery. We must take action to reveal the reality of the problem at hand, the elements of the solution, and to reveal the work that is needed to design and create the software required. This is the process of discovery.\n\nAs leaders, activators, and influencers of change in the companies we work with, it's up to us to understand the philosophy of Agile and how it embraces and empowers the process of discovery.\n\nI'll share my thinking about \"Pure Agile\", and how I use it in my daily work to enhance Continuous Discovery, Learning, and Growth in the teams and companies I work with. Let's explore together and discover the path to the future we want to create.\n\nAbout the speaker\n\nWoody Zuill is an independent Agile Guide and Coach and has been programming computers for 30+ years. He is a pioneer of the Mob Programming approach to teamwork in software development, and is considered one of the founders of the \"#NoEstimates\" discussion on Twitter.  His passion is to work with teams to create an environment where everyone of us can excel in our work and in their lives.\n\nEvent Page: http://2016.agilesingapore.org\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/XvTF/"
