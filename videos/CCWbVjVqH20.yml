recordingDate: 1573074628
description: "Through the advent of 5G and the evolution in Internet of Things systems we see an explosion in use cases of Edge computing. Technology now allows for complex computing like machine learning on the edge. This of course provides new challenges for developers in how to develop, maintain and manage these solutions.\n\nIn this session we will look at how you can setup a Kubernetes based devops solution for developing these complex applications consisting of components which run on a mixture of central cloud systems and edge devices.\n\nWe will show also how you can manage a setup with large number of edge devices and control aspects like security and integrity. The use case will show how we can develop using some basic hardware (raspberry or other ARM based computing devices) solutions like visual recognition to run on the edge in real time fashion on a multitude of devices.\n\nWe will be leveraging the open source Horizon software.\n\nEric Cattoir:\nDuring a 25 year career at IBM Eric was involved with many customer projects of various sizes. He has a long experience in all kind of development related technologies, ranging from Mainframe environments till mobile and internet of things. He has been involved in  aspects of modernizing existing environments as well as in implementing new technologies. He has experience both with deep down development, but also with methodology, architecture and change consultancy.\n\nCurrently he is a consultant within the IBM Hybrid Cloud  where amongst others he is helping customers deciding on the right deployment solution for their applications in a hybrid cloud world.\n\nDennis Lauwers:\nDennis Lauwers is the Distinguished Engineer for Hybrid cloud in Europe, focusing on client leadership. He has been bringing new technologies to the market, making Europe a leading geography within IBM for hybrid cloud solutions. His impact stems from his keen ability to position and explain complex solutions clearly at all levels of a client's organization - business strategy discussions down to hands-on demonstrations. At the same time, he is a vocal advocate for customers, sharing his insights to influence product roadmaps and go-to-market strategies. He has built a strong reputation with the IBM technical community through the creation of solution point of views, architectural assets, enablement material and a community of practice across business units.\nDennis joined IBM in 1997 and had different positions within IBM: support, system engineer, application & integration architect, ISV architect, client trusted advisor, European Technical leader and today Distinguished Engineer.\nDomains of expertise: hybrid cloud solutions, edge computing, solution architecture\nDomains of interest: Quantum computing, cloud technologies, application modernization"
