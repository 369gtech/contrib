description: "Service Meshes are receiving a significant amount of attention. However, even experienced software engineers struggle to reason about Service Meshes end-to-end. Apparently, simple questions like “What is a Service Mesh?” or “What is a Service for?” for that matter, are surprisingly hard to answer. Using a systems modeling approach, this webinar will untangle a mesh of questions: We will deep dive into distributed systems, services, and service meshes and provide accurate and concise answers to questions like “What is a Service Mesh?”, “What does a Service Mesh do?”, and “How does a Service Mesh work?”. Finally we will take a closer look at the popular CNCF Service Mesh Linkerd and explore its architecture. If you still have some unanswered questions around Service Meshes, you do not want to miss this webinar.\n\nPresenter:\n\nDominik Tornow, Principal Engineer @Cisco"
