title: 'CON3123 - How to Build an IDE/Code Editor with JavaFX'
language: English
recordingDate: 1450130100
description: "JavaFX is the future standard toolkit for UI development in Java, but todayâ€™s IDEs are written with legacy toolkits such as Swing (NetBeans, IntelliJ IDEA) or SWT (Eclipse). Is it possible to develop a code editor/IDE with JavaFX that looks slick and performs well? The answer is definitely yes, and this session shows how BestSolution managed to develop a lightweight IDE. The good thing is that most of the components the company developed can be used outside the lightweight IDE, which is built on top of an e(fx)clipse runtime that is built on top of OSGi. So, no matter if your JavaFX app uses OSGi or not, you can make use of this stuff.\n\nSpeaker:\nTom Schindl, CTO, BestSolution.at\nTom Schindl is an Austrian Java Software developer working on Eclipse projects like the Eclipse Platform [*] and the JavaFX integration named e(fx)clipse [**]. He is CTO of BestSolution.at a company specialized in Eclipse and JavaFX consulting for companies around the world. * https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/ ** https://www.eclipse.org/efxclipse"
