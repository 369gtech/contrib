It is present everywhere. It really doesn't matter which domain you are working in, you will surely come across Java sooner or later!\n\nOpen Source: The good news is that Java is available for free! All the development tools and the environment (JRE & JDK) that is used to develop Java applications are absolutely free of cost.\n\nHadoop: Hadoop is one of the most trending framework for processing Big Data. It has been designed and developed in Java.\n\nIn spite of having a tough competition on the server side from Microsoft and other companies, Java is doing extremely well on mobile platforms, thanks to Android!
