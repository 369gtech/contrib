description: "Code Mesh London is the best place in Europe for non-mainstream tech and programming languages. On 4-5 December 2013 over 50 inventors and originators of the most innovative languages and technologies of the moment shared their experience with 200 attendees. Topics included Scala, Haskell, Clojure, Erlang, Elixir, Julia and much more. See you at Code Mesh 2014! codemesh.io/\n\nAbout the talk:\nIdris is an experimental functional programming language with full spectrum dependent types, meaning that types can be predicated on any value. Its syntax is influenced by Haskell. As well as full dependent types it supports records, type classes, tactic based theorem proving, totality checking, and an optimising compiler with a foreign function interface. One of the goals of the Idris project is to bring type-based program verification techniques to programming practitioners while still supporting efficient systems programming via an optimising compiler and interaction with external libraries.\n\nTalk objectives:\n\n- The main objective is to explain why software correctness, particularly non-functional correctness, is important, and show how modern expressive type systems can support this without imposing too much burden on application developers.\nTarget audience:\n\n- Practitioners interested in verification of non-functional properties (particularly resource usage such as files, memory, network protocols, etc). Familiarity with a functional programming language such as Haskell or F# will be useful, but will not be assumed."
