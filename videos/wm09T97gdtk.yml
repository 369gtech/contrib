title: 'DrupalCon New Orleans 2016: Learning to Let Go (Contrib Burnout) and Module Giveaway'
recordingDate: 1463006013
description: "How can someone deeply involved in the Drupal contributed module ecosystem start to step away? How do we handle burnout not just in Drupal core development, but in contrib? I'd like to engage a conversation based the challenges I have encountered and currently face personally/emotionally on my journey from being one of the top contributors to Drupal 7, prolific writer of modules, to someone starting a family and needing to rebalance their personal, work, and Drupal life. With so much focus on getting people involved in Drupal.org, are there technical solutions we can explore to help make active contributors happier?\n\nI also might be giving away commit access to some modules, must be present to win."
