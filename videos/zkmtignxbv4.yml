description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nStill Writing SQL Migrations? You Could Use A (Schema)Hero. - Marc Campbell, Replicated \n\nLet’s talk about database schema migrations. All too often, migrations are deployed using legacy tools, or worse yet — (gasp!) manually. That’s because we write migrations the hard way, instead of simply declaring the desired state of the database. Kubernetes has proved that declarative desired state is a great idea, so why not build on top of the Kubernetes API to let the computers figure out how to write database migrations?  SchemaHero is an open source Kubernetes CRD/Operator that solves database migrations. Want to add an index, or rename a column? Just kubectl apply the desired definition of a table, and the operator will take over by writing and deploying a migration.  Once you stop trying to control the database and just declare the desired state, database migrations are no longer toil, but become predictable and reliable. Let the computers migrate your schema instead.\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zelq"
