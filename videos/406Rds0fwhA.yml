language: English
recordingDate: 1510303651
description: "Blockchain, a completely new architecture for business. Its shared ledger technology establishes trust and transparency, whenever valuable assets are transferred from one party to another. You know for certain that a record — anything from a proof of identity or ownership, to the terms of a business agreement — is unique and unchangeable by any party without the agreement of all parties. With Hyperledger Fabric v1 the promise and potential of Blockchain is becoming more and more reality. In this session, we explore the capabilities of Hyperledger Fabric and we’ll discuss how applications can be built.\n\n# Eric Cattoir\nDuring a 20 year career at IBM Eric was involved with many customer projects of various sizes.
