description: "This video introduces \"Session 8: Building an API in Node\" from the ITP course \"Programming from A to Z\". (http://shiffman.net/a2z/node-api/)\n\nIn this session, I cover the basic steps for building a RESTful API with Node.js.  I show you how to install the Node.js framework express how to use routes and parameters to deal with the HTTP GET requests. I also cover what it means for an API to be a REST (Representational State Transfer) API.\n\n\nNext video: https://youtu.be/6oiabY1xpBo\n\nTo know more on this subject, visit my material on Server-side Programming and Node: http://shiffman.net/a2z/server-node/\n\nCourse url: http://shiffman.net/a2z/\n\nSupport this channel on Patreon: https://patreon.com/codingtrain\n\nSend me your questions and coding challenges!: https://github.com/CodingTrain/Rainbow-Topics\n\nContact: https://twitter.com/shiffman\n\nGitHub Repo with all the info for Programming from A to Z: https://github.com/shiffman/A2Z-F16\n\nLinks discussed in this session:\nNode.js: https://nodejs.org/\nExpress.js: http://expressjs.com/\nRepresentational state transfer on Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer\n \nSource Code for the all Video Lessons: https://github.com/CodingTrain/Rainbow-Code\n\np5.js: https://p5js.org/\nProcessing: https://processing.org\n\nFor More Programming from A to Z videos: https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman/playlists?shelf_id=11&view=50&sort=dd\n\nFor More Coding Challenges: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZiZxtDDRCi6uhfTH4FilpH\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/Z51J/"
