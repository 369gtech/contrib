We started with a set of Ansible scripts and Docker containers. To simplify it we use TeamCity build configurations with many parameters. It took several hours to roll a new build or maintain the system. No matter green-blue deployment was used.\n\nIt was timely to maintain. And I decided to make it faster. Now all deployments run by itself automatically in the night, the versions are stored in Consul. The system is resilient.\n\nJoin me to know more of easy steps we did to reduce the toil.\n\nEugene Petrenko From JetBrains\nEugene is a software developer, Ph.D., speaker, and blogger.
