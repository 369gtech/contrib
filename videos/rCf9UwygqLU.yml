recordingDate: 1532330827
description: "Elasticsearch is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine built on top of Apache Lucene. After the initial release in 2010 it has become the most widely used full-text search engine, but it is not stopping there. The revolution happened and now it is time for evolution. We dive into the following questions:\n\nHow did leniency help the initial adoption, but why and how do we lean more on strictness today?\nHow can upgrades be improved to avoid any downtime even when changing major versions?\nHow can new resiliency features improve recovery scenarios and add totally new features?\nWhy are types finally disappearing and how are we are trying to avoid the upgrade pain as much as possible?\nWhat are examples for some clever performance improvements?\nHow can you shrink and (finally) split shards in a highly efficient way?\nAttendees learn both about new and upcoming features as well as the motivation and engineering challenges behind them."
