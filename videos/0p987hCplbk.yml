description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nA Beginner's Guide to eBPF Programming for Networking - Liz Rice, Isovalent\n\neBPF has been described as “Superpowers for Linux,” and recently we’ve seen an explosion of tools that use it to power networking, observability and security in the Cloud Native world. It's an exciting technology that enables running bespoke programs directly in the kernel. In this talk Liz uses live-coding examples to explore how eBPF programs are loaded and run in the kernel, and attached to a variety of networking-related events. You might have seen Liz give a similar talk before, with examples hooking into system calls. This updated version focuses networking examples, giving insight into how eBPF programs can inspect and manipulate packets to form the basis of sophisticated and high-performance networking tools."
