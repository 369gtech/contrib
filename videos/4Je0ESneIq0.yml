description: "At OSCON Ignite 2012, I did a short presentation on a Raspberry Pi and integrating it with a 3D printer. Since then, I have been asked dozens of different questions, with the most common being \"What is the difference between a Raspberry Pi and an Arduino?\" I hope to answer that question and more! I am a hobbyist and a layperson when it comes to Raspberry Pis - there are people all over doing fantastic things with their Raspberry Pis and big brains.\n\nJoin Ed Snajder for an interactive webcast where we explore:\n\n    What is a Raspberry Pi\n    Difference between Raspberry Pi and an Arduino\n    Cool things being done with Raspberry Pi\n    Inspire you to make awesome things with Raspberry Pi\n\nAbout Ed Snajder\n\nEd Snajder is the Database Administrator at Jive Software.
