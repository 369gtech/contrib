Depending on audience interest, Phil, Maciej, and Sean will address several topics, including: - Kubectl code tour which will provide basic knowledge for working on kubectl itself, as well as how to write kubectl plugins. - The main initiatives SIG-CLI is undertaking, including but not limited to: splitting kubectl out of main Kubernetes repository, plugins - its development and management, resource configuration with kustomize, dynamic commands, etc. - Gathering feedback and discussing problems people struggle the most with kubectl. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Uakq"
