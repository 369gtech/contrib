description: "One token to rule them all - Fido U2F on SpringBoot and Android\nDominik Dzienia i Ewa Nestorowicz\nWith dozens of websites we use on a daily basis and dozens of accounts, we need - more than ever - easy and secure solutions to authenticate. Fido U2F is emerging open standard for second factor authentication, backed by giants like Google and Facebook, and already available on Chrome & Firefox. It is cost efficient, secure by design, and protects privacy of its users, while still being easy to use. We will show how to leverage API provided by browsers to integrate U2F token with SpringBoot based app, we also demonstrate how to support U2F on native Android over NFC protocol."
