description: "In this webcast Steve talk's about how to apply the recent explosion of research on decision making and behavioral economics to the practical problems of designing software products.\n\nIn this webcast you will learn:\n\n- A quick overview of how the mind makes decisions about what to do next (and when it's on autopilot)\n- A step-by-step approach to designing products that help people change their daily behavior (from exercising to checking email)\n- Guidance on how to integrate explicit behavioral goals into existing product development, UX, engineering, and QC processes\n- Techniques for quickly assessing the behavioral bottlenecks in an application that block its effectiveness\n\nAbout Steve Wendel\n\nSteve Wendel is the Principal Scientist at HelloWallet, where they develop products that help people take control of their finances — to figure out where their money is going, pay off debts, and save for the future. He has the joy of running experiments with HelloWallet's academic advisers, providing behavioral feedback on application design, and working with some awesome product and UX folks. He's a behavioral social scientist by training, and is fascinated with the rapidly growing experimental evidence on how we humans make decisions. He blogs regularly about how to design products to help people take action and change their daily routines, at actiondesign.hellowallet.com\n\nProduced by: Yasmina Greco"
