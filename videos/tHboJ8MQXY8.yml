title: 'Lukas Bytautas & Aivaras Vencevičius - This Is Not Your House!'
language: English
recordingDate: 1620028088
description: "\"Building a product, good or bad, could be compared to building a house. There is a bunch of people involved, all of them bringing different skills to the table, lots of moving parts and decisions to be made both before, and along the process. There are expectations, goals, milestones, deadlines, and budgets involved, all of which make building a quality house just about as difficult as delivering a successful digital product. However, one thing that is commonly forgotten along the way is that whatever role you are taking in ‘building a house, you are not the one who is going to be living there. In other words, you are NOT the tenant of the house. So treat the process of building it accordingly.\n\nLukas and Aivaras will cover this process from two different perspectives – user experience & product ownership. They will share insights and lessons learned while working in the YOLO squad – team building Mobile Investment solution for Danske Bank, one of the biggest Nordic banks.\n\nWe expect people leaving this session to go out with their own conclusion of how a successful team should approach building a product that is designed and built for the end-users.\""
