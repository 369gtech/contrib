description: "PowerShell has been widely used to automate cloud resources in organization, as well as on premises, for years. Most of these scenarios are based on events that happen on the infrastructure or application that must be immediately acted upon in order to meet service level agreements and time to recovery.\nWith the release of PowerShell preview in Azure Functions, it is now possible to automate these operational tasks and take advantage of the native Azure integration to modernize the delivering and maintenance of services."
