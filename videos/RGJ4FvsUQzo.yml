Despite the name, these languages are usually fairly conventional programming languages used to impose constraints on the transactions permitted to transfer assets and manipulate data stored on the blockchain.\n\nGiven the high financial stakes and widely publicised exploits on first generation (Bitcoin) and second generation (Ethereum) blockchains, the third-generation Cardano blockchain places a strong emphasis on functional programming and formal methods. This includes a new approach to contract languages based on state-of-the art research in programming languages and the increased safety provided by functional programming. The benefits of functional programming go even further: instead of having to invent yet another custom language, we simply use Haskell for the job, we design a superior blockchain architecture, and we seamlessly combine on-chain and off-chain computations.\n\nRead the full abstract: http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2019/manuel-m-t-chakravarty\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - MANUEL M T CHAKARAVARTY\nTweag I/O & IOHK \n\nManuel M T Chakravarty works with Tweag I/O as a functional programming evangelist, architects blockchain languages at IOHK, and develops the interactive development environment Haskell for Mac â€” one of the first Swift apps on the Mac App Store. His interests span from functional programming, novel compiler technology & programming language theory over high-performance & distributed computing to blockchain technology. \n\nMore on Manuel M T Chakaravarty: http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2019/manuel-m-t-chakravarty\n\n---\n\nLAMBDA DAYS & ERLANG SOLUTIONS\nLambda Days is powered by Erlang Solutions.
