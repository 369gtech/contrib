description: "In this session, Sid Anand talks about Apache Airflow, an up-and-coming platform to programmatically author, schedule, manage, and monitor workflows. Airflow’s design requires users to define DAGs (directed acyclic graphs) a.k.a. workflows in Python code, so that DAGs can be managed via the same software engineering principles and practices used to manage any other code.\n\nWith more than 7600 GitHub stars, 2400 forks, 430 contributors, 150 companies officially using it, and 4600 commits, Apache Airflow is quickly gaining traction among data science, ETL engineering, data engineering, and DevOps communities at large. \n\nSid Anand currently serves as PayPal's Chief Data Engineer, focusing on ways to realize the value of data.\n\nThis video was recorded at QCon.ai 2018: https://bit.ly/2piRtLl \n\nThe next QCon is in New York, June 25-29, 2018.
