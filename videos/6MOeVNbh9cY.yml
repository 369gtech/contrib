description: "Bethany Fong, Miki Konno \n\nIn the Android UX team, it is critical to get user feedback frequently and consistently so that we are able to iterate and develop the best-in-class designs for our users.  We will discuss how the team applied \"\"Pulse Studies\"\" (iterative research sessions) in order to put new ideas, designs, and concepts in front of users on a regular basis; it requires minimal advance planning, it can have an immediate product impact, and it can meet urgent needs.  We will illustrate how we accomplished this collaborative process by presenting rich examples and case studies.  We will also demonstrate usability study role playing in order to give you tips and tricks on how to adopt this process for anyone who is interested in getting user feedback in a quick and impactful way.\n\nFor all I/O 2013 sessions, go to https://developers.google.com/live"
