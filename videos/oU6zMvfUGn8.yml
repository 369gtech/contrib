title: 'Pushing Java EE Outside the Enterprise Space: Home Automation and the Internet of Things'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433258946
description: "Java EE is a rich platform widely used in the enterprise. This session looks at the relevance of Java EE outside of this traditional domainâ€”that is, how Java EE is also relevant for the connected home and, more generally, for the Internet of Things. The session covers the various extension points and technologies available in Java EE to integrate external systems, such as using JCA to connect to a KNX bus, the most widely used protocol in home automation. Home automation is by nature highly event-driven, so the presentation looks at how message-driven beans and CDI can be leveraged in this context. Finally, it also looks at additional technologies that are relevant in the Internet of Things space, such as JAX-RS and WebSocket.\n\n\nAuthor:\nDavid Delabassee\nDavid Delabassee is a Principal Product Manager working in the GlassFish team at Oracle.
