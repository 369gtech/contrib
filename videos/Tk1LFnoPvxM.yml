description: "In October of 2008, I'd been unemployed for about four months. I was doing some consulting work, but still feeling entirely uncertain about my ability to make a living, so I did the obvious thing: I decided it was a good time to learn how to fly a plane.\n\nOver the course of many months, more than a few bad landings, and even a wee bit of engine failure, I learned some stark lessons that have stuck with me even today. Those lessons — about being new at a thing, finding a way forward when you're lost, knowing when it's time to give up and regroup, and so much more — have turned out to be oddly relevant to my journey in engineering management, too.\n\nAbout Rebecca Murphey\nRebecca Murphey leads the Front-End Core engineering group at Indeed. In her 3.5 years there, she's built a global team that enables Indeed teams around the world to build and experiment on products that help people get jobs. After five years in Austin, she lives in Durham, NC, with her partner, their son, a dog, and a new flock of chickens."
