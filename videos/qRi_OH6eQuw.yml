title: 'YOW! 2017 Julie Pitt - Machines that Learn Through Action: The Future of AI'
language: English
recordingDate: 1520755657
description: "Deep Learning has led to breakthroughs in many previously unsolved problem domains, from image classification to machine translation to medical imaging analysis. Venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz recently cooked up an AI playbook, which posits that AI will impact software as broadly as relational databases have since the late 20th century. It’s hard to think of a technological problem that AI doesn’t touch.\nIn this talk, we will explore the limits of today’s most popular approaches to AI. In particular, what kinds of problems can’t we solve today and how might the solutions shape the way we approach software development? Training a model for your particular domain is easier than ever, but why is it so difficult to make sense of what is going on inside the model? How can we move toward a more intuitive and accessible model for understanding what our AI has learned?\n\nJulie co-founded Order of Magnitude Labs in 2014 to build AI capable of doing things that humans find easy and today’s machines can’t do in a practical setting. She spent the previous 12 years developing server-side applications in a variety of environments, from startups to government institutions. Most notably, she was on the team that first brought Netflix to a variety of popular platforms and launched the service internationally. Along the way, Julie made several round trips between engineering and management. Scala has been her home language since 2012, and she occasionally dabbles in web development and hardware hacking.\n\nFor more information on YOW! Conference visit: www.yowconference.com.au"
