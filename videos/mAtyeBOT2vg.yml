description: "Suppose you want to have a general understanding of how the performance changes when you add a new JVM argument. For instance, you develop an agent, and you want to make sure that the clients’ performance does not suffer when it’s attached. Or you want to see if it is a good idea to enable a JVM option by default.\n\nThere are surprisingly many ways to do it wrong. The talk will cover some of them and discuss the general problem of benchmark suites for Java."
