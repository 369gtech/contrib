description: 'At the beginning there was Procedural, then came Object-Oriented languages. Now we are in Functional Programming era. At least this is what they said. But what does it mean design in Functional way? How can category theory, which is a Mathematical tool-set help us here? Can we use the concept of morphisms and functors in our day to day programming job? Can functional programming be a more productive approach than standard design? I think so and I''ll show some concrete examples from my day to day job of how these rules work very well with the theoretical concepts of functional programming. Categories, functors and natural transformations can naturally emerge from our code and understand them can lead to a better design.'
