description: "Google Tech Talks\nFebruary, 22 2008\n\nABSTRACT\n\nBy using parameterization methods which model the knowledge space of a social or cognitive process, it is possible to use artificial intelligence techniques such as Neural Networks and Genetic Programming to create new types of visualization, creation, search and expression for a range of digital media. Steve DiPaola will discuss and demonstrate his research in cognitive 3D and 2D graphics, AI and simulation work, including real-time voice- and behavior-based 3D facial communication, simulated critters (an interacting group of whales) and creative exploration over optimized search as well as cognitively-based computational photography and music. (See ivizlab.sfu.ca).\n\nSpeaker: Steve DiPaola \nArtist and scientist Steve DiPaola is a professor at Simon Frazier University. \nHe directs iVizLab, which strives to make interactive and simulation\nsystems bend more to the human experience by incorporating biological and\ncognitive models. He came to SFU from Stanford and NYIT CGL and has\nheld leadership positions at Electronic Arts, Saatchi Innovation and\nSilicon Valley start-ups. His art has been exhibited internationally, at\nvenues including the AIR and Tibor de Nagy galleries in NYC, the Whitney\nMuseum and the Smithsonian. He has collaborated with Nam June Paik and\nKraftwerk and is known for making new media tools used equally by\nartists and scientists. (See dipaola.org)."
