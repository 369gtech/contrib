description: "Microservices are all the range, and so are security breaches! Learn what you can do to try and have one without the other.\n\nMicroservices give us many options. We can pick different technologies, mix synchronous and asynchronous integration techniques or embrace different deployment patterns. But they also give us different options in how we think about securing our systems. Done right, and microservices can increase the security of your vital data and processes. Done wrong, and you can increase the surface area of attack. This talk will discuss the importance of defence in depth, discussing the many different ways in which you can secure your fine-grained, distributed architectures.\n\nThe audience should come away with a working framework for thinking about AppSec, and also understand how microservices can help (or hinder) building a secure system.\n\nSam Newman\nAfter working at ThoughtWorks for over a decade, I've now joined a startup who are looking at making the process of building software much easier.\n\nI wrote \"Building Microservices\", which was published by O'Reilly at the beginning of 2015.\n\nBlog: http://samnewman.io/\n\n[RBY-6694]"
