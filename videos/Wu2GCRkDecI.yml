description: "Trying to build a web app that is large, maintainable, and fast? In the past, you’d have to pick two, at best. But what if it didn’t need to be this way? \n\nOn the Polymer project, we’re aiming to push the web platform and provide libraries and tools so that it might become easier to get the best of all worlds when building on the web. In this video, Taylor goes over the latest with the Polymer Project, including an end-to-end walkthrough of how the Polymer team envisions using web components, service worker, and other new web platform features to build high-quality PWA’s.\n\nCheck out the rest of the Chrome Dev Summit videos here: https://goo.gl/ekCoVu                \nSubscribe to the Google Chrome Developers channel: http://goo.gl/LLLNvf"
