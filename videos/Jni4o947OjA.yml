description: 'Thanks to the use of DNA in criminal investigations, hundreds of innocent people have been exonerated from crimes they did not commit. DNA has also been used to used to arrest suspects in cold cases! In my presentation I will give a primer on the techniques used for DNA profiling and the statistics for false positives. The bulk of my presentation will be looking into the vulnerabilities of current DNA profiling methods and how a malicious actor could actually reconstruct enough genotypic information of any innocent person from just a picture of their face. This is based on recently published Nature Genetics research and extends the methods to suggest that it would only take ~50 million face:genotype samples to have a sufficient genotypic mapping that would allow someone to recreate your 23andMe profile (602,000 SNPs) from a selfie.'
