description: 'Kubernetes misconfigurations put applications at risk for privilege escalations and other vulnerabilities. With over 30 security settings under the control of development teams itâ€™s easy for applications to become compromised. This webinar will introduce the Kubernetes Common Configuration Scoring System (KCCSS), an open-source framework to calculate risk scores for Kubernetes workloads, and kube-scan, an open-source risk assessment tool that identifies workloads at risk, what the consequences are, and helps prioritize remediation with PodSecurityPolicy, Pod definitions, and manifest files. Learn how each project was designed, how they work, and see them in action in a test environment.'
