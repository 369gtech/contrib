While it's great for users to have options, lots of choices can make it difficult for Kubernetes users to make decisions or know where to start. Additionally, organizations may use several different tools internally that users must familiarize themselves with. A high-level understanding of the this ecosystem is necessary to easily navigate the world of Kubernetes. Gabbi and Phillip will provide an overview of well-known and up-and-coming Kubernetes CLIs. They will then explore the broader architectures used by these tools, and finally how users should think about their own tools they are building. CLI’s covered include kubectl, helm, kustomize, k/jsonnet, kpt, cue and k14s . CLI patterns covered include templating, DSLs, OpenAPI / schema and configuration functions. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ek9o"
