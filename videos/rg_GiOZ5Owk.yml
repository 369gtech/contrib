title: 'Rob Conery - Document Storage Techniques with PostgreSQL and JSONB'
recordingDate: 1443088265
description: 'The PostgreSQL team introduced the JSONB datatype with the release of PostgreSQL 9.4. It’s had the JSON datatype for a while, but JSONB is a bit different. Very different. It’s binary storage of JSON (just like MongoDB), which allows you to apply some powerful indexing for a great speed boost. In fact, early benchmarks have shown some incredible results against MongoDB and CouchDB. Which is neat, but how can you actually use this new ability in PostgreSQL? In this talk Rob Conery will show some techniques for working with documents in PostgreSQL, including some useful utility functions and ways you can flex a document structure to get your project off the ground.'
