recordingDate: 1536932543
description: 'Developers constantly strive to make stunning apps which not only solve day to day problems but augment life of their users in a way that the app becomes an important part of their lives. The examples of such disruptive apps is endless but at the same time it’s also important that an app for many does not leave few behind. In our quest for building next great app Apple and Android both provides apis to keep accessibility integral part of application design. In this talk I’ll be introducing this concept to every React Native developer and give handson how they can make use of voiceover, accessibility properties and other accessibility elements part of their RN app to make an application inclusive for all. I am equally excited to talk and give demo on this topic since such reminders have far reaching effect on developer community when they build their next app.'
