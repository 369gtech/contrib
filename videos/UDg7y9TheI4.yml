title: 'Next-Generation Cloud Native Apps with Spring Cloud and Kubernetes'
language: English
recordingDate: 1632325418
description: "For years, Spring Cloud has provided cloud native functionality allowing some of the biggest tech companies in the world to build the most robust, resilient, distributed, and innovative applications we have ever seen. \n \n Using a combination of open source technologies, Spring Cloud provides essential functionality (such as service discovery, client-side load balancing, resiliency, tracing, and even contract testing) that makes building, running, and maintaining these applications at scale a reality. As the platforms these applications run on continue to evolve, some of the functionality in Spring Cloud has become part of the platform, which leads to the question: “What role does Spring Cloud have on these platforms?” \n \n In this session, we make the case that Spring Cloud still provides a wealth of critical functionality to your applications as you transition them to Kubernetes and similar cutting-edge platforms.\n\nRyan Baxter, Staff Software Engineer at VMware\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/nextgeneration-cloud-native-apps-with-spring-cloud-and-kubernetes"
