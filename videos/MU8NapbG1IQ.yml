description: "Since several years, the world of JVM GC evolved. A new kind of GC emerges: low latency GCs. Shenandoah is provided by Red Hat and now merged into OpenJDK, Oracle open sourced ZGC in OpenJDK since JDK 11 and Azul C4 is sill there.â€‹\n\nAs \"classical\" GCs are well understood, this talk will focus on internals of the most recent ones. We will explain Concurrent Marking (tri-color marking), the C4's Load Value Barrier, Shenandoah's Brooks Pointers and ZGC's multi-mapping.\n\nFinally, how to choose a low latency GC?\n\nJean Philippe Bempel:\nDeveloper passionate by performance, runtimes (JVM, CLR) and Mechanical Sympathy supporter, Jean-Philippe has more than 8 years experience in low latency trading systems. Now, He brings his expertise on the JVM at Criteo in order to optimize resources on thousand node clusters."
