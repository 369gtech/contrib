title: 'We Live in a Simulation'

recordingDate: 1577898019
description: "We probably live in a simulation! In this video, I'll explain 5 reasons why I think this is the case. This is the first episode in my new biotechnology series titled \"Molecular Dharma\"! I thought it'd be useful to provide a frame for why I think biotech is an extremely interesting topic for developers (besides of course the promises of ending disease, hunger, waste, & climate change). If we live in a simulation, then Biology is inherently information based. And if that's the case, there's no limit on what we could create once we understand it's working principles. I'll include references from several recent books I've read and relevant quotes by popular figures. Enjoy! \n\nShare 1 Biotechnology application idea on social media using the hashtag #moleculardharma!
