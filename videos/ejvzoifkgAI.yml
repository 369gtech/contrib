title: 'Scripting at the Speed of Thought: Lua and C++ With sol3'
language: English
recordingDate: 1543446002
description: "A big part of accelerating development and promoting collaboration often translates to deferring a lot of the typical programmer work to a scripting language, to allow for those with more design-oriented ideas and experience to handle some of the workload. What happens, then, when you have to bind a scripting language like Lua into C++ to allow for this workflow? \n\nThis session is going to be all about how you enable non-developers and developers alike to rapidly increase their development productivity by turning routines and algorithms into data that can be shipped alongside your product in Lua. We will talk primarily how you can use the library sol2 to abstract away the muck of working with the Lua C API and instead focus on using and describing both Lua and C++ with each other in a simple manner. We will demonstrate some of the more interesting properties of sol such as Overloading Support, Container Support, Usertypes -- C++ classes made available with automatic support for unique/shared pointers -- and Tables. \n\nBy the time this session is over, you will have a firm grasp over what a good Lua Binding can offer you, and how you can accelerate your C++ development with it.\n\nEVENT:\n\nCppCon 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nJeanHeyd Meneide\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nCppCon Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video."
