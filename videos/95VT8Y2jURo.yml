title: 'Nate Kupp: From humble beginnings: building the data stack at Thumbtack'
recordingDate: 1542730967
description: "When I arrived at Thumbtack four years ago, we had no data infrastructure, a non-functional A/B testing tool, and zero machine learning in production. Since that time, we’ve built out data infrastructure on Google Cloud Platform that serves tens of thousands of analytics queries and executes hundreds of Airflow-scheduled batch jobs per day. On top of that platform, we’ve also built internal A/B testing infrastructure that our team uses on a daily basis to drive product decisions, along with TensorFlow-based machine learning pipelines to drive our marketplace dynamics.\n\n\nIn this talk, I will share some of our key learnings on our path to scale, and how these systems evolved at Thumbtack to meet the needs of our product and engineering teams. - Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/crunch"
