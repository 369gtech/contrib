recordingDate: 1364334487
description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2012.  Speakers: Gunnar Hillert, Gary Russell, Oleg Zhurakousky.  \nSpring Integration 2.2 introduces many exciting new features including among other things new adapters supporting MongoDB, Redis and JPA. Furthermore, the transaction synchronization support was expanded, allowing for the synchronization of inherently non-transactional resources with existing transactions.\n\nAnother noteworthy addition is the ability to add behavior to individual endpoints using advice chains. For example, Spring Integration 2.2 now provides out-of-the-box support for various retry strategies.\n\nAttend this session to learn about these and many other new features and improvements. We will also take a look at some of the things planned for Spring Integration 3.0."
