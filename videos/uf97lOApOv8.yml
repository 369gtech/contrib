description: "Keep the Space Shuttle Flying: Writing Robust Operators - Illya Chekrygin, Upbound \n\nAs the operator pattern becomes the de-facto pattern for extending Kubernetes, the community is increasingly adding new declarative APIs for external resources that are managed by traditional imperative API.\n\nIn this talk, we will explore a set of lessons learned from building Operators that bridge Kubernetes’ declarative API with external imperative API. We’ll cover some of the challenges around resource identity, long-running changes, retries, progress, handling failures, validation, dry-runs, deletions, and finalizers. These lessons are based on the real-world experience of building multiple complex operators within the Rook (https://rook.io), Crossplane (https://crossplane.io). \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPaN"
