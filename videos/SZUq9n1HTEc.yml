description: "\"The core idea of refactoring hasn't changed: a sequence of small things allows you to make a big change. Many of those \"small things\" are still the same, such as Extract Function.\"\n\nMartin Fowler\nAuthor, speaker, and general loud-mouth on Software Development.\n\nListen to the entire playlist: 5 essential software architecture podcasts to listen to in 2019\n\nhttps://www.infoq.com/5-software-architecture-podcasts-2019/\n\nMartin Fowler chats about the work he’s done over the last couple of years on the rewrite of the original Refactorings book. He discusses how this thought process has changed and how that’s affected the new edition of the book.
