description: 'Agile is not new. Agile is not a trend. Agile is established. We already celebrated that the Agile Manifesto has been written more than 10 years ago. Agile is now expanding and improving but too often people struggle. Things get wrong and Agile gets the blame. Still the business often turns out to be disappointed. Arie will take you back to the basics of WHY we do Agile and HOW to make it successful. Arie will guide the group to all questions so participants understand the rationale of using Agile and understanding their own role in creating business value as a team.'
