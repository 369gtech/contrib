title: 'Webinar: Pivoting Your Pipeline from Legacy to Cloud Native'
language: English

description: "When you begin your Cloud Native journey, you’ll quickly find that your current CI/CD pipeline is not going to make the grade. Kubernetes is finally moving us away from a monolithic approach to software development towards a service-based approach. This means each microservice will have its own life cycle and be independently deployable. This is the game changer. While you can force your current CI/CD pipeline to support microservices, this isn’t an optimal approach. With a cloud native environment comes new complexities. Just as a start, your configuration management shifts from check-in and build where linking is resolved, to a container build and run-time APIs. Join Tracy Ragan, CEO of DeployHub and CDF Board Member for a review of what a K8s pipeline look like, and how your current pipeline is disrupted.\_ Meet Nathan Martin of Sagecore Technologies who will provide us a real world case study on managing microservice configuration with DeployHub (Ortelius.io open source) and routing with Istio Service Mesh in a modern pipeline.\n\n\nTakeaways:\nFor most organizations,\_microservices will have their own repository and workflows. CD tools will need to support workflow templates.\nConfiguration management will be lost as large monolithic builds are replaced or non-existence. Link decision making is done at runtime – not by a build manager.\nService Mesh\_becomes core to deploying and routing microservices.\n\nMeet Nathan Martin of Sagecore Technologies who will provide us a real world case study on managing microservice configuration with DeployHub and routing with Istio in a modern pipeline.\n\nJoin Tracy Ragan, CEO of DeployHub and CDF Board Member for a review of what a K8s pipeline look like, and how your current pipeline is disrupted.\n\nPresenters:\n\nNathan Martin, CEO @Sagecore Technologies\nTracy Ragan, CEO @DeployHub"
