Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nHouston, We’ve Got a Problem! : How to Debug your Pipeline in Tekton - Vibhav Bobade & Vincent Demeester, Red Hat\n\nIt’s always been nice to have CI/CD as a part of your infrastructure. Nothing better than being able to automate your workflows and have jobs done for you in a timely manner. It would be a shame if your jobs/pipelines break now would it. Now all you need to do is sit and take apart the individual components of your pipeline and figure out where you went wrong. We have all been there. Only if we could debug our Pipelines :) As common as task debugging is in the programming world, in the CI/CD world, it is ridden with complexities of the infrastructure and reiterative approaches which kill time. With Tekton, it is possible to debug your pipelines on the go without stopping/restarting your PipelineRun. Tekton is a Kubernetes based, lightweight, serverless, and an easy to manage CI/CD solution which a user can use to create as well as debug their PipelineRuns at a Step level to understand what is wrong with their pipeline providing a more complete CI/CD solution."
