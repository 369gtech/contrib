description: "JDK 8 has introduced a new Compact Profiles feature that allows for three subsets of Java SE 8 APIs that are compliant with the JDK 8 spec. Compact Profiles will enable the creation of JDK 8 Java runtimes that will be able to support configurations that previously were possible only with a subset of JDK 1.5. This session describes the contents of Compact Profiles, how to build them, and details of the Oracle-provided OpenJDK and binary implementations for embedded and mobile. The presentation describes Compact Profiles use cases such as the embedded, iOS, and Android mobile platforms and application store packaging.\n\n\nAuthors:\n Hinkmond Wong\nHinkmond Wong is a Consulting Member of Technical Staff with the Java\nEmbedded group and has been working at former Sun Microsystems, Inc.,\nnow Oracle for over 19 years.
