description: "** Python Certification Training: https://www.edureka.co/data-science-python-certification-course **\nThis Edureka video on 'Data Structures in Python' will help you understand the various data structures that Python has built into itself such as the list, dictionary, tuple and more. Further, we will also understand stacks, queues, trees and how they are implemented in Python using classes and functions. The video is divided into the following parts:\nWhat are Data Structures?\nWhy are Data Structures needed?\nTypes of Data Structures in Python\n    Built-In Data Structures\n        Lists\n        Dictionary\n        Tuple\n        Sets\n    User-Defined Data Structure\n        Array\n        Stack\n        Queue\n        Linked List\n        Tree\n        Graph\n\nPython Tutorial Playlist: https://goo.gl/WsBpKe\nBlog Series: http://bit.ly/2sqmP4s\n\nPG in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning with NIT Warangal : https://www.edureka.co/post-graduate/machine-learning-and-ai\n\nPost Graduate Certification in Data Science with IIT Guwahati - https://www.edureka.co/post-graduate/data-science-program \n(450+ Hrs || 9 Months || 20+ Projects & 100+ Case studies)\n\n#Edureka #PythonEdureka #PythonBasics #Pythontutorialforbeginners #learnpython #pythonforbeginners #pythonprogramming #pythontutorial #PythonTraining \n\nPlease do subscribe to our channel and hit the bell icon to never miss an update from us in the future: https://goo.gl/6ohpTV \n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/edureka_learning/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/edurekaIN/ \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/edurekain \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/edureka \nSlideshare:  https://www.slideshare.net/EdurekaIN \n \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nHow does it work?\n1.
