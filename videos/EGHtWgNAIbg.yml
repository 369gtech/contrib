title: 'Google Home meets .NET containers on Google Cloud - Ian Talarico & Mete Atamel'
recordingDate: 1535533727
description: "What does it take to connect a Google Home to a .NET container running in the cloud? Surprisingly, not much! In this talk, we will use Dialogflow to setup a Google Home device to talk to a .NET container managed by Kubernetes Engine.\nWe will take a look at some of the Google Cloud services such as Machine Learning APIs, BigQuery and see how they can elevate our Google Home to the next level. If youâ€™re curious about what Google has to offer for your .NET apps, this talk is for you!"
