recordingDate: 1556665688
description: "Android apps are not just series of static screens. To create a great app you will have to bring it into life with meaningful, helpful and delightful motion.\n\nHowever, a good design is not worth much unless it gets implemented correctly. In this joint designer-developer talk we discuss the workflow from the idea, to design and development and all the way to userâ€™ hands. \n\nWe describe when to use motion and when not to as well as selecting the right type and right intensity of motion. We then dive into the best implementation strategies including communicating state, navigation, feedback, tutorial and delightful animations.\n\nhttps://it.droidcon.com/2019/it\nhttps://twitter.com/droidconit\nhttps://www.facebook.com/droidconIt"
