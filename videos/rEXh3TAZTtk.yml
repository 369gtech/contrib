description: 'Guerrilla Red Team is a methodology by which a company can grow security IQ, technical expertise, and security brainpower, resulting in an internal mesh network of trusted decentralized ethical hackers. The program requires minimal capital investment from the hosting red team. It achieves its primary goals through weekly group mentorship hosted during a four-hour block, once per week, during the workday. It forms a peer network in which guerrilla operators share ideas and techniques, and ultimately grow technically and professionally as a unit. Members of the program come from various technical disciplines, but not necessarily security-focused verticals. The cohort of five to six members follows a nine-week syllabus that takes them from someone with minimal red team experience to autonomous operations. Guerrilla Operators will have a regular cadence of operations, which will require deconfliction from the parent red team to only ensure there are no safety concerns with the proposed target. Expected outcomes for the nine-week cohort are as follows: Guerrilla operators are armed with the skills to continue their red team learning, as well as a support network for challenging tasks The parent red team has an expanded network of internal, trusted, ethical hackers. This strengthens idea generation for campaigns, and enables communication through the use of a shared and common technical language. Over time, the Guerrilla Red Team provides a steady flow of trained homegrown red team operators or security analysts The company itself benefits by having security-focused mindsets placed throughout technical disciplines, resulting in staff that are poised to ward off attacks by thinking like an attacker, functioning similarly to security-focused Site Reliability Engineers (SRE) Provides the company with verification that their security program and infrastructure are as robust as they say it is through the use of decentralized, independent low-tier actors attacking the network: an Offsec ChaosMonkey Provides the guerrilla operators real world, hands on experience in a career field that is hard to break into outside of the Federal pipeline'
