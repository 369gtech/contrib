description: "This video was recorded at Lambda Days 2019 http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2019\n\nGet involved in Lambda Days' next conference http://www.lambdadays.org\n\n---\n\nFAST & FUNCTIONAL\nby Michał Płachta\n\nABSTRACT\nIn this talk we are going to create a functional and blazingly fast microservice. We will use functional programming abstractions to quickly mix & match different HTTP libraries, state implementations and concurrency configurations. Each step will be followed by a performance analysis using different tools from JVM toolbox. This talk is for you if you want to see how cats IO monad, async-profiler, flame graphs and wrk are used together to create nanoseconds-fast Scala service for YouTube videos statistics.\n\nRead the full abstract: http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2019/michal-plachta\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - MICHAŁ PŁACHTA\nMaking games using λs \n\nPolyglot programmer & functional programming enthusiast.
