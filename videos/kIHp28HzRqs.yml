description: 'Not only is it a myth that one needs higher education to get into video games development and publishing, but also that there are only a few different job roles in the games industry. It takes all types of roles and skill sets to make and publish video games. People from all walks are part of the creation, development, promotion and sales of a video game. Meet folks from across Xbox Game Studios that will share their origin story and give advice on how to get a foot through the door.'
