title: 'Permission to Fail'
language: English
recordingDate: 1601026407
description: "\"We all make mistakes; it’s part of what makes us human. At the same time, we worry about the impact. Will I be blamed? Will I be called out and ridiculed? Will I lose my job? Companies are rapidly releasing and deploying code. As a result, things sometimes break. This shouldn’t result in fear and panic when something goes wrong. \n\nPeople need permission to learn, and with the permission to learn comes the permission to fail. We learn from our mistakes. When a mistake is made, we iterate, and make changes to find a better solution. Mistakes lead to new knowledge. \n\nThis talk will explore what is needed from a cultural, processes, and tools perspective to build an environment that embraces learning: \n\n-Building a blameless culture\n-Providing psychological safety\n-Embracing experimentation\n-Putting safety mechanisms in place\"\n\nDawn Parzych, Developer Advocate at LaunchDarkly\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/permission-to-fail-238445801"
