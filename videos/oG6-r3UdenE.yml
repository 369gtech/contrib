description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTOpia Europe 2020. #GOTOcon #GOTOpia\nhttp://gotopia.eu\n\nMike Amundsen - The (API) uncle you wish you had — the ultimate expert\n\nABSTRACT\nAPIs are the glue that hold modern software together. If your API fails, it all fails. Folks also tend to overcomplicate the API design. Mike will teach you how write solid APIs without overdoing it.\nOnce your API is released out into the wild, you'll see users using it in new and creative ways — often in ways that weren't intended in the first place. Which is how we get to versioning — you can't just change the original without violating all those creative initiatives.\nCompanies that adopt a single API definition format (OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, Schema Definition Language, Protobuff, etc.) are likely to find their options limited as their API ecosystem grows and matures over time.\nIn order to avoid forcing the entire company to adopt a single API style or format, no matter the requirements of providers and consumers, we need a solid, simple and repeatable way to design APIs [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n02:50 Overview\n04:49 A story of API design & governance\n10:05 The challenge of HTTP-centric API design\n15:37 A unified method for API design\n19:30 Examples/demo\n28:07 A unified method for API design continued\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotopia.eu/2020/sessions/1462/graphql-grpc-and-rest-oh-my-a-method-for-unified-api-design\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#APIs #GraphQL #gRPC #REST #RESTapis #APIDesign #OpenAPI #AsyncAPI #Protobuff\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
