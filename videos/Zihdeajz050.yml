description: 'All non-trivial software inevitably grows in complexity over time. Regardless of best intentions, with continuous releases of new functionality, design debt threatens to cripple our applications: they become confusing and increasingly hard to understand and use. Alexandra will share lessons learnt and make suggestions on how to avoid overcomplicating our UIs as our applications grow.'
