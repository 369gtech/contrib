title: 'A Racket Perspective on Research, Education, and Production - Matthew Flatt'
language: English
recordingDate: 1574465834
description: "It’s natural to think of research, education, and production as having competing goals. In programming-language design, for example, the needs\nof beginning students can differ greatly from the needs of practicing programmers, while research may explore ideas that are not yet worked out enough for either audience. With a shift in perspective, however,\nwe can not only balance these goals but have them reinforce each other. The developers of Racket have integrated all three directions from the beginning (and now for 24 years). We’ll talk about opportunities, challenges, results, and outlook based on that experience."
