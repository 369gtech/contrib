See http://fitc.ca for details.\n\nOverview\nThis talk will dissect a few web animation failures and the lessons learned from using a mash-up of techniques. It also places emphasis on a designer-mentality to animation resulting in an inseparable relationship between motion and layout… the sweet spot where badassness happens.\n\nWeb animation has dominated conferences for the last few years. It is no surprise given Google’s push with Material Design and the amazing strides the industry has made in animation-rich mobile apps.
