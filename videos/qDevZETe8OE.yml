description: "Filmed at https://2018.dotjs.io on November 9th in Paris. More talks on https://dotconferences.com/talks\n\nMinecraft is getting a JavaScript runtime. It means two things: 1) game logic will be exposed through a new API that you can use to create your own mods, and 2) the way Minecraft’s UI is built and shipped on everything from Android and iOS to Switch and Xbox will be completely overhauled. Tobias goes through the technical details of their integration, why they’re doing it, and what they think it means for Minecraft players."
