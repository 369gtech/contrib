title: 'Microsoft Tech Days: A flight into IoT'
language: English
recordingDate: 1636981930
description: "Interested in building an end-to-end IoT solution or learning about Azure IoT, but aren't quite sure how to get started? Clifford Agius and Pete Gallagher – both Microsoft MVPs - will take you through an end-to-end solution from real flight tracking data like speed, altitude and location from a flight departing London. \n\nDuring the event we’ll track the flight’s progress to its destination and show how to get that data from an IoT device at the edge into Microsoft Azure IoT and the cloud where it can be processed for display on a dashboard or stored for later processing."
