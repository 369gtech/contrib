description: "\"Build your Python Extensions with Rust!\n[EuroPython 2019 - Talk - 2019-07-10 - PyCharm]\n[Basel, CH]\n\nBy Paul Ganssle\n\nWhen your Python needs to be fast, one powerful tool is the ability to write compiled extension modules. Normally this is done using the C API, but that requires managing reference counts and memory allocation and is nearly impossible to do emcorrectly/em for non-trivial programs. In this talk, we'll look at how you can write extension modules in Rust - a memory-safe systems programming language that is increasingly popular as a replacement for C and C++, and the a href=\"\"https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#technology-_-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-languages\"\"most loved language in the Stack Overflow developer survey 4 years running/a.\n\nThis talk will focus on codepyo3/code and codemilksnake/code, two popular libraries that provide very different approaches for writing Rust extensions; it will cover a basic introduction to the libraries, and compare their relative strengths and weaknesses. These will also be compared to C and Cython extension modules from a performance, safety and maintainability perspective.\nk\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2019.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/"
