title: 'Visualizing Olympic Medals with F# and Fable - Tomas Petricek'
recordingDate: 1493102315
description: "What if you could look at the source code behind any online visualization, check what data sources it uses, reproduce the results and modify any of its parameters?\nIn this talk, I will present a data visualization project that I created around the Olympic games (http://rio2016.thegamma.net) which visualizes interesting facts about Olympic medals, but more importantly - lets you modify existing visualizations, interactively explore the data on your own and share your insights.\n\nAlong the way, you will learn about building functional client-side web applications with F# and Fable â€“ the F# to JavaScript compiler for 21st century. I will discuss how type providers change how we think about data, how functional types save the day and let you model complex domain (of data transformations) with a few lines of code and how immutability and functional programming make it easier to build interactive web applications (and what nice patterns can we learn from Elm)"
