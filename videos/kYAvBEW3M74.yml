description: "by Manfred Steyer\n\nWeb Development is exciting nowadays! We get new innovative technologies on a regular basis. While this is awesome it can also be overwhelming, especially when you have to maintain a product for the long term.\n\nWeb Components and Micro Apps provide a remedy for this dilemma. They allow for decomposing a big solution into small self-contained parts that can be maintained by different teams using the best technology for the requirements in question. Come to this session and find out how this idea helps with writing applications that can evolve over a decade and more.\n\nLet's peacefully unite the best technologies for the different parts of our big enterprise applications!"
