description: "Slides: https://michalwarda.github.io/css-wrong/\n\nIn my career I wrote a lot of bad code. When I got back to it I could tell what was wrong, and use this knowledge, to not make the same mistakes in the future.\n\nNot with CSS though. I've used different frameworks, methodologies, preprocessors and I never got the feeling why it worked or not.\n\nI decided to study this topic. In my presentation I will approach styling from a Software Engineering POV. I'll explain the theory of writing testable code and how it affects CSS programming. What parts of CSS we forgot about, but should be using. How we can up our game even more with CSS-in-JS and why you should finally drop BEM.\n\n---\n\nConFrontJS 2018 - #Frontend #Conference in #Warsaw, Poland\nDate: 29 October 2018\nVenue: Campus Warsaw, Poland\n\n▶︎ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/events/2149337285314631/\n▶︎ Meetup: https://www.meetup.com/WarsawJS/events/255480769/\n▶︎ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/confrontjs.photos/\n▶︎ Twitter: https://twitter.com/confrontjs\n▶︎ Homepage: https://confrontjs.com/\n\nProduction: Strefa Zero\nhttps://strefazero.com.pl"
