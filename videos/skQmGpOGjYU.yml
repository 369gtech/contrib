description: "Speaker: Yang Zhixing \r\n\r\niPhone X has arrived with its all-new Super Retina display for more immersive experiences and Face ID, a secure way to unlock, authenticate, and pay. It also comes with rounded corners on screen and a top notch that was never there before. Moreover, it launches with tons of new features and new APIs for developers as well, and some of the existing features have evolved and may have changed their behaviour. \r\n\r\nAll these have brought new design and development challenges for app developers. As developers dedicated to our users, it is our responsibility to adapt to this change and make sure our users can enjoy the new bezel-less OLED display to the fullest. \r\n\r\nIn this episode, we will summarise what are the changes on iPhone X, address some of the issues and challenges, and share some experiences, tips and tricks of what developers could do to enable users to take advantage of the new interface and new interactions.\r\n\r\nSpeaker Bio:\r\nZhixing is an iOS developer at Sea, currently working in the Shopee Apps Team. He enjoys building UI that burns GPUs. \r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/Tech-at-Sea/events/245100266/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\r\nRecorded by: Yeo Kheng Meng"
