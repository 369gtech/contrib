description: "O'Reilly Strata Online Conference\nMoving to Big Data\n\nEveryone buys in to the mantra of the data-driven enterprise. Companies that put data to work make smarter decisions than their competitors. They can engage customers, employees, and partners more effectively. And they can adapt faster to changing market conditions. It's not just internal data, either: a social, connected web has given us new firehoses to drink from, and combining public and private data yields valuable new insights.\n\nUnfortunately for many businesses, the information they need is languishing in data warehouses. It's accessible only to Business Intelligence experts and database experts. It's encased in legacy databases with arcane interfaces.\n\nBig Data promises to unlock this data for the entire company. But getting there will be hard: replacing decades-old platforms and entire skill sets doesn't happen overnight. In this online event, we'll look at how Big Data stacks and analytical approaches are gradually finding their way into organizations, as well as the roadblocks that can thwart efforts to become more data-driven.\n\nPart 3: Take a Lesson from the Research World (15m)\nKaitlin Thaney (Digital Science)\n\nThe Web has transformed not only the way we approach modern day science, but a number of other facets of the research cycle: tools for analysis, mediums which now serve as \"information inputs\", how we exchange ideas and even discover knowledge. This shift in practice, understanding and resources is happening at a broader scale, extending beyond the traditional research environment on the institutional level to big business and industry. But the machine is not nearly as well-oiled as we'd like to think, and there are still breaks in the system keeping us from doing more efficient work.\n\nIn this talk, Kaitlin will posit that we're not only \"getting this wrong\" in the academic research context, but that these problems are also finding their way in to the broader research enterprise. She'll look at how financial, social and technical constraints are affecting the way we perceive and handle information, and what the best means forward to fixing the breaks in the system is."
