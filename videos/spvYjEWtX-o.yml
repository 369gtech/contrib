recordingDate: 1637345709
description: "On this weekly Office Hours for Oracle Machine Learning on Autonomous Database,  Jie Liu, Data Scientist for Oracle Machine Learning, covered the best practices when using Machine Learning Regression metrics.  \n\nThe goal of a regression task is to build models based on features to predict a target quantity, that is, a numeric value. After a regression model is applied to a test set, the next step is to evaluate the model performance by checking the error between the regression output and the true value.  A certain set of metrics is often used to evaluate the regression model such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and R squared, etc.  What are the differences among those metrics? How does one choose a metric correctly? How does the metric translate back to the business world? \n\nIn this Session, Jie went through various regression metrics and addressed the questions above.  Moreover, he showed how to compute regression metrics in a scalable way using OML4Py.\n\nThe Oracle Machine Learning product family supports data scientists, analysts, developers, and IT to achieve data science project goals faster while taking full advantage of the Oracle platform.\n\nVideo Highlights:\n00:48 Topics for today\n01:10 Upcoming Sessions\n02:40 Upcoming Sessions early 2022\n03:58 Regression Metrics: Agenda Outline\n04:17 Regression Metrics: Motivation\n04:51 Plot: Target vs Prediction\n07:06 Plot: Residual plot\n10:20 Mean Squared Error and Root Mean Squared Error\n11:45 Mean Absolute Error\n12:05 Experiment: MSE/RMSE vs MAE\n13:03 Discussion: Weight on Large Error\n16:17 R-Squared and Adjusted R-Squared\n19:45 Demo on OML Notebook \n25:13 Q&A"
