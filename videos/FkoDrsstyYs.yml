description: 'Immersive computing (AR and VR) will redefine the way we interact with information and experience the world. That''s why Google created Daydream for VR and Tango for AR. This talk will give developers an understanding of the two platforms, discuss opportunities for developers on each, discuss how Google can potentially partner with developers on projects, and most importantly talk about customer discovery of the content once it''s been created and approved to be published.'
