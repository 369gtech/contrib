title: 'Martin Gunnarsson, Pär Sikö "Introduction to JavaFX"'
recordingDate: 1358537672
description: 'Swing has been a great retainer for years, but with today''s focus on rich user interfaces, many Java applications can benefit from using JavaFX instead. The question is, how do you manage that when you''re stuck with a an old Swing front end? This presentation starts with a typical Swing application and replaces parts of it with a shiny new JavaFX interface. During this transformation event listeners are replaced by JavaFX bindings, hardcoded color constants are replaced by style sheets and instead of the limited HTML support in Swing, the JavaFX WebView component is used to display formatted content. After this presentation the audience will have a thorough understanding of how JavaFX can replace all or parts of a Swing user interface.'
