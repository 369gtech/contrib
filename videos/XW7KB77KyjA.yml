title: 'Writing {{''poems that change'', ''chance poems'', ''dynamic poetry''}}'
language: English
recordingDate: 1618868695
description: "Roses are red, violets are—purple? Blue? Why not both! {{‘The Blur Markup Language’, ‘BML’}} allows {{‘writers’, ‘authors’}} to {{‘make’, ‘write’}} text which is lazily evaluated, freeing them from the {{‘requirement’, ‘assumption’}} that their words have to exist in any one {{‘static’, ‘fixed’}} form. Unlike more open-ended text generation approaches, BML allows the creation of {{‘tightly’, ‘precisely’}} composed texts rich with surprises and possibilities. We’ll explore the motivations behind chance poetry{{‘ and BML,’, ‘’}} and see how it’s being used in {{‘the wild’, ‘action’}} from books to essays to installations.\n\nAndrew Yoon is making poems that change, live coding noise, playing melodica, growing the art journal nothing-to-say.org, and advocating for copyright abolition.
