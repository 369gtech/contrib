description: "One of the most exciting features of Java ME Embedded is the Peripheral I/O API, which provides relatively low-level access to peripheral devices. This session focuses on the implementation of the Peripheral I/O API for Oracle Java ME Embedded platform. It discusses the architecture and interesting details of implementation of the Peripheral I/O API and addresses the performance aspects of the platform and its expected latencies and throughput. The presentation demonstrates how an RTOS or Linux affects I/O performance and what else can have an impact on it, discusses useful programming practices, and offers some hints for Oracle Java ME Embedded developers. It also includes a couple of live real-world applications and demos.\n\n\nAuthor:\nSergey Nazarkin\n9-th years Oracle engineer, JDK DIO tech lead\nView more trainings by Sergey Nazarkin at https://www.parleys.com/author/sergey-nazarkin-1\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
