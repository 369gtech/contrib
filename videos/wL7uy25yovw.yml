description: "Type System plays an important role in building type-safe applications which reduce immense runtime exceptions and developer mistakes. \n\nThis sophisticated system is leverage by Scala's most famous functional libraries like Scala-Cats and ScalaZ. This feature-rich system allows pure Functional programming on JVM. It is a beast due to its complex syntax as it prevents developers to explore its beautiful aspects like partial types in Scala. \n\nIn this talk, we'd be taming the beast and use its beauty to solve real-life issues faced during coding. Our examples will be based on Generics, Constraints, Types Lambda, and Kind Projector plugin."
