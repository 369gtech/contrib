description: "Join Dylan Beattie - programmer, musician, and creator of the Rockstar programming language - for an entertaining look at the art of code. We’ll look at the origins of programming as an art form, from Conway’s Game of Life to the 1970s demoscene and the earliest Obfuscated C competitions. We’ll learn about esoteric languages and quines - how DO you create a program that prints its own source code? We’ll discover quine relays, code golf and generative art, and we’ll explore the phenomenon of live coding as performance - from the pioneers of electronic music to modern algoraves and live coding platforms like Sonic Pi.\n\n\nEVENT:\nBuild Stuff 2019\n\n\nSPEAKER:\nDylan Beattie\n\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nBuild Stuff Conference Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish Build Stuff videos."
