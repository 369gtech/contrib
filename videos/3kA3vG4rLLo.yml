description: "Adrian Catalan, Android GDE Beginner Design / UI/UX\n\nPARTY LIKE IT'S 1970: CONVERSATIONAL INTERFACES ARE BACK (INTO YOUR ANDROID APP)\nBeginner / Design / UI/UX / Talk\n\n\"Behold the promise land of AI. Machine learning has brought natural language processing right into our backyards and with it the possibilities of different ways of interaction such as conversations. But the challenges have evolved as recognizing the input can be done via an API (like DialogFlow) we also need to consider the interface and how to give an experience so natural that it seem like a human conversation. \"\"Oh hi how are you holding up? because I'm a potato\"\" it's not longer enough we need conversationally-enabled Android apps built with a different set of design concepts. In this talk we'll review examples of conversational interfaces, benefits of having one on your app, and the core principles for the design process of conversational experiences.\""
