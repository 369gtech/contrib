description: "Short version:\n\nResearchers from Bristol University have developed pioneering landslide modelling software which is used by governments in developing countries for disaster prediction and response planning. The software, input data and simulation results are currently managed in an ad-hoc manner and users typically lack the resources required to handle this effectively. We describe a collaboration between Bristol University's Geographical Sciences department and Particle Physics group, where techniques developed for the management and analysis of petabyte-scale datasets generated by the Large Hadron Collider are being applied to the problem of effective landslide modelling and risk reduction. A framework for hosting simulation software, based on the BigCouch fork of Apache CouchDB and the DIRAC workload management system, is being developed which provides features for managing complex input and output data and supports the parallel execution of simulations across a number of pluggable compute backends.\n\nMore Info: http://2011.berlinbuzzwords.de/content/landslides-couches-and-particle-physicists\n\nDescription of Michael Wallace:\nhttp://2011.berlinbuzzwords.de/content/michael-wallace"
