title: 'C# Dependency Injection with Autofac'
language: English
recordingDate: 1532952006
description: "Dependency Injection in C# can be a really confusing topic. Yet, when done right, Dependency Injection can be one of the best things you do for your application. It allows you to disconnect pieces of your application from each other easily and it allows you to test the various parts of your application independently. Today, I am going to get you started using Dependency Injection using a free tool called Autofac. We will take a small sample application and first apply the Dependency Inversion Principle (the D in SOLID). Then, we will wire up Autofac to handle connecting the various dependencies together.\n\nFull courses: https://www.iamtimcorey.com/\nSource Code: https://leadmagnets.app/?Resource=DependencyInjection\nPatreon: https://patreon.com/IAmTimCorey\nNewsletter signup:  https://signup.iamtimcorey.com/ \n\nSponsors:\nTuhafeni Angula (Patreon Subscriber)"
