description: "Leverage Existing Enterprise Data as Cloud Foundry Services - Robert Moss, Cloudsoft Corporation\n\nEnterprises have a wealth of data in pre-existing databases, which are ripe for developers to create new and exciting applications. Currently developers have to contact the database admin and request a new user account and register it as a user-provided service. The Cloudsoft Service Broker Manager allows an administrator to add service definitions for creating users to its service broker quickly. This means that developers can securely access existing enterprise data as reliable Cloud Foundry managed services. \n\nIn this presentation, Robert Moss will demonstrate how to add new service definitions using a form-based user interface. He will show how to create a service definition that provides Read-Only access to pre-existing SQL databases.\n\nRobert Moss\nRobert Moss is a Senior Software Engineer at Cloudsoft Corporation the makers of Cloudsoft AMP.
