description: "It is no longer possible to ignore the reach of JavaScript. Thanks to the web, JavaScript is one of the most widely distributed programming languages. Thanks to intense coporate competition between Google, Apple, and Mozilla, JavaScript engines are some of the fastest runtimes available. Yet JavaScript has many well known (and not so well known) shortcomings. This talk will discuss how JavaScript strengths can be leveraged and its costs mitigated via transpilation using ClojureScript as a specific example. \n\n\n\n\n\nLiked the song?
