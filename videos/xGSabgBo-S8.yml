Ближайшая конференция — DotNext\_2020 Piter\n15-18 июня, Online\nПодробности и билеты: https://bit.ly/dotnext2020piter\n\n. Автор настольной книги каждого .NET-разработчика и один из самых известных людей в мире .NET.\n\nToday's computer users are not willing to put up with application hangs and not knowing what the application is doing. Instead, they demand that applications be responsive and under their control at all times. Building applications that users can trust is a matter of using threads effectively especially in today's world of multi-core CPUs. Furthermore, users expect applications to run faster by taking advantage of all the computer's CPUs.\n\nIn this talk, Jeff will demonstrate the importance of performing asynchronous I/O to build responsive and highly-scalable applications that efficiently use system and application resources. The concepts discussed are applicable for building both client-side and server-side applications."
