description: "Generators were a compelling feature when added to Python 2.2 in seventeen years ago with PEP-255. When they were enhanced to become coroutines with PEP-342, they gained additional capabilities for modelling common problems.\n\nBut, surprisingly, we don't often see generators discussed as a core tool in the data scientist, computational scientist, and data engineer's toolkit. Why not?\n\nEVENT:\n\nPyData London 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nJames Powell\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nPyData Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video."
