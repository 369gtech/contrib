title: 'Scaling Spring Boot Applications in Real-Time'
language: English
recordingDate: 1538670974
description: "Building complex applications at scale, that are highly available, performant, and consistent is challenging. To do that, you need an application architecture built on a solid foundation that begins with Spring Boot and leverages the power of Spring Data and Apache Geode/Pivotal GemFire on Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF). We start as you would, at start.spring.io, and rapidly prototype an application from your IDE in a local environment. Then, we migrate the app to a managed environment on PCF in order to achieve reliable and secure data access at cloud scale. Finally, we wrap things up by summarizing the key design patterns for properly managing your data in a cloud-native environment.\n\nSpeakers:\nJohn Blum\nSoftware Engineering Principal, Pivotal\nLuke Shannon\nAdvisory Platform Architect, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
