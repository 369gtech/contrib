description: "Speaker: Raymond Tay\n\nHeard of Cats? It's not the musical nor the animal but it's a functional programming library that's modeled like Scalaz.\_ In this sharing session, Raymond will share what he learnt by writing systems using Cats and the OSS from Typelevel.org. In addition, he will also share his experience using Eff Monads: what they are, and what you can do with them. \n\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/Singapore-Scala-Programmers/events/240930589/\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/eJ6Z/"
