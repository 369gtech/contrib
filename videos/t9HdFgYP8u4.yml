They actually want give you their holy grail and apply for a login. And that's where it usually starts to go south. So many things can go wrong with a registration form that your customer doesn't really feel welcome or safe. In this session we will debug a few real-life examples from a user-experience Point of View. By analysing that we will find ways to make the first contact of a user with our application a better experience. And you don't need to be a coder to see why and how to improve your next registration form. \n\nRoom: K.4.601\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 15:00:00+01"
