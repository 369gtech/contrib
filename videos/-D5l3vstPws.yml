language: English
recordingDate: 1433261879
description: "Test-driven development is a game changer for developers, but behavior-driven development (BDD) is a game changer for the whole team. More than just a testing technique, BDD is both a collaboration and a verification tool—and a vital step on the road to continuous delivery. In this session, you will see BDD techniques applied to a real project with JBehave, Selenium 2, Thucydides, and more. Learn how to write better and more maintainable automated acceptance tests, and see how a well-designed set of automated acceptance criteria can also be a powerful documentation and reporting tool. And learn how product owners use BDD and Thucydides to drive, coordinate, and document releases.\n\n\nAuthor:\nJohn Ferguson Smart\nJohn is a well-regarded consultant, coach, and trainer in technical agile practices.
