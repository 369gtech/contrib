description: "Smart home automation is a growing and interesting M2M market. The Home Gateway Initiative standard, built around the combination of Java and OSGi, enables optimized development modularity, security, and an app store experience. Thus it enables an ecosystem for developers, service providers, and users. A successful home automation project addresses three key components: home gateway middleware, a smart home SDK, and remote management software. This session discusses all these parts and presents a complete end-to-end solution based on Prosyst’s home automation software and a real-life project done by one of Europe’s largest telcos. It concludes with a demonstration of an easy setup based on Raspberry Pi.\n\n\nAuthors:\nRainer Eschrich\nRainer Eschrich is a Master Principal Sales Consultant working for Oracle's Embedded Java Sales Organization.
