title: 'Run Programs Faster with GraalVM'
language: English
recordingDate: 1523991238
description: "Eric Sedlar\nVice President and Technical Director Oracle Labs\nOracle\n\nGraalVM is a new open source virtual machine technology and the world’s most polyglot execution environment: It can run JVM-based languages such as Java or Scala, JavaScript including node.js, Ruby, R, Python, and even LLVM-based languages such as C/C++. All languages execute with high individual performance and interoperability comes with zero performance overhead. GraalVM enables you to write a library in your preferred language and run it in applications from other languages, as well as allowing you to invoke library code from any language with the functionality you need. It is embeddable in other engines such as databases like Oracle and MySQL, or in SaaS applications like NetSuite as an extensibility layer. This allows GraalVM to execute with direct access to the data layer or other elements of your applications."
