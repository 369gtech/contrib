description: "In this presentation, we will be building a Sudoku Solver solely using Functional Programming idioms in Scala. This is a great opportunity to learn the very basics of Scala, the power of its built in Vector library and how it differs from what's built in Java 8.\n\nThe presentation will be structured as follow:\n\nQuick Introduction to Sudoku\nShort introduction to Scala and the concepts required for the Solver\nLet's get coding!\nWarning this talk has a lot of code\n\nCome even if you don't know Scala or even Functional Programming\n\nCesar Tron-Lozai \nI'm a full stack software engineer currently head of engineering in a small startup. I'm passionate about clean code, solving algorithmic problems and the java ecosystem in general. Due to my recent startup experience I had to learn about Dev Ops, especially the Docker echo system (running on Kubernetes) I'm fairly new to Scala and Pure Functional Programming but I love them and I'm keen to learn and explore!"
