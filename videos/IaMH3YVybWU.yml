description: "Applications are growing more complex. The back end may be microservices written in Java, Kotlin, and Go, while the front end may be JS. All these pieces are connected using gRPC. To make matters worse, the more people you add to a team, the slower everything gets. What if that wasn’t the way it had to be?\n\nIn this talk, we’ll follow a hypothetical team migrating to using Bazel for their builds, first locally, and then using distributed caching and distributed builds.\n\nYou’ll walk away with an understanding of how Bazel works, how it copes with a polyglot project, and how it can help speed up delivery. Of course, nothing is entirely perfect. You will also learn some of the pitfalls of using Bazel, and how you might be able to address them.\n\nAudience and level:\nAnyone interested in how a build works. Enthusiasm is more important than expertise!\n\nPresentation: https://disk.yandex.ru/i/eXtzwcJxBEzlNg\nCodeFest O! https://o.codefest.ru/lecture/1691"
