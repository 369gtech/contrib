description: "Recorded at SpringOne Platform 2016.\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/leadership-election-with-spring-cloud-cluster\n\nLeader election allows application to work together with other applications to coordinate a cluster leadership via a third party system. A leader can then be used to provide global state or global ordering, generally without sacrificing availability. In this presentation we show how Spring Cloud Cluster provides a simple abstraction for leader election and how it is implemented using zookeeper, hazelcast and etcd.  Note that 1.0.1 release deprecates everything in favour of code that now lives in Spring Integration."
