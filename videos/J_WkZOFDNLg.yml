description: "How to take advantage of enrichment initiatives and innovative classroom environments to enrich the computing curriculum\n\nClaire Wicher\n\nSunday 16th, 12:00 (Room D)\nEducation Summit talk for educators (Sunday, 25 mins)\n\nDespite the government's best efforts, students are being turned off when it comes to engaging with computer science. The number of students opting for the new Computer Science GCSE and A-Levels is lower than previous figures for ICT. In addition, the gender gap has widened.\n\nAs of 2017, 54% of UK schools were not even offering Computer Science as a GCSE option. With motivation for the subject low, student numbers declining and the digital skills gap increasing, a solution must be found to enthuse students and increase engagement with computing.\n\nI'll be introducing teachers to initiatives including after-school clubs, creative classroom projects and classroom displays that inspire and get students talking about the amazing and exciting side of computing to re-enter inspire and engage them with the subject we love.\n\n    The speaker suggested this session is suitable for teachers."
