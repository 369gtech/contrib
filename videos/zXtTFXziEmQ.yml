title: 'Security in Cloud-Native - Robin Minto'
recordingDate: 1533720302
description: "Cloud-native is an approach that fully exploits the advantages of the cloud - it's how you build and run your applications to allow easy scaling and continuous deployment. You may have seen the Twelve-Factor App methodology (https://12factor.net/) for developing applications that embrace a cloud-native philosophy but with that, there's little or no guidance on security.\nSecurity can't be an afterthought and cloud-native is no different. This talk looks at how to approach security for an app deployed to the cloud. Can you forget about infrastructure security? Where should you focus your attention? Is cloud-native more secure?\n\nWe'll consider the similarities and differences between traditional apps and cloud-native apps. We'll look at how you can avoid the most common security vulnerabilities that affect cloud apps and we'll look at approaches applicable to both Linux and Windows. You'll come away knowing how to be more secure in cloud-native."
