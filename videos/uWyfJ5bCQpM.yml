title: '"Unpacking History with Omeka" - Molly Tebo, Tricia McKenzie (LCA 2021 Online)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1612050297
description: "Molly Tebo, Tricia McKenzie\n\nhttps://lca2021.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/92/\n\nDuring lockdown, staff at the State Library of Western Australia worked on a novel suite of educational resources using the open source platform Omeka which was designed with GLAM organisations in mind. These resources were designed to align with the WA curriculum, to highlight collection materials and to extend the services that the State Library provides to schools in WA.\r\n\r\nPutting together sites of this nature can be very time consuming from a research perspective, so in many cases we re-used content from pre-existing websites made by previous staff at the State Library of WA. These websites have a wealth of valuable information, but the design and interface was old and unattractive. Rebuilding them on Omeka gave us a chance to update them and provide better metadata, tighter links to our catalogue, include content from Trove and innovative interactive elements such as a timeline. We will talk about the process of building these sites and how we used information and resources provided by others in the GLAM community. We would like to give a view under the hood and show how Omeka is quite friendly even for less technical users and can be used to enhance the online offerings of GLAM organisations of all sizes.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
