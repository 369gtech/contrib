description: "A clear-eyed look at distributed teams\nDistributed teams offer many benefits for employers and employees alike. Having a distributed team can make recruiting and retention easier, and it can help you build a diverse team. Depending on your circumstances, it might reduce costs, and it can improve productivity. As an employee, it offers increased flexibility, improved work-life balance, and broader employment opportunities.\n\nHowever, success with a distributed team requires changes to work practices and style — and not just from the remote employees. Even the people who still come to the office every day will experience changes, and team leads perhaps most of all. We think it’s a fabulous way to go, but it helps to be prepared … and most of what we see being written and discussed is focused on remote workers, not the organization that supports them.\n\nIn this talk, we will look at the challenges and rewards of working in a distributed team setting, with a focus on team leadership and management.\n\nABOUT MARIA GUTIERREZ\n\nMaria Gutierrez is VP of Engineering at FreeAgent, one of the UK’s largest and most popular, online accounting software providers.\n\nABOUT GLENN VANDERBURG\n\nGlenn Vanderburg is VP of Engineering at First.io, a North Carolina-based startup building software to amplify the effectiveness of residential real estate agents.\n\nGlenn and Maria each have many years of experience in the software industry, and worked together at LivingSocial where they led large, globally distributed teams from Dallas and Edinburgh, respectively. Both continue to manage remote workers at First and FreeAgent.\n\n--\n\n\nWhen you’re busy leading a team, coding and maintaining standards, how do you find the time to stay ahead of new technologies and develop yourself as a technical lead?\n\nThe Lead Developer conference features practical advice from experts on leading and motivating your team and high-level sessions on new and disruptive technologies.\n\nGet tickets at theleaddeveloper.com"
