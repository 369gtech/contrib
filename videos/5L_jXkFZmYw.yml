description: 'Serverless rocks the security boat. Ad-hoc servers we don’t manage rids us of certain security concerns, while the proliferation of cheap micro services raises others. In this talk, we’ll experience these security concerns live. We’ll break into a vulnerable Spring Cloud Function based application and exploit multiple weaknesses, helping you better understand the mistakes you can make, their implications, and how you can avoid them.'
