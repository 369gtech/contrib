language: English
recordingDate: 1517360403
description: "Let’s debunk the myth that you must keep teams stable or “the same” in order to have a successful company. Changing teams can help reduce the risk of attrition, learning & career stagnation, and the development of knowledge silos. I’ll share original case studies from well known companies that enable dynamic change to their teams propelled by retrospectives and other agile, humanistic practices. In this talk, you’ll learn tips and tricks for building a sustainable company by changing teams – whether it’s by growing and splitting teams, merging teams, seeding teams, adding new people across multiple teams and more. I’ll also share reteaming antipatterns and what not to do.\n\nHeidi brings a practitioner approach with 17 years coaching and influencing cross-functional teams. She is currently Director of Engineering Excellence at Procore Technologies in Carpinteria, California. Prior to that, she was an early employee at two highly successful startups from roughly 10 team members to 700. The first was ExpertCity, Inc. (acquired by CitrixOnline) where she was on the development team that invented GoToMyPC, GoToMeeting and GoToWebinar. After that she was Principal Agile Coach at AppFolio, Inc., a SAAS workflow software company that went public in 2015.\n\nFor more on YOW! conferences, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
