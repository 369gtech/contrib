title: 'Software and Database Refactor Patterns - Bill Penberthy - NDC London 2021'
language: English
recordingDate: 1624264692
description: "Many of us are working on enhancing and maintaining systems that have some longevity. Changing these systems in any meaningful manner is dangerous. I learned during my years as a consultant that one of the most common problems that companies have when trying to revitalize applications is understanding where to start. In this session we will talk about various software and database refactor patterns that are designed to limit that danger, ensure forethought and planning around any major refactoring efforts, and give confidence around the likelihood of success for a refactoring.\n\nWe will talk about various reasons for refactoring an application and discuss those patterns commonly used to support that refactor. As part of this discussion we will also talk about external factors, such as team size and experience, can affect the success around various pattern implementations."
