description: "Google I/O 2009 - GWT Can Do What?!?! A Preview of Google Web Toolkit 2.0\r\n\r\nBruce Johnson\r\n\r\nOne of the nicest things about working on an open source project is the atmosphere of community collaboration and brainstorming that it fosters. The GWT engineering team has been listening hard to the community about how GWT can be improved, and we're excited to take you on a tour of the powerful new features that have resulted. GWT 2.0 contains huge improvements, including dynamic script loading, a new catalog of compiler optimizations, and a new approach to hosted mode debugging that promises to revolutionize your productivity. Without a doubt, it will change the way you use GWT.\r\n\r\nFor presentation slides and all I/O sessions, please go to: code.google.com/events/io/sessions.html"
