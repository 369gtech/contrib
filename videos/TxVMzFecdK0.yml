The biggest change in this version is a focus on PWA and the usage of Web Components instead of GWT for the UI elements, and here come few questions: Why Web Components? How is that different for existing Vaadin Framework developers? What advantages does it give to web apps developers? In this BOF we will discuss those highlights, along with a few code examples to see how it works live on stage. Come ask all questions and wonders about the future of staying on the Java-side when writing front-end."
