description: "The full title of the speech is:\nUnleash the power of your data - data-driven transformation of your company\n\nSeveral trends have touched and reshaped our profession over the last years. We’re experiencing a new wave coming - one that heavily depends on you understanding how the data can be heavily used for building better products, more users friendly and focused on their needs, on the other hand - more automated and self-learning with precise results, like recommendations, feeds items that users love, a better protection from dangerous content and others.\n\nThe future requires two main ingredients - on the one hand, a company culture that embraces data-driven organization values and principles. The second one, from my personal experience, is not only building a robust data-oriented team to support the company. It’s about getting everyone on this journey. This means everyone in your teams understanding the power, and the limits, of the data you have, users need you to serve it to, and your business which needs to understand itself much better. We are becoming Software Developers 2.0.\n\nThe speech took on 8th May 2019 on DevTrends Stage during Infoshare 2019.\n#datadriven #AI #datatech"
