title: 'YOW! Nights May 2016 Michael Feathers - Symbiotic Design Practices'
language: English
recordingDate: 1464833697
description: "Decades ago, Melvin Conway coined what is now called Conway’s Law: “organizations which design systems ... are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations.”\n\nConway’s Law is a deep insight but it is only the tip of the iceberg when we try to understand the interaction between organization and software. We fail to appreciate that we can use team structure, day to day process, and the interface between business and development as levers to affect the quality of design and code.\nWith this perspective we can also see that concerns like technical debt and portfolio management lend themselves to new solutions when we understand software’s sensitivities upon its environment. \n\nIn this talk, Michael Feathers will outline practices organizations can use that are Conway-aware - and lead to more sustainable development.\n\nMichael Feathers is the Founder and Director of R7K Research & Conveyance, a company specializing in software and organization design. Prior to forming R7K, Michael was the Chief Scientist of Obtiva and a consultant with Object Mentor International. Over the past 20 years he has consulted with hundreds of organizations, supporting them with general software design issues, process change and code revitalization. A frequent presenter at national and international conferences, Michael is also the author of the book Working Effectively with Legacy Code (Prentice Hall, 2004).\n\nFor more on YOW!
