description: "Would you like to see Big Data use-cases implemented on Spark? Would you like to know what Spark is good at and what parts of Spark are tricky? \nFirst I would like to provide an overview of multiple Spark use cases. The number of use cases will be broad enough so it is likely you will be able to find similarities to projects you are working on and see how they can use Spark to solve problems and bring value to the company.\nThe second part of the presentation will be focused on technical challenges which need to be solved when introducing Spark to your ecosystem. \n\nThe speech took place on 8th May 2019 on DataTech Stage during Infoshare 2019."
