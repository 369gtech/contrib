description: "Шестая ежегодная конференция, посвященная разработке на Java. \n\nYegor Bugayenko\nFounder and CTO @ Teamed.io\n\nJUnit was designed with very little thinking about objects and their design. JUnit is very procedural. Can we fix that and make our tests object-oriented too? Yes, we can."
