We present a Scala library, which allows defining statically verified domain-specific languages (DSLs) for working with state machines. Our library enables the compile-time checking of the implementation of these DSLs, by encoding states into Scala types, and using an indexed free monad and a type class for restricting state transitions.\n\nRead the full abstract: http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2019/daniel-urban\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - DANIEL URBAN\nResearch Engineer at Nokia Bell Labs\n\nI'm a research engineer at Nokia Bell Labs, currently working on distributed systems with Scala. During this work, and sometimes in my free time, I occasionally contribute to open source Scala libraries (like shapeless or Cats).\n\nMore on Daniel Urban: http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2019/daniel-urban\n\n---\n\nLAMBDA DAYS & ERLANG SOLUTIONS\nLambda Days is powered by Erlang Solutions.
