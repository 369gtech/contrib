title: 'A practical approach to Java Memory Model with Andrzej Czarny'
language: English
recordingDate: 1526484492
description: 'Java Memory Model is an interesting area of multi-thread programming. It describes how threads interact through memory and what behaviours are allowed in concurrent execution. Most of java developers are familiar with mutual exclusion and synchronized keyword but sometimes we forget that beside mutual exclusion we also have to care about memory visibility. The talk will introduce number of examples to help understand JMM. It will use OpenJDK Java Concurrency Stress tests framework (JCStress) to validate the results.'
