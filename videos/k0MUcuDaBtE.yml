description: "Building your own software is definitely an attractive concept. The chance to have control and visibility over your very own product can feel like a no-brainer for the autonomous team that loves a challenge. \n\nBut with a challenge, comes risk. Your team may well have heard horror stories about what can go wrong if you don’t have the right foundations in place. \n\nIn this panel, we will discuss exactly what needs to be in place to kick-start your building journey - how to identify a common goal,  build your team of experts, and have the right resources in place to make your project a sure-fire success.\n\nKey takeaways\n\n- Planning structure and scope for a successful build journey\n- Learn to identify and approach risks and opportunities\n- How to mitigate the fall-out if things don’t go as planned\n- Managing a team to build successfully\n\nThis webinar is in partnerhip with Lohika"
