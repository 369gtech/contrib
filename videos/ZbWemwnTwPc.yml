description: "DevOps at American Express\n\nChad Avery, Director, Enterprise DevOps Program, American Express \nLee Barnett, Director, Automation, American Express \n\nDevOps is the next step in our transformation journey at American Express. We are one of the horses, a world class financial services company founded in 1850. Since 2011 we have been laying the foundations for DevOps by focusing on: developing our people, bringing in engineering skills, driving agile and toolchain automation adoption and co-locating our teams. We are now increasing our focus on shifting our service operations structure to improve availability and reduce service disruptions. This is our story so far.\n\nDOES17 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
