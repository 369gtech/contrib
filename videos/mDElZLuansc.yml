A community energizer at Agile Finland and one of the people behind recent Scan-agile and Tampere Goes Agile conferences. \n\nAntti is a designer at Kisko Labs working in and around the web. He is intrigued in making working between different talents and disciplines as smooth as possible. At work he dicovers new things about all things from web-frontend every day, at home he twists buttons and sliders to make synths sing. \n\nThis year Katja and Antti founded and made happen Finland's first front-end conference - Webshaped, which brought together design and development.\n\nThe way from idea to value. Simplified.\nHello, business person. Have a nice idea? But how to communicate it to software makers?\n\nHello, software maker. So you build things. But are you building the same thing the product owner thinks you are?\n\nIs it even the right thing to build?
