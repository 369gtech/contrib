description: "Full title: Li Jin, Hyonjee Joo: Spark Backend for Ibis: Seamless Transition Between Pandas and Spark | PyData New York 2019\n\nIbis a library that provides unified pandas-like API on top of both single-node local execution (e.g. pandas) and multi-node remote execution (e.g. BigQuery, Impala). In this talk, we will introduce a new backend for executing Ibis programs on Spark and show how you can write analytics that run on both Spark and pandas.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization.
