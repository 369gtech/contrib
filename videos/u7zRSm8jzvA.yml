description: "Talk recording from AmsterdamJS Conference 2017, June 8 https://amsterdamjs.com\n\nMichael Stanton, Software Engineer and Manager on the V8 Optimization team\n\nThe JavaScript language gets ever more powerful, but more complex to implement and deliver good performance. V8 has a new compiler pipeline and a unified approach to collecting feedback about your application. Iâ€™ll explain how we do it and present some problems. For example, in complex systems, facile \"solutions\" often distort the environment in unexpected ways. Welcome to the jungle *__*."
