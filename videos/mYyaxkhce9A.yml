title: 'Wix Engineering Podcast, episode 08: Onboarding through a Pandemic'
language: English
recordingDate: 1608635241
description: "Onboarding during a pandemic is difficult. Hiring good people, making them feel welcome and integrating them into an organization structure is a nightmare when you can only communicate on Zoom calls and over Slack.\n\nNo need to mention how crucial onboarding is impacting any company, but onboarding was also a challenge before COVID. Two years ago, Wix developers came up with a solution - a system to eliminate the isolation, the confusion, and sluggishness of integrating new people into the company, so that those people would feel at home right away."
