recordingDate: 1635128558
description: 'Have you used break! or IEX.pry, but curious how you would do that on a production node? Are you running a cluster of multiple nodes and want to be able to trace safely? This talk is for you, because we are going to cover tracing on Heroku and AWS. How that works under the hood, and ways you can safely trace and what you be careful of when do.'
