description: "Automated tests are vital in guarding us from introducing regressions into our products. Tests aren’t just sugar and cream. They come with a cost. Execution time. Tests Impact Analysis determines how relevant tests are. Help you reduce execution time to minimum focusing only on the tests that matter. I will talk about our journey of adopting the technique in a product safety guarded by over 50k automated tests. I will share with you the challenges we faced and how we solved them. What kind of improvements we were hoping for and how we reduced execution time of all tests, including WebDriver by 30%. Also what we learnt from the experiment and what are our plans for the future. I will show you how you can have Test Impact Analysis in your project using open source tools and what kind of strategy you’d follow to have it safely running in your pipeline. You will learn how we built our operational muscles as we were introducing Test Impact Analysis to pipeline.\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
