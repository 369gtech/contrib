If you are waiting for a deep dive into .NET Core, the Microsoft Compiler Platform and Unity3D this session is for you! No high-level tech demos, but a real-life application that is used in schools. Johnny will build an educational game, with robots fighting to the death, almost from scratch. This will include backend web services using .NET Core 3.1 with HTTP/2 and gRPC, a frontend Unity client to visualize the battle and middleware processing Worker Service using the Microsoft Compiler Platform (Roslyn). The point of this session is to show you how technology is evolved to make development easy and create useful applications in only one hour of hardcore coding!"
