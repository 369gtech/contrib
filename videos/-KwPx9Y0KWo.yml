description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM STO 19 http://bit.ly/2W2vgDC\n\nGet involved in Code Sync's next conference http://bit.ly/2Mcm4aS\n\n---\n\nBEAM FOR SMART ENERGY\nby Paul Valckenaers\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nErlang for \nSmart \nEnergy\n\nTALK LEVEL: Intermediate \n\nABSTRACT\nThis talk presents a case study applying Erlang in the energy domain.  Within STORY - a Horizon 2020 project - industrial automation and Erlang have been targeting energy storage installations. In industrial automation, an IT platform disruption is long overdue, and the pressure is rising continuously. When the disruption happens, Erlang, Elixir, the OTP, BEAM and ERTS represent unrivalled value. In STORY, embedded and networked digital twins - implemented in Erlang - demonstrate this.\n\nRead the full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/paul-valckenaers/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - PAUL VALCKENAERS\nFull time researcher on low and late commitment with early preparation. Design for the unexpected. Reality-centric IT architecture.\n\nPaul Valckenaers is a senior researcher at UCLL and KU Leuven, Belgium. He is the author of “Design for the Unexpected” (Elsevier) revealing how to build IT systems that are knowledgeable about a world-of-interest without imposing constraints in the application domain. He became addicted to the BEAM after discovering how small the semantic gap between reality and software becomes when you switch to Erlang/OTP and Elixir.\n \nPaul has applied his insights to manufacturing, supply networks, logistics, fleet robotics, agriculture, smart traffic, smart grids and healthcare. His designs provide a collective-predicting situation awareness for real-world activities executing on resources. They disclose what is possible. Undesirable courses-of-action are counter-acted by predicting their (lack of) performance.\n                                              \nPaul currently designs and implements embodied digital twins in STORY, a Horizon 2020 project on smart energy storage. These twins are digital co-workers that deliver in-depth interoperability by allowing to discover, observe and coordinate what is happening in energy installations.\n\nMore on Paul Valckenaers: https://codesync.global/speaker/paul-valckenaers/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM STO 19\nCode BEAM STO is powered by Code Sync.
