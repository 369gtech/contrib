description: "by Patrick Franken\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/AW1.125/fritzing.webm\n\n\nMaking electronics accessible to the broad public was mainly made possible by Arduino, the Raspberry PI and last but not least Fritzing. Back in 2009 it was a pain to get from a loose wiring on a breadboard to a PCB. Fritzing came up first with a unique breadboard view and a simple to use PCB layout.\nFast forward 10 years Fritzing is still widely used by over 200.000 users but struggles to find a sustainable way to fund its development. \n\nThis talk will give a rough introduction to Fritzing including its strength and weaknesses and introduce a roadmap for its further development. TBD \n\nRoom: AW1.125\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 12:00:00+01"
