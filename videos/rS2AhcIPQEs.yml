language: English
recordingDate: 1638844568
description: "tanzu.tv/tt/74\n\nAt conception, Kubeapps was created as a Kubernetes application dashboard designed with the only packaging format of the time in mind: Helm charts. As the Kubernetes landscape for packages has grown, we needed an extensible way to expand Kubeapps to support new packaging formats such as declarative Flux resources, Carvel bundles and other future packaging formats. In this session you’ll learn about current technical limitations and how the team is overcoming them by designing a plugins-based, extensible, clear API boundary.\n\n---\n\nMiguel Martinez is a technical lead at VMware where he focuses on the scalability and automation of VMware Software Supply Chain, as well as evolving the cloud-native content distribution platform for the VMware Marketplace. Prior to VMware, Miguel worked as full stack engineer in all-things-cloud at Bitnami and co-founded the first Spanish startup to go through the YCombinator program. Currently living in San Francisco, where he enjoys Mexican food, rock climbing and re-runs of “The IT Crowd”.\n\nAntonio Gámez Díaz is currently pursuing a PhD in Software Engineering from the University of Seville (2021), after a shift from the academia to the technology industry in 2020. Antonio joined VMware and now helps the community to deploy applications in the cloud with Kubeapps, a completely open-source project. His research interests in Software Engineering are focused on Service-Oriented Computing, specifically on RESTful systems governance using SLAs. In the past, he has participated in several research projects and has collaborated with leading organizations such as the OpenAPI Initiative or GitHub Education for the technological and industrial knowledge diffusion. Currently, he actively participates in the VMware Multicloud Academy, an initiative to bring the technological background at VMware closer to our university undergrads."
