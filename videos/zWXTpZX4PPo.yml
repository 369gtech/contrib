description: "This tutorial aims to provide some examples of how to write effective Bayesian programs using TensorFlow and Tensorflow Probability. In TFP land, effectiveness usually comes from writing model that could generate batch-able functions, and utilizing modern hardware (GPU, TPU) with compiler accelerator (i.e., XLA). I will give a walkthrough on how to do so and highlight some gotchas.\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
