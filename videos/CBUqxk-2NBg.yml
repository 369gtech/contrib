description: "Speaker: Harald Zeitlhofer, Dynatrace\n\nYour PHP web application might be running flawlessly in a development environment, and even after deploying into production there might be no major issues. But then traffic increases, and just as you really need a reliable system, it slows down or even crashes? Sounds familiar? Well, it doesnâ€™t have to be like that. Proper scaling of your application can easily avoid that. In this session we will talk about best practices for designing and configuring modern PHP applications in terms of performance and scalability. We will cover topics like frontend design, web server, PHP environment, application design, database usage and caching.\n\n*Harald Zeitlhofer* has 15+ years of experience as an architect and developer of enterprise ERP solutions and web applications with a main focus on efficient and performant business processes, usability and application design.
