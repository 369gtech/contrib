description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM V 2020 - https://codesync.global/conferences/code-beam-sto/\n\nDon t write NIFs (at least not in C) | Sonny Scroggin - Staff Software Engineer AT Royal.io\n\nABSTRACT\nTALK LEVEL: BEGINNERS / INTERMEDIATE / PROFICIENT\nMost experienced Erlangers will caution against writing NIFs, and for good reason! NIFs are notoriously dangerous.\n\nNot only do we have to worry about crashing the BEAM, but we run the risk of degrading the scheduler if we're not careful. But what if writing NIFs were safe?\n\nIn this talk, Sonny will discuss Rustler, a library which makes it incredibly simple to write safe NIFs in Rust.\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS\nNative\n\nSafety\n\nPerformance\n\nOBJECTIVES\nThis talk aims to inspire people to learn Rust and how to leverage it within their current BEAM applications.\n\n• Follow us on social: \n  Website: https://codesync.global/conferences/code-beam-sto/\n  Twitter: https://twitter.com/CodeBEAMio\n\n• Looking for a unique learning experience?\n  Attend the next Code Sync conference near you! \n  See what's coming up at: https://codesync.global \n\n• SUBSCRIBE TO OUR CHANNEL\n  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC47eUBNO8KBH_V8AfowOWOw"
