recordingDate: 1334896359
description: "This webcast covers both the threat and the promise presented to professional journalism by citizen journalism, social networking, and other crowdsourcing. We'll look at some of the proposals made by leaders in journalism to modernize the practices, and go through a \"thought experiment\" that asks how far social networking and rating systems could replace professional news sources. We will end by summarizing ways journalists could incorporate more crowdsourcing into their work.\n\n\nAbout Andy Oram:\n\nAndy Oram is an editor at O'Reilly Media, a highly respected book publisher and technology information provider.
