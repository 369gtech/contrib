description: "This talk was presented during the React Native EU 2021 - the largest community conference in the world focused exclusively on React Native.\n\nAbstract:\nThere are multiple solutions if you want to work with animations in React Native. Each solution has its advantages and disadvantages. In this talk, you will get to know Animated, Reanimated 2, and Lottie, each solution with detailed code examples and recommended use cases for this solution. We will animate Image list headers with scale, translate and change opacity using Animated, change the height, position, and opacity onScroll using Reanimated 2 and use code-controlled Lottie-Animations to animate characters. You will not only learn how to create such beautiful animations but also how to do it that they run at 60fps on every device. \n\nABout the speaker:\nAlexander is the owner of Horizon Alpha. He loves working on awesome React Native apps and the corresponding cloud-based backends.\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AlexanderKuttig"
