description: "The HTML5 juggernaut is radically changing client-side development on mobile devices as well as the desktop. Given the pervasiveness of HTML5, where does JavaFX fit in the picture? This presentation examines both HTML5 and JavaFX, covering the technical strengths and weaknesses of each. This is a code-intensive session with comparison code and examines the differences between JavaFX and HTML5 animation support, rendering capabilities, and performance. In addition, it covers how JavaFX can leverage HTML5 to get the best of both worlds.\n\n\nAuthors:\nRyan Cuprak\nundefined\nView more trainings by Ryan Cuprak at https://www.parleys.com/author/ryan-cuprak\n\nMichael Finocchiaro\nCurrently Senior Director of the 3DEXPERIENCE Platform including sales, pre-sales, communication, marketing, advertising, and other aspects required for promoting this critical transformation of the DS Solution Portfolio.
