description: "Most well known mobile architectures start to work against you after your engineering team grows large. A new architecture paradigm is needed to support the development of mobile applications with hundreds of mobile engineers.\n\nAfter investigating all other mobile architectures, Uber created RIB's, a platform-agnostic novel mobile architecture designed with reliability, testability, isolation and maintainability in mind. In this talk, you'll learn about the motivation to create an entirely new mobile architecture, the process that let us re-write the Uber application in 3 months with 200 engineers and an overview of the architecture itself.\n\n# Tuomas Artman\nTuomas is the tech lead for Uberâ€™s mobile architecture and frameworks team. Prior to moving to the Bay area five years ago, he founded one of Finlands leading digital consultancy and spent a year in Shanghai building games and multiuser technology platforms for the Chinese market."
