description: "Video from Devoxx Poland 2019.\n\nIn this talk you can learn about LinkedIn's approach to scaling AI and ML systems. We have been applying AI in our products for well over a decade now. Still, the productivity of ML engineering can still be improved. In addition, we want to make it easy for any engineer from any LinkedIn product group to leverage ML. This requires a framework that provides great dev experience for all phases of ML workflow: exploration and authoring, training, deploying and running in production."
