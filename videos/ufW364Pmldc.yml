description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2019 by Fabien Devos, Wealthfront.\n\nMore info: http://androidmakers.fr/schedule/?sessionId=RBP-6855\n\nYou've been working as an engineer for a while, and now you want more. More responsibilities, more decision making power, more money. But where do you even start? Become an engineering manager right? Not so fast. \n\nIn this talk, we'll go over how to choose the best career path for you. There are many ways of becoming the leader you know you deserve to be, and not all of them are obvious nor conventional. We'll cover the different options and the skills required to get there, but we'll also talk about why not to become a manager, or even a tech lead.\n\nFinally, you decide to make the jump. You \"made it\" right? But, now what? How to become the best leader you can possibly be? How to give constructive feedback? How to set expectations with your people? And what's next? Keep climbing?... or choose to go back to building.\n\nAlex Karp Production"
