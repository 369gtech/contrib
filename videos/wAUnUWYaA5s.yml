description: "http://www.Cppcon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2016\n—\nIn 1997, the MAME project was started as a DOS application written in C. Initially it could emulate a single arcade game, but today we have over 30,000 games. During the years, the code base grew but until 2009, there were no big steps. Then we started using C++.  \n\nThis case study will show how moving from C and plain C++ to modern C++ benefited both developers and end users, how we got better compatibility and portability, and better code. We will also discuss libraries that we feel are missing from the standard and the libraries that we are sharing with the community. \n— \nMiodrag Milanovi?\nSoftware Architect, Levi9\nBorn in 1978. Bachelor of Computer Science, work as wide-range developer in local company, for some years as C++ development for various international customers. From 2012 coordinator of MAME emulation project, pushing hard in modernization of two decade old code.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
