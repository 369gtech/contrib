description: "Supercharging Your Code With Five Little-Known Attributes by Jackson Lewis\n\nAttributes are one of the most useful and convenient features in the Rust language, enabling programmers to auto-derive traits, set up a test suite in minutes, and conditionally compile code for different platforms. But there are many other useful attributes, both inside and outside of the standard library, that often go unnoticed. Join us as we go through five attributes you might not know about - and how you can use them to both optimize and strengthen your code."
