Cloud native microservices-based applications can provide the agility and increased productivity needed. However, most IT operations are overwhelmed with the changing cloud native technology landscape. One option is to build your own cloud native environment from open source software. But, that requires dealing with the complexity of picking the right software and getting it all to work together, without any vendor support. The other approach is to use a stack or distribution from a software vendor. This option offers support but that could mean lock-in with that vendor, which may also not be up to date with the latest technologies. The speaker will demonstrate a better alternative—one that can give you the best of both worlds by delivering software that supports the open standards, specifications, and APIs defined by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation® (CNCF®). \n\nhttps://sched.co/dINh"
