description: "Highly Available Cloud Foundry on Kubernetes - Vlad Iovanov, SUSE\n\nIn this talk the presenters will present how SUSE Cloud Foundry is deployed and configured to run in a highly available fashion. We will show how we avoid SPOFs using Kubernetes features like stateful sets, readiness and liveness probes, etc. Furthermore, we will show how the end user of SCF can deploy applications without worrying about downtime. The presentation will include a demo of a disruptive agent simulating failures across the Kubernetes nodes and containers, while user applications are still live and healthy.\n\nAbout Vlad Iovanov\nVlad Iovanov is currently working as a Technical Lead on the SUSE Cloud Foundry project at SUSE. He has given various talks in industry for topics ranging from Container technologies, Windows framework and Best practices for Application Development."
