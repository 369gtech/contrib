description: "Property-based tests have the false reputation of being for functional programmers only & for doing “Mathy”-stuff only.\n\nLet‘s break that: Your business domain is rich in properties that you can test in Java!\n\nLet‘s dive in so next monday you‘ll use properties to: - write fewer tests, with less boilerplate, that test more - Reduce your test technical debt - Write tests that document your business rules explicitly - Find your business domain invariants and guide your design.\n\nRomeu Moura\nWriter of tales – on art, puzzles & crafts – to friends & compilers. Likes dialectics, paradigm jumping, serendipity, endless conversations.\n\n[TPV-3975]"
