description: "# A quick masterclass in Git, hosted by our very own Dom Davis and supported by the nor(DEV): community\n\n## What is Git?\n\nVersion control systems are a category of software tools that help a software team manage changes to source code over time. Version control software keeps track of modifications to the code in a special kind of database.\n\nGit is the most widely used version control system (aka VCS) in the world. Git is also actually an example of a distributed version control system (aka DVCS) - rather than have only one single place for the full version history of the software as is common in once-popular version control systems like CVS or SVN, in Git, every developer's working copy of the code is also a repository that can contain the full history of all changes.\n\nGit, isn't just for software source code though. It can be used to track changes in a variety of formats and processes:\n\n- Technical Lead? Track specifications and documentation with fine-grain control over revisions\n- Data Science? Track changes to your Jupyter Notebooks, and share them easily\n- Design? Git will track those binary files for you too. Plugins are also available to provide impressive diffing capabilities on them too with onion skinning etc.\n- Law? https://github.com/JesseKPhillips/USA-Constitution/\n- Research Papers? Share those discoveries in a collaborative format and invite feedback\n\n## Agenda\n\n- Helping those new to it, understand what it is\n- Helping those who just follow the incantations, understand why\n- Helping teach the more experienced a trick or two... hopefully\n\nThis session is going to be a collaborative session, to kick us off, Dom will introduce git, initialising a project and demonstrate a simple commit & push workflow. Then onto the world of \"Git with Others\", where we'll demonstrate some collaborative workflows with branching, merging, pull requests and conflict resolution (the code kind, not the personal ones, see our last event for that).\n\nWe'll then move into an AMA, Q&A, LeanCoffee format - this is an opportunity to explore some QoL improvements you may be using. Ask questions and explore how others in the community are using Git day-to-day and to deliver software efficiently and in parallel.\n\nRSVP, Read more, or grab a Zoom link on Meetup https://www.meetup.com/Norfolk-Developers-NorDev/events/272038029/"
