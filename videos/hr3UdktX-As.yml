description: "This video was recorded at Scala Days Copenhagen 2017\nFollow us on Twitter @ScalaDays or visit our website for more information http://scaladays.org \n\nAbstract: \nCAUTION: If you are responsible for an Akka system deployed to production, attending this talk may cause intense moments of self-doubt, stress and possibly panic.\n\nAkka is a toolkit for building highly concurrent and distributed applications on the JVM using the actor model. Given the prevalence of frameworks over toolkits and models in the industry, it is easy to forget that the former will not prevent you from using them in any way you please â€“ including ways that are possibly suboptimal or perhaps even harmful.\n\nIn this talk you'll learn about a few of the most common anti-patterns related to Akka usage. You'll also get to know about alternative and more appropriate solutions to use for each one of those anti-patterns. It should be noted that these suboptimal uses of Akka are not merely theoretical ponderings but real and recurring observations that the speaker made during a range of consulting projects."
