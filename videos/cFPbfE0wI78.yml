description: "by John Sullivan\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/H.1308/js_love_it.webm\n\n\nThe vast majority of JavaScript carries no license or copyright notice at all, often because of concerns about optimizing bandwidth and speed, but also because of a lack of awareness. As JavaScript developers, you are well-positioned to help solve this problem -- by clearly licensing your code, by making improvements to the common tooling, and by providing important feedback on what licensing methods make the most sense. The lack of clear licensing info, especially when combined with\nminification, makes most JavaScript proprietary for the users who\nreceive and execute it in their browsers, even if the source code is\navailable elsewhere on the Internet in some repository under a free\nlicense. The lack also means rampant license violations, for both\npermissively and reciprocally licensed code. The Free Software\nFoundation has proposed and implemented a couple of licensing metadata\nmethods by which JavaScript which is intended to be free software can\nclearly say so, and therefore actually respect the freedom of its\nusers. This is the first step in compliant and realistic distribution\nof copyleft-licensed JavaScript, as well as a step toward allowing\nfree software users to run only free software inside the browser as\nthey do outside the browser. Other approaches have been proposed as\nwell. We will discuss these questions and seek input on the approaches\nso far, and hopefully leave with some momentum to make positive\nchanges. \n\nRoom: H.1308 (Rolin)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 09:00:00+01"
