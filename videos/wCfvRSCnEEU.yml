recordingDate: 1433508209
description: "The Oracle Java ME Embedded runtime on Freescaleâ€™s Kinetis line of microcontrollers (MCUs) enables a vast variety of use cases. The Kinetis MCU families, based on the ARM Cortex M architecture, provide exceptionally low-power performance, memory scalability, a rich set of peripheral connectivity, and security features. Oracle Java ME Embedded on Kinetis MCUs can enable high-performance Java ME applications for remote manageability of devices and applications, I/O programmability, and secure peripheral access for mission-critical use cases. This session includes a demo of Oracle Java ME Embedded on a Kinetis K70 MCU.\n\n\nAuthors:\nMichael Norman\nNo bio available\nView more trainings by Michael Norman at https://www.parleys.com/author/michael-norman\n\nRenu Motwani\nRenu is a member of Oracle's Java Product Management Team.\nView more trainings by Renu Motwani at https://www.parleys.com/author/renu-motwani\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
