title: 'Writing Cross Platform Games with MonoGame and .NET - Stephen Haunts - NDC London 2021'
language: English
recordingDate: 1624522289
description: "Writing games is fun. Writing games also makes you think in a different way to normal web development, or the development of enterprise software. Even though we have fantastic game engines like Unity, Godot, and Defold; as a C# and .NET Developer, it is sometimes fun to go a little lower level and write the engine yourself.\n\nIn this talk, I will show you how the MonoGame framework works, and how your application is structured differently to what you might expect in web development. I will also introduce you to a small 2D game engine I have developed called ExoGame2D that sits on top of MonoGame.\n\nI will cover the following topics.\n\n- The premise of a game loop\n- Separating rendering from the game logic\n- Using the MonoGame asset pipeline\n- Creating a scene graph\n- Rendering sprites and animated sprites\n- Font rendering\n- Bounding volume and pixel-perfect collision detection\n- Game state management\n- Rendering user-interface controls\n- Game engine messaging systems\n- Keyboard, Mouse and Gamepad controllers\n\nGame development is all about having fun, and using a simple game engine allows you to experiment with ideas quickly and efficiently."
