description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io\_The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nHigh Density, Cloud Native Android in Kubernetes - Bin Yang & Chao Xie, Intel \n\nAndroid have been spread to some use cases such as cloud and edge computing. One example is Android Cloud gaming, which runs many Android instance in Cloud and streaming encoded video to remote devices. This use case requires a solution to consolidate many Android runtime into single platform with little overhead, strong isolation and lessen management overhead. This presentation proposes an innovate idea to run Android in Container to fit for the uses case of cloud computing and edge computing. Trough enhancement docker and Kubernetes, millions of Android instances are deployed and managed on Cloud easily. Prometheus is used to monitor the status of Android instance and managed instance simultaneously. Performance data show its impressive performance and good scalability. \n\nhttps://sched.co/cp8c"
