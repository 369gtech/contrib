description: "From OSCON 2014: Keynote by Wendy Chisholm, Senior Accessibility Strategist and Universal Design Evangelist, Microsoft, entitled  \"Introvert? Extrovert? Klingon? We've Got You Covered.\"\n\nAbout Wendy Chisholm (Microsoft):\nI am an author, activist and project manager. I co-wrote \"Universal Design for Web Applications\" with Matt May (O'Reilly, 2008) and edited Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 and 2.0--the basis of most web accessibility policies. I have appeared as Wonder Woman in a web comic with the other HTML5 Super Friends and as myself in interviews on Minnesota Public Radio, Puget Sound Public Radio, and at Ignite Seattle. In November 2009, I was the Seattle PI's Geek of the Week.\n\nI've focused on universal design since 1995. Being both a developer (B.S. in Computer Science) and a Human Factors Engineer (M.S. in Industrial Engineering/Human Factors), I bridge communication between developers and designers. As a Senior Strategist at Microsoft, I help make Bing services and apps accessible.\n\nWatch more from OSCON, O'Reilly's open source convention: http://goo.gl/HlGwvP\nFind out more about the convention: http://oscon.com\n\nDon't miss an upload!
