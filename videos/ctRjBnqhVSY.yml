description: "by Daniel Kiper\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/K.3.401/grub_upstream_and_distros.webm\n\n\nThe presentation will discuss current state of GRUB upstream development and cooperation with distributions. The first half of presentation will be focusing on last year and current\ndevelopment efforts. The second half will discuss cooperation between GRUB\nupstream and distros. In general it will show current progress in the project\nand main pain points. One of the goals of the presentation is to solicit some\nhelp from the community. Maintainers are quite busy and they are not able to\nsolve all issues themselves. So, help from others is greatly appreciated. At\nthe end of presentation Q&amp;A session is planned. \n\nRoom: K.3.401\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 10:50:00+01"
