description: "DOES18 Las Vegas — Despite the undisputed advantages of adopting a DevOps culture, adhering to its principles in a day-to-day work environment demands a lot of discipline and alignment. You may have had great success getting your transformation off the ground, even if only in a few teams, but with looming business deadlines and decisions, maybe the effort has stalled out. Worse yet, perhaps you are seeing a relaxing of those beloved principles. So how do you make positive change “stick” when confronted with unforeseen turbulence, such as a sudden change in leadership and/or direction. Pauly Comtois will share a framework that he has been using in over 20 organizations and 4 years. It’s a blend of organizational behavior and clear, value-driven business goals to allow this framework to achieve success without causing burnout or disenfranchisement.
