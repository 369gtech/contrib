Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nSIG Usability: Unifying the Experience for the Kubernetes User - Gaby Moreno Cesar, IBM & Pamel Shinh , VMware \n\nSIG Usability is focused on the core end-user usability of the Kubernetes project. This includes efforts in user research, internationalization, and accessibility. We will be going over some of the SIG's initiatives, opportunities to get involved, as well as diving into the topic of what makes up a usability contribution? Pulling from the field of cognitive science, we will present some well-established usability and software experience principles that both code and non-code contributors can use to expand the types of contributions they make to open source projects.\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zeue"
