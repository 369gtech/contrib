description: "Supporting FOSS Community Members with Impostor Syndrome Mentoring and supporting peers with impostor syndrome\nby Sage Sharp\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/UB5.132/community_supporting_foss_community_members_imposter_syndrome.webm\n\n\nThis talk will share knowledge of how to support people who experience impostor syndrome, especially people from groups underrepresented in Free Software. Many people from groups underrepresented in open source experience impostor syndrome. Impostor syndrome is the combination of unrelenting standards for yourself and a fear of people finding out that you're not knowledgeable or experienced, that you're a fake, an impostor. People from groups underrepresented in tech have to work twice as hard to receive recognition as people who don't face discrimination, which often leads to impostor syndrome. Women and ethnic/racial minorities are much more likely to face impostor syndrome. If Free Software is to become more diverse, the community needs to understand how to support people who experience impostor syndrome. \n\nMost of the articles and training around impostor syndrome focus on changing the person who experiences impostor syndrome. What if instead, we focused on how the Free Software community could support people who experience impostor syndrome? How do we support our peers with impostor syndrome? How do we mentor someone with impostor syndrome? How do we acknowledge the work of community members who face impostor syndrome in a way that doesn't trigger the feelings of \"I'm not good enough\"? \n\nSage Sharp will draw on their experience working with the Outreachy internship program to provide tips for how to support people with impostor syndrome. Despite being a Linux kernel developer for seven years and a Diversity and Inclusion consultant for three years, Sage often personally struggles with impostor syndrome. Their talk will draw on personal experience and provide examples of what has worked for Outreachy mentors who work with people from groups underrepresented in tech. \n\nRoom: UB5.132\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 09:10:00+01"
