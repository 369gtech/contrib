description: "Latency and Availability Error Budgets Done Right at Scale\n\nFred Moyer, Zendesk\n\nLearn how Zendesk developed formulas for implementing SLIs, SLOs, and Error Budgets at scale across a team of 1,000 engineers.\n\nError Budgets tell us when we should stop working on features and instead work on reliability.

How do you empower 1,000+ engineers to solve these problems correctly in systems at scale?\n\nView the full SREcon20 Americas program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon20americas/program"
