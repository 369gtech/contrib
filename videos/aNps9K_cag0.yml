description: "DOES19 Las Vegas — The discussion of the importance of transformational leadership in DevOps adoption has been a recurring theme at the DOES conferences since 2016 when it was first introduced to this audience by Dr. Steve Mayner. These critical leader behaviors have also proven to be predictive of high performing organizations according to the research conducted by DORA and reported in the last two State of DevOps reports. At the 2018 conferences, Dr. Mayner demonstrated in interactive sessions that these leader behaviors can be learned by anyone with a desire to improve their abilities as a leader.\n \nIn 2019 we raise the bar one more time. In this session Dr. Mayner will be joined by Joe Hunt, Group Vice President of Software Engineering and Architecture for Charter Communications, one of the largest media and entertainment companies in the country. Joe found the transformational leadership conversation from past DOES videos as a promising pattern for building a new leadership culture for his group at Charter, and partnered with Dr. Mayner to coach his organization through their leadership learning journey. Joe will describe the business challenges that led him to launch this leader development initiative, what their successes and lessons learned have been, and what hurdles remain on their path ahead. \n\nDOES19 Las Vegas\nDOES 2019 US\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
