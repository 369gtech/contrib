description: "The world is using technology more than ever before. This means running billions of applications on computers somewhere on the planet but as someone who is concerned for the environment what does that mean?\n\nIf I pick microservice architecture over monolithic on the cloud, does that save electricity?\n\nAll cloud hosting companies have their own data centres but if you take cost out of the equation what cloud provider is doing the most to save energy and therefore the planet?\n\nThis talk will give you a brief look into how these data centres work and the impact they have on the environment.\n\nJamie is a software developer and Evangelist for WebSphere Application Server and Open Liberty based at IBM’s R&D Laboratory in Hursley, UK. He is a subject matter expert in Docker and takes a keen interest in emerging technologies with experience in Maven, git, Jenkins and microservice architecture. He has worked on a wide variety of projects such as modernising CICS mainframe testing infrastructure, creating and automating the creation of Docker images for WebSphere, contributing to the microservice Builder offering and creating web applications for events at the Lab."
