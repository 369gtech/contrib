Not for much longer. New language and library developments make it possible to handle exceptions in a declarative manner, leading to drastic code simplification.\n\nThis talk discusses an alternative approach to handling exceptional flow that eliminates the need for small ancillary RAII classes, try/catch statements that rethrow, and other cleanup mechanisms. The popular Scope Guard idiom gets a spectacular generalization. Statements specify in a declarative manner actions to be taken if the current scope is left normally or via an exception. The resulting code is simpler, smaller, and easier to maintain.\n— \nAndrei Alexandrescu is a researcher, software engineer, and author. He wrote three best-selling books on programming (Modern C++ Design, C++ Coding Standards, and The D Programming Language) and numerous articles and papers on wide-ranging topics from programming to language design to Machine Learning to Natural Language Processing. Andrei holds a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Washington and a BSc in Electrical Engineering from University \"Politehnica\" Bucharest. He works as a Research Scientist for Facebook.Website: http://erdani.comTwitter handle: @incomputable\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
