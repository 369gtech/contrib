title: 'Steven Lembark - ‎Getting testy with Perl‎'

description: "Perl testing is kind of like swimming in the ocean: it's fun to start with but gets deep pretty quickly. Even if Test::Simple does most of the work, you'll eventually have a reason to dive into deeper waters. So, think of this talk as a glass bottomed boat: it gives you a chance to see things without getting bit or drowning...\nThe talk covers basics of perl testing along with mock objects and functions, using prove, filesystem-driven bulk tests and generic test modules, and ways to exercise objects in bulk.\nThe point of this all is to have a better feel of what can be done and where to look when the time comes."
