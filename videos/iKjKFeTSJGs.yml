description: "Avoiding Goodhart's Law - Use SLO's as Tools Not Cudgels\n\nMarco Coulter, AppDynamics\n\nThe concepts of SLI, SLO, and Error Budgets are there to balance risk (rates of change) and reward (business contentment). Using such metrics as red lines to punish teams, or force acceptance of risk by the business is missing the point. Experiences from SLA's in-service contracts inform a conversation identifying that SLI, SLO, and Error Budgets are better as a basis for conversations about the stress an application can withstand. This must include the business stress, as well as the infrastructure stress.\n\nThis session takes Goodhart's law from economic policy as a frame for reconsidering SLI's and SLO's. Leave this session inspired to approach your SLO negotiations in the best possible way.\n\nView the full SREcon20 Americas program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon20americas/program"
