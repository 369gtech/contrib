title: 'Using CredHub for Kubernetes Deployments'
language: English
recordingDate: 1538632680
description: "Storing sensitive data, such as certificates and passwords, is critical for any deployment. CredHub has proved to be a working solution for such a purpose both on Pivotal CF and open-source Cloud Foundry. CredHub can store encrypted data, providing it to services, apps, and end users, as well as ensure its rotation. We do think using CredHub is a good practice not only for open-source Cloud Foundry and Pivotal CF, but for managing data in Kubernetes clusters, as well.\n\nSpeakers:\nPeter Blum\nPlatform Architect, Pivotal\n\nEugene Kiselev\nCloud Foundry DevOps Engineer, Altoros\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
