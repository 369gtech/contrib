description: "Ways to Monitor your BOSH Director - Beyhan Veli, SAP SE\n\nThe BOSH Team Europe at SAP operates BOSH as a service for operators and the Cloud Foundry on-demand service brokers. Like every production service, the expectations to BOSH's performance and availability have increased dramatically.\n\nMotivated by concrete issues in our production BOSH services, we have continuously worked on identifying the useful metrics and making them available to monitoring tools. No one likes to be paged and that is why it was a crucial task for us to improve the BOSH monitoring.\n\nIn this talk we share some of our operation war stories and the metrics which we identified to prevent these situations as well as some ways to expose those metrics to monitoring tools. Moreover, we will give an update on all the improvements implemented for BOSH to make a more sophisticated monitoring possible.\n\nAbout Beyhan Veli\nBeyhan is a developer in the BOSH Team Europe. He is a committer on the BOSH project for over 3 years now. Before that he was working on different topics for the SAPâ€™s Cloud Platform.\n\nhttps://www.cloudfoundry.org/"
