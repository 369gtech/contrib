Moreover, the scope of decisions delegated to machine learning systems seems likely only to expand in the future. Unfortunately serious discrimination, privacy, and even accuracy concerns can be raised about these systems. Many researchers and practitioners are tackling disparate impact, inaccuracy, privacy violations, and security vulnerabilities with a number of brilliant, but often siloed, approaches. This presentation illustrates how to combine innovations from several sub-disciplines of machine learning research to train explainable, fair, trustable, and accurate predictive modeling systems. Together these techniques can create a new and truly human-centered type of machine learning suitable for use in business- and life-critical decision support. - Captured Live on Ustream at https://www.ustream.tv/crunch"
