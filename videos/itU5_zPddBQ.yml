title: 'Tatsuya Ono | Background Processing with RabbitMQ'
recordingDate: 1496407973
description: "Filmed in Barcelona at ElixirConf EU 2017\n\nAt SQUARE ENIX, we recently opensourced a background processing library called TaskBunny. In this talk, we will go through:\n - the design decision we made to use RabbitMQ instead of using Erlang process/OTP\n - the features the libraries offer\n - some implementations we like to share. For example, how TaskBunny uses the OTP supervisor to handle connection loss\nAdditionally we want to share our story on how we came to opensource our library. We were hesitant to opensource at first, because we thought that using RabbitMQ for background processing wouldn't look attractive to Elixir/Erlang developers. But we did it anyway and we are very happy about it. We hope our story will encourage other developers and teams to share their works as well.\n\nElixirConf EU is a community conference created to promote education, networking and collaboration within the Elixir/Erlang/Ruby communities."
