description: "We all know that climate change is one of the biggest issues we need to tackle.  Fortunately, tech industry has a lot to offer to solve some of these challenges. \n\nIn this episode of CodeStories, we will learn about green software engineering and climate-first approach.  We'll also discuss the recent \"Hack the Climate\" event; specifically the LandPRO team who built an app to help farmer estimate carbon emissions and mitigate climate change. \n \nJump to: \n00:00 episode start \n06:08 LandPRO demo + architecture drawing using Planetary Computer and Azure Maps\n10:24 Making applications carbon efficient\n12:31 Climate first development \n\nLearn more:\nPrinciples of Green Software Engineering https://aka.ms/CS/LearnSSE\nPlanetary Computer https://aka.ms/CS/PlanetaryComputer\nGreen Software Foundation https://aka.ms/CS/GreenSoftwareFoundation\n\nAdditional links from this episode: \nClimate Hackathon (March 2021) - https://hacktheclimate.devpost.com\nOpen source solutions from this hackathon - https://aka.ms/CS/ProjectGallery\nHackathon project winners - Team Eruza, Unit8, Purple Penguin\nClimate First article - https://hajak.se/climate-first-f6a458944c73"
