description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nA Better and More Efficient ML Experience for CERN Users - Ricardo Rocha & Dejan Golubovic, CERN\n\nExperiments at CERN such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) generate petabytes of new data every year, to be stored and analyzed by thousands of physicists around the world. In just a couple years, an upgrade to the LHC will trigger a 10x increase in the amount of data posing a challenge to the existing infrastructure. This session covers how machine learning has been gaining momentum in the high energy physics (HEP) community and particularly at CERN, as a viable option to handle the data growth with a similar amount of resources. The focus is on one particular service based on Kubeflow, and how we extend the existing functionality to offer our users a familiar and seamless integration with site services. How centralizing resources has improved our overall resource usage, how we extended existing functionality to manage end user tokens and credentials allowing access to on-premises storage, and how we explore tools like Harbor, Trivy, OPA and Falco to ensure a reproducible and secure flow from interactive analysis, to model training and finally serving."
