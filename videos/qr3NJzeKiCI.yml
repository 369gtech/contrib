title: 'Docs-as code: arc42, AsciiDoc, Gradle & Co. combined'
recordingDate: 1543661697
description: 'The combination of AsciiDoc and Gradle should be well known by now. But what if you want to go beyond? Have you ever tried to include UML diagrams the easy way, convert Excel to AsciiDoc or export your results to Confluence? This talk shows you what you can really do if you treat your docs as code and apply some tricks you only did to your code before. Forget about copy &amp; paste your images to your documentation - let the build do it! Create different docs for different stakeholders and even run automated tests on your docs!--- Notes to GR8Conf-Team: Slides of an English version of the talk (which will be updated and tailored to the greachconf) can be found at speakerdeck: https://speakerdeck.com/rdmueller/thhg-to-painless-docs I already had a chance to talk about this topic at German conferences and received very good feedback regarding content, know how and style of the presentation.'
