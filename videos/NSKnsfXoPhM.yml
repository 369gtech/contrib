title: 'YOW! Data 2018 - Boris Savkovic - Machine learning applications for the autonomous/connected vehicle'
language: English
recordingDate: 1531872001
description: "The application of streaming and real-time data science/analytics to connected and autonomous vehicles is gaining traction around the world. Intelematics is an Australian leader and innovator in the field of telematics/connected vehicles as well as in big data traffic analytics, with Intelematics services used by Australian and overseas giants such as Ford, Toyota, Google etc.\n\nThe topic of the talk is the application of streaming and big data analytics to autonomous and connected vehicles. Applications covered will include : ability to predict vehicle failures, forecast traffic conditions, automate vehicle insurance claims with automated crash/incident detection, deliver data into the vehicle (traffic signal states and forecasts) etc.\n\nThe talk will give an outline of general trends as well as give some examples of concrete solutions that we have developed at Intelematics in this emerging field, both in Australia and overseas (US and EU) . The focus will be on the application of data science and algortihms, and the key role that these have to play in the emerging field of connected and autonomous vehicles. These relevant data streams bring a number of technical and non-technical challenges that will be discussed : complexity of dealing with geo-spatial and temporal data, safety and security, privacy, streaming nature of data, event-driven nature data, volume of data, complexity of relationships/patterns to be modelled etc.\n\nThe underlying algorithms and techonlogies will be also be discussed in some detail.\n\nBoris is currently the data science lead at Intelematics (Intelematics is the leading provider of real-time traffic and automotive data analytics services in Australia and US/UK, supplying Toyota, Ford, Audi, Google etc), and is responsible for the data science and analytics function at Intelematics . Prior to joining Intelematics, Boris was the lead data scientist at BuildingIQ (venture-backed by Siemens and Schneider Electric) where he led the development of machine learning algorithms for the optimization of energy usage in large-scale buildings (skyscrapers, hospitals etc). Prior to that he worked as a biostatistician in the pharmaceutical industry with Calimmune (spinoff from The California Institute of Technology), where he was responsible for statistical modelling and analysis relating to gene therapy treatments of HIV/AIDS and immune disorder diseases. He has also acted as a private statistical consultant to the private and government/research sectors.\n\nLinkedIn : https://au.linkedin.com/in/borislav-savkovic-23969154\n\n\n\nFor more on YOW!
