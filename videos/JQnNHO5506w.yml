Rather than processing data only at the end of the day, why not react to it continuously as the data arrives? This is the emerging world of stream processing. But stream processing only becomes possible when the fundamental data capture is done in a streaming fashion; after all, you canâ€™t process a daily batch of CSV dumps as a stream. This shift towards stream processing has driven the popularity of Apache Kafka. Making all the organization's data is available centrally as free-flowing streams enables a company's business logic to be represented as stream processing operations. Essentially, applications are stream processors in this new world of stream processing.\nIn her keynote, she will explain how the fundamental nature of application development will change as stream processing goes mainstream."
