description: "RubyConf 2018 - Designing an engineering team: Making room for everyone by Jack Danger\n\nHow many different roles are there on engineering teams? Officially, there's probably just a manager and maybe a tech lead. Unofficially, you have technical specialists, company veterans, people focused on tools, and those who think deeply about the product.\n\nIn this talk we'll steal the best ideas from operating rooms, wartime deployments, and courtroom litigation. We'll see how it's possible to train, reward, and empower your teammates by respecting their uniqueness while also making room for very junior developers to join fast-moving teams."
