description: 'One aspect of Java development that is considered too low-level or too hard-core for the average developer to know about is Java agents. But nowadays every self-respecting tool or framework imposes one upon you— it has become an integral part of an average Java developer’s life. The main use case for using a Java agent is to manipulate application bytecode on the fly. This hands-on, code-heavy session covers tips, tricks, and best practices for creating a Java agent as well as how to enhance your application with ByteBuddy, a friendly bytecode manipulation library. Even if you don’t have prior Java agent experience, you will leave this session with enough knowledge to create and use Java agents and be dangerous.'
