description: "Clare Mclennan, Menno Finlay-Smits\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/100/\n\nThe Cacophony Project is a small, open-source, non-profit with a gigantic vision.  We aim to save New Zealand's native birds which are under threat from introduced predators such as possums, stoats, and rats. \r\n\r\nIn the last couple of years we have been busy developing digital solutions to monitor native bird populations and eliminate their introduced predators.\r\n\r\nThese solutions promise to be several magnitudes more effective than traditional approaches that are in use today. \r\n\r\nDuring our talk you will get to see and touch our thermal cameras and the machine learning model that we use to automatically identify animals.   We will also talk about our latest developments such as using audio based lures and our software controlled trap replacements. \r\n\r\nAs part our session we will also be discussing how we make open source for work us, as our project is not your average open source project.   This is due to our compelling but expansive vision, the start up phase we are in, and that our work spans software, hardware and science.\r\n\r\nCome and see what a handful of people have been able to achieve with the help of our dedicated open source community!\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
