description: '#Codemotion Rome 2018 - Serverless is the new black - I can deploy my application to the cloud without ever worrying about infrastructure. We all remember the days when we had to spend hours and hours configuring and debugging web servers when all we wanted was to just code and test our app. Those days are long gone and itâ€™s time for us to unlearn how to provision and manage infrastructure while focusing on building and scaling applications.'
