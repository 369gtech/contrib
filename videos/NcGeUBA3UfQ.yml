recordingDate: 1479338186
description: "Automate ALL the Things\n\nAvan Mathur, Product Manager, ElectricFlow, Electric Cloud\n\nA myriad of point-tools, frameworks and infrastructures are involved in your software delivery process – from development, through build, testing, deployment, all the way to a Production Release. \n\nWhile many of these tools are free/open source, the operational and technology overhead of orchestrating the hand-offs from one tool to the next in the process – are not without cost.\n\nTo improve developer productivity and resource utilization – and to enable enterprise-scale, cross-project visibility and shorter time to market – organizations are working to automate and orchestrate the entire tool chain across the end-to-end delivery pipeline.\n\n“Automate All the Things” is a key tenant to any DevOps or Continuous Delivery initiative. \n\nThis workshop will use a real case study and a live demo to show how you can use a free DevOps Release Automation tool – ElectricFlow – to orchestrate your entire software delivery pipeline. In this demo, we will create a fully-automated release pipeline deploying a Cloud Java application, tying-in common tools that you likely use in your process from CI build to Release: including Git, Jenkins, Selenium, Chef, Docker, and more.\n\nLearn how to:\n• Seamlessly orchestrate third-party tools to automate your entire process- from start to finish\n• Get visibility into your end-to-end application release pipeline\n• Deploy any application to any environment using any tool-set – for free\n\nDOES16 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
