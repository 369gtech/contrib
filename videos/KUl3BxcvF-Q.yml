description: "Filmed at https://2018.dotswift.io on January 29th in Paris. More talks on https://dotconferences.com/talks\n\nAccessibility is a complex problem. In this talk Sally looks underneath this ‘umbrella’ term, talks about making something usable by everyone and how complex vision is.\n\nShe references a personal story of visual impairment, demonstrates how to recreate that impairment using GPUImage2 on the iPhone, then how to reverse it and discusses how powerful that can be in both testing your apps and in compensating for real impairments."
