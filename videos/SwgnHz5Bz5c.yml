title: 'Use Open Source, Bare Metal, & 5G to Achieve Autonomous Drone Delivery!'
language: English
recordingDate: 1583870851
description: 'We will be discussing a use case for utilizing drones to make deliveries to warehouses, as well as looking at the technologies used to build an end to end IoT pipeline on Kubernetes that allows you to gather and visualize your fleet in real-time. We will be demonstrating how this data can be utilized to send real-time instructions to drones in cases such as collision avoidance, no-fly zone avoidance, and heavy wind avoidance. All of the code from this talk is 100% open source and can be tested by anyone in attendance.'
