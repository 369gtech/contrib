description: "Stranger Danger: Addressing Vulnerable CF Application Dependencies [B] - Guy Podjarny, CEO, Snyk    \n\nOpen source packages are an incredible productivity boost, but also represent an undeniable risk. Such packages often include severe vulnerabilities, easily discovered and exploited by attackers. Keeping up-to-date on Cloud Foundry protects you from kernel and operating system vulnerabilities, but what about your application’s dependencies, pulled from npm, Maven, RubyGems and more? \n\nThis talk will help you understand the risk and how to protect your application from vulnerable packages. We’ll demonstrate real world exploits on a live CF application, demonstrating their impact. We’ll then explain the steps you should put in place to address these vulnerabilities, and how to best implement them in your dev process and CF environment.\n\nGuy Podjarny\nSnyk\nCEO\nLondon, UK\nTwitter Tweet  Websitehttps://snyk.io/\nGuy Podjarny (@guypod) is a cofounder at Snyk.io, focusing on securing open source code.
