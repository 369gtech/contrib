description: "PyData NYC 2018\n\nIn this talk I will discuss exponential family embeddings, which are methods that extend the idea behind word embeddings to other data types. I will describe how we used dynamic embeddings to understand how data science skill-sets have transformed over the last 3 years using our large corpus of jobs. The key takeaway is that these models can enrich analysis of specialized datasets.\n\nSlides - https://www.slideshare.net/PyData/using-embeddings-to-understand-the-variance-and-evolution-of-data-science-maryam-jahanshahi\n===\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
