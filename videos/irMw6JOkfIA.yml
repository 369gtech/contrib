description: "I found a way to ‚Äòcheat‚Äô the CAP theorem, and in this session, I‚Äôll show you how to do it. No, seriously üôÇ\n\nThe CAP theorem is a very difficult problem to solve in distributed systems, but it turns out that there are a few simple rules that you can follow to get strong eventual consistency in the cloud. These rules can work in almost any programming language, and I‚Äôll talk about what it take to make it all happen. At Domain, we used these principles to recover from catastrophic data failures in our clickstream events, and in this session, I‚Äôll show you how we did it.\n\nWith CRDTs + Event Sourcing and its intrinsic immutability, there‚Äôs a mathematically provable way to ensure that all nodes in a distributed system (such as a data store, or an Akka.NET grid) get the same level of consistency without even talking to each other.\n\nPhilip Laureano is a Technical Team Lead for CommercialRealEstate.com.au and has been working in software development since 1999. When he is not working on making his team awesome, you can usually find him creating his own compilers and working with distributed frameworks like Akka.NET for fun. Philip is the author of the LinFu and Hiro IOC container frameworks, which make extensive use of IL ‚Äúvoodoo‚Äù to make cool and productive things happen for the Common Language Runtime.\n\nHe has also been a three-time speaker for NDC Oslo 2011, 2012, and 2015.\n\nFor more on YOW!
