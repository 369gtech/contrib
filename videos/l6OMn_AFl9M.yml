See http://fitc.ca for details.\n\nOverview\nA style guide is a great collaboration tool to bridge communication gaps between business stakeholders, designers, and developers. Static or living style guides are a great place to start but become increasingly difficult to maintain because style guide generators are dependent on parsing comments in CSS in order to generate HTML patterns and documentation. In short, there is no single source of truth for the HTML leading to maintainability problems. In this session we will discover creating a truly reusable module through the creation of a pattern API.\n\nTechnologies discussed include Node, Angular, React, Component, and Sass (Libsass).\n\nBermon Painter\nUser Experience Designer\nhttp://bermonpainter.com\nhttps://twitter.com/bermonpainter\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
