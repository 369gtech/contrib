These image formats are far superior to their predecessors, but unfortunately are only supported by very specific browsers, and aren't always easy to generate. Akamai has recently added support for these image formats, and learned a lot in the process. In this short talk, Ido will explain more about these formats and share some of our experience working with them.\n\nIdo Safruti\nAkamai\nIdo Safruti heads a product group in Akamai focusing on web performance and scalability.
