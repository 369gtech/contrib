description: "In the Perl ecosystem, C is a highly respected but second-class language. C::Blocks changes this situation by embedding a C compiler directly into the Perl parser. Blocks of C code are placed directly among lines of Perl. The compiler is Just-In-Time, making your C code just as scriptable as your Perl code. Functions, variables, and other C declarations are scoped in a Perlish way. In this talk, I give a brief introduction to this module.\n\nI am an Assistant Professor of Physics at Eckerd College in St. Petersburg, Florida. I have used Perl for scientific computing for a decade, prodding PDL and Prima in the process, and writing a number of scientifically-oriented distributions available on CPAN. I earned my Ph.D. in Physics from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign."
