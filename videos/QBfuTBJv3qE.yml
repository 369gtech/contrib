description: "Speakers: Casey Doolittle and Phil Dutson, ICON Health & Fitness\n\nPivotal Disclaimer: These are not Pivotal employees, nor is this a \"best practices\" session or represent Pivotal recommendations. This is an great story of how 2 guys used the tools they already knew to respond to a insane deadline!\n\nCreating a transactional website that is secure, fast, and responsive is a challenge all on its own. Creating one in 24 hours borders madness, however with the resources that Spring brings to the table, this can be accomplished. Casey Doolittle and Phil Dutson were issued the task of creating a charity-benefit website two days before the sale started. By leveraging the flexibility and power that various Spring components bring to the table, this mighty feat was accomplished. During this talk Casey and Phil will discuss the how and why of using Spring 3.2.4, Spring Web MVC, and Spring Security 3.1.4 as their framework of choice to get the project done on time.\n\nLearn more about Spring Framework and Spring MVC at http://projects.spring.io/spring-framework\n\nLearn more about Spring Security at http://projects.spring.io/spring-security"
