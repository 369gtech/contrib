language: English
recordingDate: 1533210565
description: "The presentation discusses the use of the Smart-DB concept, a database-centered architecture: Good and Bad. From the monitoring-data of several systems (using Statspack, AWR, OEM and Lab128) we show symptoms, explain diagnoses and suggest fixes. The goal is to explain where SmartDB works (mostly) and (sometimes) doesnt work.\n\nBackground: From various systems I've helped build and/or troubleshoot, I think I can deduce some advantages and pitfalls to mix in the discussion about SmartDB and IT architecture in general.\n\nAfter this presentation, attendees will better understand benefits of the SmartDB concept. They will be able to make better-informed decisions about using SmartDB. And they will know how to avoid some of the pitfalls."
