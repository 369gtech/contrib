recordingDate: 1615559852
description: "In this part of The React Native Show podcast dedicated to the multiplatform aspect of React Native, our host, Mike Grabowski, and his guests:\n\nMonica Restrepo – Software Engineer at Major League Soccer\nKudo Chien – Software Engineer at CloudMosa\nEloy Duran – Principal Software Engineer at Microsoft\nRam N – an Engineering Manager at Oculus\n\nare talking about the future of React Native and its general direction.\n\nYou’ll hear about:\n\n- What opportunities do our guests envision when it comes to sharing code between mobile & web (traditional React and React Native targets) and desktop environments?\n- What I really like about React Native is the separation of concerns and that there’s a clear concept of a renderer that one can use to take React to a whole new platform. Do you think it could – potentially – be an interesting achievement for the Flutter community that would make React Native a viable choice for them?\n- How does Microsoft plan to implement the features from the re-architecture, such as CodeGen, when they land? Is this something you’re already thinking about?\n\nThis video is a part of The React Native Show Podcast Ep 2: \"React Native EU 2020 Conference Q&A Panel\" \nWatch the full episode here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHSe66Dhs7M"
