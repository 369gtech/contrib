description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nEverything Wrong with K8s Authentication and How We Worked Around It - Mo Khan & Margo Crawford, VMware\n\nKubernetes provides many flexible authentication options, but they are inaccessible to a large portion of Kubernetes users in practice. When enterprise cluster administrators have clusters across many providers or distributions of Kubernetes, they struggle to unify them under a single identity platform. Kubernetes authentication options are often not available on managed cloud provider platforms, and even on self-hosted clusters it is non-trivial to integrate with common identity technologies such as OIDC or LDAP. This session will describe common pitfalls and limitations of Kubernetes authentication and show how to work around them. We will describe how to integrate identities from OIDC/LDAP into any Kubernetes cluster, provide nice login flows for cluster users, and enable federated logins across multiple clusters. Attend this session to learn about the latest Kubernetes auth integration techniques and see what’s coming in future Kubernetes versions."
