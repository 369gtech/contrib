description: "Throughout the talk I discuss the mental models we construct in tech, the cognitive dissonance we experience when confronted with new ideas, specifically about CSS.\n\nWe know CSS has a separate mental model because we keep hearing the same debate rage on: “Is CSS broken or awesome?” This talk is about enabling teams to communicate and accommodate these different mental models. I share examples of effective tools, and how they change the way designers and developers interact.\n\nSlides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RIA7vma_ErlDAY7dg-AbQv1f3xNEyTddr52LcWKNsLM\nAbout Natalya: http://artist-developer.com/\nFollow Natalya: https://twitter.com/natalyathree\n\nMore about CSS Day: https://cssday.nl or https://twitter.com/cssdayconf\nReceive conference announcements in your inbox: https://cssday.nl/subscribe"
