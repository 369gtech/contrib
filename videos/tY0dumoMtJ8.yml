description: "Gail Ollis, Thomas Beards\n\nMonday 17th, 12:00 (Assembly Room)\nA talk (25 minutes)\nThomas is a cyber security management student with autism. Gail is a university lecturer in programming and cyberpsychology. They have had some interesting conversations and Thomas isn’t the only one who has learned a lot this year.\n\nIn this talk, Thomas will share his insights into common higher education practices which can make it harder for people like him to learn, and why cyber security education in particular could benefit from recognising and addressing this. Gail will reflect on where she’s got to in her own contribution to that process and invite suggestions for doing better.\n\nThe speaker suggested this session is suitable for teachers."
