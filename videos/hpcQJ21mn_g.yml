description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nNotary: State of the Container Supply Chain - Justin Cormack, Docker & Steve Lasker, Microsoft\n\nAs supply chain security becomes a larger concern for all types of organization, the tooling for supply chain security becomes critical. The Notary v2 project was set up to address issues with the original v1 project that did not see widespread use, and to gather consensus on the types of security mechanisms that were needed. This talk will show the progress we have made, and go through the decisions we made so far, as we are going into early production use. We will look at the future roadmap and the supply chain landscape."
