description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Copenhagen 2021. #GOTOcon #GOTOcph\nhttp://gotocph.com\n\nDave Farley - Continuous Delivery & DevOps Pioneer, Award-winning Author, Founder & Director of Continuous Delivery Ltd.\n\nFind plenty more from Dave on his Continuous Delivery YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCfqyGl3nq_V0bo64CjZh8g\n\nABSTRACT\nDeployment Pipelines are central to a Continuous Delivery approach. They represent an organising principle for the automation of large parts of our development and deliver process. We optimise for fast, clear feedback to help sustain a development team’s ability to make progress with high confidence. Like many ideas that become well know though, they are often misinterpreted.\nA Deployment Pipeline is much more than your build script, its more specific than that, It is much more than an automated deployment tool. A Deployment Pipeline is the definitive statement on the releasability of your software.\nDave Farley invented the idea of ‘Deployment Pipelines’ so come along and hear what he has to say on what should, and what should not be in your Deployment Pipeline if you want to create better software faster [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n00:33 Continuous Delivery\n03:42 The nature of the problem\n07:45 Best way to reduce gaps\n09:14 What determines releasability?\n12:32 Confident to make progress\n14:13 Optimize for learning\n15:52 Managing complexity\n19:02 Deployment pipeline\n21:05 Commit stage\n24:38 Acceptance stage\n26:25 Optimize for speed\n31:38 Better software faster\n32:53 Outro\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotocph.com/2021/sessions/1950/continuous-delivery-pipelines-how-to-build-better-sw-faster\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nDavid Farley • Continuous Delivery Pipelines • https://leanpub.com/cd-pipelines\nDave Farley & Jez Humble • Continuous Delivery • https://amzn.to/3ocIHwd\nDavid Farley • Modern Software Engineering • https://amzn.to/3GI468M\n\nCD TRAINING COURSES\nIf you want to learn Continuous Delivery and DevOps skills, check out Dave Farley's courses\nhttps://bit.ly/DFTraining \n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#GOTOxDaveFarley #CD #ContinuousDelivery #FeatureBranch #DaveFarley #BDD #DevOps #Testing #StateOfDevOps #StateOfDevOpsReport #Releasability #Programming #SoftwareEngineering #CDPipelines #DeploymentPipelines \n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
