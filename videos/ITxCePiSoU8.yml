title: '"Essential Git Fu for tech writers" - Gaurav Nelson (LCA 2020)'
recordingDate: 1579235321
description: "Gaurav Nelson\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/170/\n\nDealing with Git often becomes problematic for us writers. Although some writers excel at handling Git commands and its nuances, many writers struggle to deal with them. In this presentation, I am sharing some techniques I have seen people (developers and writers) use.  These tricks are easy to use, and writers can quickly adapt them to their writing workflow. This presentation isn't about learning git basics or understanding git commands, but rather, using aliases and bash functions to handle typical Git workflow commands we use daily.\r\n\r\nUsing aliases and bash functions, allow you to map easy English terms for the Git commands you use every day. For example, to create a new branch, you can run the command `git newbranch ‹branch-name›` instead of `git checkout -b ‹branch-name›`. Which is more logical and saves you from remembering the actual command. This example is a simple operation, you can also use these techniques handle complex tasks, such as downloading someone else's pull request (or merge request) for review.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
