description: ".NET is back with a renewed energy and is undeniably amidst a remarkable transformation. As .NET continues to evolve, so too does Pivotal Application Service for Windows to bolster that evolution. In this session, we will cover what capabilities have emerged to deliver a first-class experience for .NET's unique needs on Pivotal Cloud Foundry and why they make PCF a premier enterprise platform for cloud-native, modernized, and legacy .NET workloads. We will review the backstory of the product, the basics of deploying the new Windows 2016 stack on PCF, what happens to your .NET application when it is pushed, how to inspect it, and finally, what Windows Server Containers mean for .NET developers, enterprises, and the future of Pivotal Cloud Foundry's .NET capabilities. Join this session to see how PCF operators and developers insights and experiences have been guiding the features of the platform.\n\nSpeaker:\nWilliam Martin\nStaff Product Manager, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
