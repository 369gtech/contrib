language: English
recordingDate: 1540408354
description: "Andrejus Baranovskis, Chief Executive Officer & Technical Expert, Red Samurai Consulting\n\nLearn how to build a client-side chatbot with Oracle JavaScript Extension Toolkit (Oracle JET) on top of a contextual chatbot model implemented with the TensorFlow Learn library, using a deep neural network model. Context is king when youâ€™re talking about intelligent chatbots. It is very important to keep context in mind; otherwise conversation becomes useless. This session focuses on three areas: user intent processing with TensorFlow machine learning, conversation context tracking, and chatbot UI implementation with Oracle JET. Communication between the Oracle JET client side and TensorFlow is implemented through REST with the Flask microframework for Python."
