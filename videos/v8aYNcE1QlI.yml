description: "Security companies estimate that 50% of security issues are the result of problems in the system design. Such weaknesses cannot be found by automated tools.\nThreat modeling is the process of analysing your system and try to identify weaknesses in design and missing security controls. This talk will introduce you to threat modeling and explain some of the techniques you can use to identify those threaty threats in your systems.\n\nSpeaker: Erlend Oftedal"
