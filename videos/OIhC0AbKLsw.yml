title: 'Docker and ServiceFabric - A taste of two platforms - Michele Bustamante'
recordingDate: 1474623960
description: "Docker is somewhat of a poster child for the microservices wave but ServiceFabric is a very interesting PaaS alternative at the other extreme.\nWhile there are many options in the middle, including various container services platforms, this session focuses on comparing the two from a developer and DevOps perspective noting design, development, topology and deployment lifecycle differences."
