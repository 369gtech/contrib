What if every detail of the world would be shown in the style of a painting from Van Gogh?\n\nOne of the many interesting developments in the field of Deep Learning is the so called \"Style Transfer\". It describes a possibility to create a patchwork (or pastiche) from two images. While one of these images defines the the artistic style of the result picture, the other one is used for extracting the image content. The Hardware Hacking Team from TNG Technology Consulting managed to build an application using OpenCV and Tensorflow to realize such goggles. When you see the world through these glasses, your environment will be displayed in the styles of famous painters like Claude Monet or Pablo Picasso.\n\nWithin this talk you will be introduced into the scientific field of Realtime Style Transfer. It will also cover and explain in detail the Deep Learning techniques used for this application."
