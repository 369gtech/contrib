description: 'Abstract: The era of the astro-jock is over, no more men in tin cans taking orders from mission control. Staying alive off Earth will require the ability to thrive in an environment that requires constant adaptation. Fellow hacker and analogue astronaut J.J. Hastings argues that hackers are an ideal match to the space environment. Her talk suggests how we might become extra-terrestrial hackers and shares insights from her missions as a field researcher and analogue astronaut.'
