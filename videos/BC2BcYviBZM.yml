description: "with Mark Heckler \n\nWith Reactive programming developers can build message-driven, elastic, resilient, responsive services - yet many don't know where to begin. The Reactive Streams initiative gives a baseline and Project Reactor is a great way to get immediately productive.\n\nMoving to a reactive, non-blocking model is not without its challenges. Relatively speaking, a blocking model is much simpler to code, debug, and troubleshoot. How do we handle exceptions in a never-ending flow of values? How can we provide options for publishers that still keep subscribers happy...and functional? How can we debug & fix things if the wheels come off?\n\nWe will explore the net-new Netty-based web runtime and show you how to:\n\nintegrate easily with existing Spring-stack technologies\neasily transition from blocking to reactive applications & systems\nbuild reactive data pipelines from your microservices all the way to the metal\ndefine your API in an imperative style and functionally, reaping all benefits both ways\nleverage powerful new testing mechanisms to make code better and life easier\nThe presenter will code all examples live and in real time. Come to gain real, practical knowledge!"
