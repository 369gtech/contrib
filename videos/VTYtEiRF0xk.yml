recordingDate: 1581886523
description: "Over the past few years, reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved promising results and it is currently being explored in a wide range of fields. In areas such as self driving cars, gaming and medicine, RL is the frontier of state-of-the-art results. In this workshop we will explore what the fuss is all about!\n\nIf reinforcement learning has been a mysterious domain to you, this session will most likely leave you with a greater understanding of the process and aid you in how to set up projects of your own.\n\nThis presentation serves as an introduction to reinforcement learning where we implement a Pac-Man agent. The Pac-Man agent will learn how to solve different maps using Q-learning and Deep Q-learning.\n\nManu Gopinathan\nMalte Loller-Andersen\nKnowit\n\nRecorded at Jfokus 2020 in Stockholm 4th of february\nhttp://www.jfokus.se"
