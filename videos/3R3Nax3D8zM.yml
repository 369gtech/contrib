description: "Gamedev-grade Debugging\nhttp://www.codemesh.io/codemesh2014/leszek-godlewski\n\nVideo games are complex and non-deterministic systems. So complex, in fact, that some days the everyday breakpoint just doesn't cut it when you're looking for that next bug. Drawing from the experience of deploying three large titles to four platforms, this talk will discuss the different approaches and borderline magical tricks to debugging different parts of a game: noise filtering when our breakpoint is hit way too often, memory stomping, time-dependent bugs, rendering glitches… Story of a game programmer's life."
