description: "Filmed at http://2016.dotjs.io on December 5th in Paris. More talks on http://thedotpost.com\n\nBeing open-minded is an attitude worth cultivating: we get exposed to more ideas that form our opinions and allow us to make better decisions. This improves the quality of our products or even our lives. To prove this point, Igor focuses on the background story of building Angular and show how it was influenced by the whole JavaScript ecosystem."
