description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2014.\nSpeakers: Jon Brisbin, Stephane Maldini\nSlides:http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/spring-one2gx-2014reactivestreams-41130280\nCore Spring Track\nThis session will introduce attendees to the Reactive Streams project, a new initiative between reactive software's heavy-hitters like Pivotal, Typesafe, Netflix, Twitter, and others. Since Pivotal's own Reactor framework implements this informal standard, we'll demonstrate how to build applications that can connect to other Reactive Streams implementations in a completely non-blocking way."
