title: 'Math for Game Developers - Rotating Characters (Matrix Rotation)'
recordingDate: 1367510412
description: "NOTE: I make an error while drawing the diagrams around the 4:00 mark, I accidentally switch to left-handed coordinates. To get counter-clockwise spinning, you need to flip the signs on the sin(theta) entries of the matrix. Lesson learned: Pay attention to whether you're in left or right handed coordinates when doing this sort of thing.\n\nRotating our basis vectors makes a rotation matrix that we can use to rotate the enemies when they're shot.\n\nFind the source code here: https://github.com/BSVino/MathForGameDevelopers/tree/matrix-rotate\n\nQuestion?
