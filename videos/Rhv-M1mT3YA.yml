title: 'YOW! Lambda Jam 2021 - John Hughes - Testing smart contracts with QuickCheck'
language: English
recordingDate: 1628208807
description: "I will talk about some recent work on a random testing framework for smart contracts on the Cardano blockchain--which supports the world's largest \"proof of stake\" cryptocurrency. In contrast to the Ethereum blockchain, Cardano contracts are written in Haskell, but of course, they still need to be tested. I'll talk about the testing framework we've built, and its most novel aspect: not only must we test that nothing bad ever happens, but also that something good is always possible.\n\nJohn Hughes is co-founder and CEO of Quviq AB, and the creator of QuickCheck. He was also involved in the design of Haskell being co-chair of the committee defining the language. He currently divides his time between his academic involvement as Chair of Chalmers University, Gothenburg, and QuviQ, the company promoting QuickCheck.\nJohn Hughes has been a functional programming enthusiast for more than thirty years, at the Universities of Oxford, Glasgow, and since 1992 Chalmers University in Gothenburg, Sweden. He served on the Haskell design committee, co-chairing the committee for Haskell 98, and is the author of more than 75 papers, including \"Why Functional Programming Matters\", one of the classics of the area. With Koen Claessen, he created QuickCheck, the most popular testing tool among Haskell programmers, and in 2006 he founded Quviq to commercialise the technology using Erlang.\n\nFor more information on YOW!
