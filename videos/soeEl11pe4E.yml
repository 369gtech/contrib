description: "Machine learning has been leveraged to radically change many industry verticals. The problem is the learning curve has always been very steep. Exotic languages, complex tools, little or no documentation. But innovative cloud based ML platforms are changing that and democratizing access. During this session you will learn the basics of machine learning, and you will see a demo of how you can build a prediction model using real-world data, evaluate several different algorithms and modeling strategies, then deploy the finished model as a scalable RESTful API within minutes.\n\nDevConf 2017 (http://devconf.pl)\n13-15 September 2017"
