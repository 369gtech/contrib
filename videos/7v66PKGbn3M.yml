Hear examples from companies like Hotel Tonight and Deezer that are using Google's platforms to increase user login and registration velocity, drive more Android downloads, and engage users across multiple platforms and devices. Attendees will learn about Google+ Sign-In and how to integrate with it via code samples on how to fetch and handle OAuth tokens (includes incremental authorization), which OAuth scopes you can request user's data with, what you can do once you have the token (includes People APIs, Moments APIs). See what your users experience when they go through Google Sign-In (including over-the-air Android installs and cross-device-sign-on).\n\nWatch all Google I/O 2014 videos at: g.co/io14videos"
