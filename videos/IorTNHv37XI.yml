description: "Code Mesh London is the best place in Europe for non-mainstream tech and programming languages. On 4-5 December 2013 over 50 inventors and originators of the most innovative languages and technologies of the moment shared their experience with 200 attendees. Topics included Scala, Haskell, Clojure, Erlang, Elixir, Julia and much more. See you at Code Mesh 2014! codemesh.io/\n\nAbout the talk:\nWhat's the best mental model for software construction? The prevailing model draws heavily from physical construction. Terms like architecture, foundation, plumbing -- even \"design\" -- come from our history of building real structures like houses, roads, and bridges. While they often dominate our thinking about software, should they? Are there other models that are more helpful?\n\nIn this talk Garrett will argue that biology is a more useful model for software construction. Understanding how organisms function and evolve opens up thinking that's informed by the universe's most complex and successful systems. Innovations like DNA, complex cells, photosynthesis, sex and even death contain remarkably useful patterns that we can apply in our day-to-day work as programmers."
