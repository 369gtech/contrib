title: 'YOW! Lambda Jam 2015 Andrew Browne - Lets see what we can do! with F# Computation Expressions'
recordingDate: 1514642305
description: "All F# developers will be familiar with:\n\n* seq expressions that allow imperative looking code to compute lazy sequences of data on demand.\n* async blocks that enable asynchronous operations to be composed together.\n\nRather than build constructs like seq and async into the language F# has built them on top of a more general feature: computation expressions. This decision enables developers to build their own expression languages for composable abstractions using familiar syntax. This talk will explore the power of computation expressions to deal with a range of real-world problem domains. Examples will include:\n\n* Composing computations that fail\n* Asynchronous paged data sources\n* Building typesafe domain specific languages that be can interpreted at runtime\n\nBy writing programs this way we can separate the pure problem domain from the underlying details of the computations.\n\nAndrew has a particular interest in both strongly typed functional programming and event sourcing for producing systems that are both correct and easy to reason about. With a long history as a .net developer he has had great success introducing C# developers to functional programming through F#. Recently heâ€™s been spending more time working with Haskell.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
