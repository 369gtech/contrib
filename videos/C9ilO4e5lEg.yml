title: 'DrupalCon Nashville 2018: What''s possible with WordPress 5.0'
recordingDate: 1523587424
description: "SLIDES: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11PEgmoaKUFMWw7d4OwTBsYlVVeUaq2TgyBKqgYu9srY/edit?usp=sharing\n\n\n\nDrupal has a sibling CMS. WordPress runs on the LAMP with a mix of code written yesterday and code written in the early 2000s. WordPress is currently undergoing a major modernization of the code that controls the editorial experience. The WordPress community's angst and excitement over the upcoming WordPress 5.0 release and its React-based Gutenberg editor feel a lot like the build up to Drupal 8.\n\nDrupal and WordPress are similar enough that they face the same technical and cultural questions. Yet WordPress is also different enough so as to challenge our assumptions about how we answer them:\n\n\nWill a large and diverse community of PHP-centric developers embrace React?\nCan contrib code keep up with drastic changes to an admin UI?\nWould the ability to schedule deployments of config changes help site owners?\nWhat are the repercussions of supporting older versions of PHP?\nHow much modernization can a toolchain take while still claiming backwards compatibility?"
