title: 'Fertile Ground, the Roots of Clojure - Michael Fogus'
recordingDate: 1355703262
description: 'Whereby I explore some of the programming language and paradigm influences on the Clojure programming language. Clojure contains its own novelty, but its greatest strengths are built on the foundation of existing language features. I will go through a handful of features in my 30 minutes and explain how they were influenced by existing features in other programming languages. Likewise, I will explain how Clojure diverges from its progenitors.'
