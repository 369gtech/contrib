title: 'David Nolen - Rethinking Identity with Clojure'
recordingDate: 1557963710
description: 'As biometric authentication via consumer smart devices becomes increasingly commonplace, it''s time to rethink identity and trust. In this talk, we''ll see how Clojure and ClojureScript are well suited for this ambitious task by providing solid tools to implement all the necessary parts of the architecture - from UI clients on smart devices to smart contracts running on cloud services. We''ll also uncover how these tools bring incredible agility and better time-to-delivery with one of the oldest ideas in the book - REPL driven development. - Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/channel/5NYvjSCMHMD'
