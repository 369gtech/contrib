description: "We’ve all had the experience of having designed the perfect comp: stylish photos, perfectly sized names, and the right amount of copy only to have everything fall apart in the development process when real content crashes your carefully curated design party. The pain point of managing the content in our designs needs to be addressed if we want to insure we end up with the best user experience in our apps and websites.\n\nThis session will give you a look at the development of a new tool — Adobe Experience Design CC (Preview) — created to solve this problem and will look at what happens to UX and product design when our tools are as dynamic and flexible as the problems we’re trying to solve.\n\nPaul Trani\nSr. Creative Cloud Evangelist, Adobe\nhttp://twitter.com/paultrani\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
