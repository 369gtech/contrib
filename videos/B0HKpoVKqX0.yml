title: 'The Computer Science behind a modern distributed data store by Max Neunho?ffer'

recordingDate: 1510260669
description: "What we see in the modern data store world is a race between different approaches to achieve a distributed and resilient storage of data. Every application needs a stateful layer which holds the data. There are at least three necessary ingredients which are everything else than trivial to combine and of course even more challenging when heading for an acceptable performance.\n\nOver the past years there has been significant progress in respect in both the science and practical implementations of such data stores. In his talk Max Neunhoeffer will introduce the audience to some of the needed ingredients, address the difficulties of their interplay and show four modern approaches of distributed open-source data stores.\n\nTopics are:\n\n* Challenges in developing a distributed, resilient data store\n* Consensus, distributed transactions, distributed query optimization and execution\n* The inner workings of ArangoDB, Cassandra, Cockroach and RethinkDB\n\nThe talk will touch complex and difficult computer science, but will at the same time be accessible to and enjoyable by a wide range of developers.\n\n# Max Neunhöffer\nMax Neunhöffer, Senior Developer and Architect of ArangoDB\n\nMax Neunhöffer is a mathematician turned database developer. In his academic career he has worked for 16 years on the development and implementation of new algorithms in computer algebra. During this time he has juggled a lot with mathematical big data like group orbits containing trillions of points. Recently he has returned from St. Andrews to Germany, has shifted his focus to NoSQL databases, and now helps to develop ArangoDB. He has spoken at international conferences including Strata London or MesosCon Seattle."
