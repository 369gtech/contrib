Our Android app is installed on more than 3 million devices and has more than 500K daily\nactive users so the development and maintenance brings a lot of real challenges to the Android team. In this talk we are gonna tell you how we faced these problems, which solutions we found to solve them, and how we managed to allow team members to focus on the development of new features.\n\nhttps://it.droidcon.com/2020/​​​​​​\nhttps://twitter.com/Droidconit​​​​​​\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/showcase/droidcon-italy\nhttps://www.facebook.com/droidconIt"
