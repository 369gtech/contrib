title: 'DrupalCon Baltimore 2017: Data Driven Design for Better Business'
recordingDate: 1493240278
description: "We do not create design based on a client’s favorite color – and it is rare that we’d ever be persuaded to do so. At Elevated Third, all our design decisions are based on data. We run tests, do research and generate numbers to support almost every design decision our teams make.\n\nIt is difficult, if not impossible, for clients to argue with cold, hard facts. So, we put in the leg work upfront, instead of spending time making rounds of revisions for indecisive clients. We show, in quantifiable terms, what their customers respond to and build design around those results. For this reason, our clients are happier, our relationships are smoother, and our business more efficient.\n\nClient decisions happen faster when we can offer them the best option possible, backed up by numbers. The largest Drupal 8 site we’ve built to date launched on time and under budget based on this theory. Our UX Designers and Content Strategists can set up quick tests to prove why one icon or label should be selected over another, so that our clients are not burdened based on preference, but instead, numbers. This tactic has made Elevated Third more profitable and efficient to help our small agency grow."
