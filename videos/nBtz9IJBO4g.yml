description: "This video was recorded at Code Elixir LDN 18: http://bit.ly/2vxJuxL\n\nGet involved in Code Sync's next Elixir conference: http://bit.ly/2Mcm4aS\n\n---\n\nPATTERN MATCHING: THE GATEWAY TO LOVING ELIXIR\nby Kate Travers\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nPattern\nMatching\nLove\n\nTALK LEVEL: Beginner\n\nABSTRACT\nWhat is pattern matching in Elixir? For Kate, it's what won her over to the language. This deceptively powerful paradigm is at the heart of what makes Elixir such a compelling language to program in. It's doing so much more than help you write small, declarative, maintainable functions; it's making you a stronger programmer.\n\nThis talk covers pattern matching basics, then moves into practical, real world examples for a thorough introduction to Elixir's implementation of this crush-worthy construct.\n\nRead the full abstract: http://bit.ly/2MvvAm9\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - KATE TRAVERS\nFormer art shipper, current code shipper at Flatiron School (WeWork)\n\nKate Travers is a Brooklyn-based fullstack web developer, specialising in Rails, React, and Elixir applications. A graduate of the Flatiron School, Kate currently spends her days building Learn.co, the online learning platform that powers FIS and 2U programs.\n\nOutside work, Kate is an active volunteer, tutor and mentor through Flatiron School, as well as backup quarterback for the three-time-defending champions of the Brooklyn co-ed touch football league.\n\nMore on Kate Travers: http://bit.ly/2MvvAm9\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE ELIXIR LDN 18\nWebsite: www.codesync.global\nTwitter: www.twitter.com/CodeElixirIO\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/CodeSyncGlobal\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/code-sync/\nMail: info at codesync.global"
