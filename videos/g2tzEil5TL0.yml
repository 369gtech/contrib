After all, a div and a section tag all render the same, right? But in the world of accessibility semantics are extremely important. Today on the show we'll cover how proper semantics let you express the affordances for your UIs, and I'll explain how those affordances get transformed into the accessibility tree. If you've ever wondered HOW a screen reader turns a bunch of HTML into a spoken UI then you'll definitely enjoy today's episode :)"
