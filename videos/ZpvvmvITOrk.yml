description: "http://www.cppcon.org\nâ€”\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2014\n--\nMany organizations have significant investments in a large existing C++ codebase, and Google is no exception. Our code is intended to survive for decades, but continue to track new language standards as they emerge. To do so, we have developed tools and techniques which provide the ability to automatically refactor code to use new APIs as they become available.\n\nIn this talk, I'll discuss some of the reasons for doing migrations that impact hundreds of thousands of files, and how we do them at Google, using tools such as ClangMR. I'll give examples, such as our recent migration to the standardized std::unique_ptr and std::shared_ptr types and lessons we've learned from these experiences. Finally, I'll point out pitfalls others may face in doing similar work, and suggest ways that they can be avoided.\n--\nHyrum Wright hates C++ less than the rest of the programming languages he's worked with, and works on C++ library infrastructure at Google. He writes programs to rewrite other programs, and will eventually put himself out of a job. In a former life, he was an author of Apache Subversion, and still retains membership in the Apache Software Foundation. Hyrum enjoys cycling, but didn't bring a bike to Seattle.
