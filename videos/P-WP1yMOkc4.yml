language: English
recordingDate: 1588180024
description: "In this 2020 GDC Virtual Talk, Roblox's Maciej Mizerski describes  how to use a direct matrix solver based on LDL matrix decomposition in tandem with a PGS solver (a.k.a. Sequential Impulse solver) to improve the stability of degenerate systems of constraints and rigid bodies in Roblox. \n\nJoin the GDC mailing list: http://www.gdconf.com/subscribe\n\nFollow GDC on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Official_GDC \n\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
