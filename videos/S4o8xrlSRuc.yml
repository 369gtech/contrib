description: "John Willis, Director of Ecosystem Development, Docker\n\nContainers are all the buzz today. In this session we will look at the history of containerization and explain why there is so much discussion and activity around this model that has been around for years. We will look at the extended echo system of container which will include Docker as well as some other interesting alternatives. We will also demystify the subject matter of orchestration of containers looking at popular models such as Docker’s Swarm, Google’s Kubernetes and Mesosphere. Finally we will expand on some popular use cases and discuss the future of this phenomenon. No prior experience in necessary to attend this session."
