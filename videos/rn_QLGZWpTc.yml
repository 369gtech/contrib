title: 'Growth and Mentorship: Working with Junior Developers'
language: English

description: "Jon Daniel presenting.\n\nWorking with Junior Developers can be very difficult and a bit of a time sink. Do you just give them busy work? Do you hand them large projects and tell them to \"sink or swim\"? How do you make sure they are working effectively without losing all of your productive hours? How do you ensure code quality without deterring them from trying new things? Are they even worth having or will they just be a net loss for the company?\n\n\nThese are questions many of us have dealt with and often struggle to answer. After mentoring a number of Junior developers over the years, I have found some methods that work and some that don't. Let's have a discussion and see if we can fix this area of our industry.\n\nhttp://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-Code-Supply/events/232435376/ \n\nPresented at Code & Supply"
