With the creation of both Eclipse MicroProfile, Eclipse OpenJ9, and more projects, the Eclipse Foundation has become the place to be for Enterprise Java technologies.\n\nIt will really be a landscape change for you whether you're a Java developer or architect, using Java EE full profile or the web profile or even Spring(Boot). All the Java EE technologies and processes become truly open source, including:\n\nthe reference implementations (Glassfish will be released as Eclipse GlassFish, Jersey as Eclipse Jersey...),\nthe Technology Compatibility Kits (TCK) and Compatibility Test Suites (CTS) will certify compliance of implementations (WildFly, OpenLiberty, TomEE, ...) against future Jakarta EE releases,\nand the 40+ specifications will now be managed in the open, according to the Eclipse Specification Process.\nCome and learn how you can join the community building the future of Cloud Native Java.\n\nGaël Blondelle \nFrom Eclipse Foundation\nDirector of the Eclipse Foundation in Europe, Gaël Blondelle has been involved in open source since 2004 with the constant desire to encourage companies to consider open source as the best way to implement open innovation and open collaboration. In the last 15 years, Gaël has been the creator of a startup supporting an open source ESB, business developer of open source code generation and design tools for an SME, manager of a European research project aiming to create a business-friendly open source ecosystem for industrial players, then director at the Eclipse Foundation. Since Java EE migrated to the Eclipse ecosystem under the name of Jakarta EE, Gaël is delighted to be more involve in the enterprise Java ecosystem again!"
