title: 'Jessie Shternshus - “It’s all a matter of Perspective.” Incorporating Play to Help Solve Problems'
language: English
recordingDate: 1429406087
description: "To encourage open-ended behaviour and flip perspective on a problem, it is important to incorporate play. Jessie’s learned a lot about how to infuse play into problem solving through a lifetime of doing and teaching applied improvisation, and through watching how her children look at the world. This interactive talk will be about her personal narrative at home and at work, and on how we can use play to be better problem solvers. Jessie will teach you a couple of techniques that you can employ after you leave FITC and get back to your desk.\n\nJessie Shternshus\nFounder, The Improv Effect\nhttps://twitter.com/TheImprovEffect\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
