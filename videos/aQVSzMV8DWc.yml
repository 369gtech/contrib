title: 'YOW! 2011 Jim Webber - Domain-Driven Design for RESTful Systems'

description: "In this talk we'll explore the intersection of REST and DDD. Starting with a typical hypermedia workflow, we'll work through the mechanics of the Web and see how many common-sense distributed systems design principles are inverted as we design to increase surface area, scale, improve availability and compose services without breaking a sweat. We'll discuss how the Web transacts work strictly by side effects rather than explicit commands, and how it is optimised for repeatable, scalable queries. Finally we'll think through how aggregates work in a system where centralised control is impossible and federation is not only encouraged but normal.\n\nDr. Jim Webber is Chief Scientist with Neo Technology the company behind the popular open source graph database Neo4j, where he works on graph database server technology and writes open source software. Jim is interested in using big graphs like the Web for building distributed systems, which led him to being a co-author on the book \"REST in Practice\", having previously written \"Developing Enterprise Web Services - An Architect's Guide.\" Jim is an active speaker, presenting regularly around the world.\n\nFor more on YOW!
