This is, however, only one side of the coin: We need to first define criteria for slicing our application into individual parts and we must establish rules for communication between them. \n\nThis webinar looks at a solution provided by Strategic Domain-Driven Design. Using an Angular-based case study, we investigate the idea of the ubiquitous language and the bounded context, sub-domains, and context mapping. Building on this, you will learn how to implement these ideas for Angular using Nx monorepos. We also discuss approaches for reducing coupling between the specific parts of our monorepo and for enforcing your architecture.\n\nBy the end, you will have a technical solution and appropriate methodology to build sustainable Angular solutions."
