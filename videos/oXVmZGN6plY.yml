description: "Raphaël Merx\n\nhttps://2018.pycon-au.org/talks/44562-unicode-and-python-the-absolute-minimum-you-need-to-know/\n\nBorn from parents who don't mind string encoding, my name has an \"ë\". How can your code handle that character? How does Unicode handle it? If you see \"ë\" in a stack trace, does that mean your encoding is broken?\r\n\r\nIgnoring unicode often backfires. This talk is about preventing Unicode burns.\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, australia, programming, sydney\n\nThis video is licensed under CC BY 3.0 AU - https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/au/\r\n\r\nPyCon Australia (“PyCon AU”) is the national conference for the Python Programming Community, bringing together professional, student and enthusiast developers with a love for developing with Python.\n\nPyCon AU, the national Python Language conference, is on again this August in Sydney, at the International Convention Centre, Sydney, August 24 - 28 2018.\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU"
