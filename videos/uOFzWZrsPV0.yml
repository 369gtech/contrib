description: "Google I/O 2009 - Google Wave: Under the hood\r\n\r\nCasey Whitelaw, Dan Danilatos, Alex Mah, David Wang\r\n\r\nWe will explore the technology stack underlying Google Wave, from the bottom up. Google Wave's real-time collaboration is based on operational transformation algorithms, which we extended to support our data model of structured data and annotations. Our AJAX editor renders wave content and sends and receives fine-grained changes down to the level of keystrokes. Our context-sensitive spelling system shows how this stack enables new kinds of interactivity.\r\n\r\nFor presentation slides and all I/O sessions, please go to: code.google.com/events/io/sessions.html"
