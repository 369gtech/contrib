description: '#Codemotion Rome 2018 - “organizations which design systems ... are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations” — Melvin Conway, 1967 Microservices is an architectural shift, a huge topic that demands change in every aspect of software delivery. It is also more than a technical problem — your microservices architecture can be as solid and efficient as your team communication. This talk tries to describe the human aspect of implementing a microservices approach, and how this affects team communication.'
