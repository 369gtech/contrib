recordingDate: 1446789453
description: "Everyone loves to use the phrase wearable tech–and to talk about how many billions there are to be made–but if wearables are so great, why do they all suck? Author and fashion tech strategist Liza Kindred takes a look at the missteps so far and proposes a new way that finally goes beyond strapping a screen on your wrist–or throwing a sensor in a bracelet. Explore an eye-opening set of design principles and opportunities that go beyond novelty or technology for technology’s sake. Learn how to create real insight, joy, and utility with this most personal of technologies—for broadcast, interaction, privacy, tracking, and more. Find out why it’s important to think beyond screens and to consider the crucial roles of fashion, utility, fun, and sustainability in your product concept. The landscape is fractured, the technology is burgeoning, & the real adoption is just getting started. Liza shares a corrective vision for how to make the most of the amazing opportunity—instead of creating more glassholes.\n\nLiza Kindred is the founder of the fashion tech think tank Third Wave Fashion and the editor-in-chief of Third Wave Magazine. She works with fashion brands, technology companies, and publishers to help them do amazing things with fashion, tech, and wearables.

She is the author of two books out this year: “How We Buy Now” The Future of Commerce” (O’Reilly) and “Designing for Wearable Tech and Connected Devices” with Josh Clark.
