description: "After a slight hibernation, the SF Scala User Group is back, and it's stronger than ever! Adriaan Moors, Scala Tech Lead at Typesafe, starts its rebirth off with a bang, beginning his talk with a straightforward and possibly controversial idea: Scala is simple. To support his argument, he offers evidence to the contrary, and then refutes that evidence in order to make a full circle connection to his claim. \n\nThis talk is a comprehensive look at Scala 2.10 featuring multiple examples, code demos, and aspects worth highlighting. What has changed, and upgraded in 2.10, and what are the details of those changes?\n\n**Check out our stream of videos on other topics in Scala: http://marakana.com/s/tags/scala"
