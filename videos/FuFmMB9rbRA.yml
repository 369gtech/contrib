description: "Crimson: A New Ceph OSD for the Age of Persistent Memory and Fast NVMe Storage\n\nSamuel Just, Red Hat\n\nThe Crimson project is an effort to build a replacement ceph-osd daemon well suited to the new reality of low latency, high throughput persistent memory and NVMe technologies. Built on the seastar C++ framework, crimson-osd aims to be able to fully exploit these devices by minimizing latency, cpu overhead, and cross-core communication. This talk will discuss the design, current status, and future direction of the crimson project.\n\nView the full Vault '20 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/vault20/program"
