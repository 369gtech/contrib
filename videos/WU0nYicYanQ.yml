description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nPredictable Performance Through Prometheus and Topology Aware Scheduling - Killian Muldoon, Intel & Tom Golway, Hewlett Packard Enterprise \n\nThe Kubernetes scheduler does an excellent job scheduling cloud native workloads but the same isn’t true for performance sensitive workloads. Scheduling based on Topology of hardware resources is currently impossible due to the scheduler’s lack of knowledge of node topology. Resulting performance is less predictable, and advanced scheduling strategies – such as trait based placement– are blocked. Topology Manager in kubelet aligns topology-based resource allocations from CPU and Device Manager but only after workloads are scheduled. With Observability tools becoming popular we solve this problem using Prometheus and custom scheduling enhancements.   The focus of this talk is Topology Aware Scheduling and we discuss how exposing cluster level topology to the scheduler, and using Prometheus to track NUMA topology related metrics, enhances the default scheduler, empowering it to proactively use node level topology to make intelligent NUMA aware placement decisions leading to more effective cluster wide performance of workloads.\n\nhttps://sched.co/ZeqI"
