description: "Наша группа в ФБ: https://www.facebook.com/qafest/\nНаш сайт: www.qafest.com\n\nДоклад на конференции QA Fest 2017 в Киеве.\nIf the future of testing is AI, I will show you how. \nVarious automation tools are available, but due to high creation and maintenance efforts for tests, GUI-Testing is still mainly a manual task. Meanwhile overall testing effort has risen to make up 30% of a typical software budget. Is crowd-testing the answer? What if we could have automated test cases be created automatically? \nMonkey Testing is not a new idea. But combined with a manually trainable AI and an innovative new testing approach (dubbed \"\"difference testing\"\"), we can now not only have the monkey search for technical bugs (i.e. crashes) but generate functional test cases that are optimized towards several goals and are even better than manually created ones. \nVisit the future of testing and see how AI can help us create better software!"
