language: English
recordingDate: 1598238089
description: 'Modern aircraft heavily rely on several wireless technologies for communications control and navigation. Researchers demonstrated vulnerabilities in many aviation systems e.g., spoofing ILS signals to disrupt the landing, injecting ghost aircraft into airspace, spoof locations, and manipulate key communication messages. This presentation will give the viewers a better understanding of the fundamental problems associated with these critical systems and what makes spoofing attacks possible.'
