description: "RubyConf 2019 - What's Love Got To Do With It? Ruby and Sentiment Analysis by Ben Greenberg\n\nThe societies we live in, the companies we work for, the media we consume and much more are all shaped by words. Words can infuriate, enlighten, bring joy or cause great despair. Natural Language Understanding gives us a window into analyzing the words that surround us for sentiment and tone.\n\nHow does Natural Language Understanding work? What insights can we glean from the data it provides?\r\n\nWe will take a dive into understanding how this technology works, and apply it in a Ruby app that connects Natural Language Understanding analysis, the daily headlines and social media all in one. Get ready to learn some Ruby, some human language insights and how they all intertwine!\n\n#rubyconf2019 #confreaks"
