title: 'Embedded Fest 2021.Bradley Corrion. Innovating at the Edge with Open Source Software'
language: Russian
recordingDate: 1638785098
description: "The talk from Embedded Fest 2021 ONLINE\nFb: https://www.facebook.com/EmbeddedFest/\nWebsite: https://www.embeddedfest.com\n\nThis talk will cover how to combine open source ingredients into basic building blocks that can be applied to most edge analytics innovations. The idea is to inspire the audience of developers on how \"the edge\" redefines embedded computing, as well as the top cloud-related projects that can extend cloud-native and DevOps practices to remote, edge-based compute platforms. I'll cover building blocks that accelerate analytics, application packaging, device deployment, orchestration and clustering that can be used from the simplest to the most complex deployments. Hopefully by the end the audience will understand what is available to start experimenting, what projects Intel is contributing to, and what vendors are able to provide some commercial support."
