description: "PyCon Belarus 2019, Minsk\nPython Track \n\nDestination Python - Ewa Jodlowska\nPicture your favorite vacation destination. There's probably a community that is unique to it and elements of this community that make it welcoming. If Python had it's own island that we'd all go visit from time to time, how would we want that community to look? \n\nPython's popularity is global and every community within Python's ecosystem is unique. But, we all share a major common interest! In this talk we will discuss core elements that are essential to the sustainability of Python and it's community. This talk will also highlight the PSF's involvement in the Python community and we'll discuss updates in Python governance.\n\nVideo Partner â€“ Wargaming (https://wargaming.com/ru/)"
