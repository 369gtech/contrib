description: "Wayne Piekarski introduces the new Google Cast SDK, version 3. The new Cast SDK simplifies several complex parts of the previous SDK and addresses the major pain points identified by content partners and developers. It reduces the amount of code needed to Cast-enable your app, and provides a consistent API across Android and iOS, with Chrome following later.\n\nGoogle Cast Developers: https://goo.gl/ThLwW0\nGoogle Cast G+ Community: https://g.co/googlecastdev\nWayne Piekarski: https://google.com/+WaynePiekarski"
