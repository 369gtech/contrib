description: "The only meaningful measurement for a leader is whether the team succeeds or fails. Nothing else matters. In fact, everything you currently believe is valuable is simply a byproduct of you, as a leader, creating an environment where success is inevitable. But to achieve this state, organisations need to approach people, leadership, hierarchy, management and delivery very differently. Human systems and Agile environments are at their very best, non-linear and fluid. Loosely coupled networks replace rigid structures and reporting lines. Traditional management is simply ineffective and counter-productive in this space. We need a fundamentally new approach to people dynamics to succeed. Part of that journey is embracing extreme leadership. - Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/stretch\n\nhttp://www.stretchcon.com/"
