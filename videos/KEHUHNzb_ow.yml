description: "Spring makes data access easy and portable. Regardless of whether you want to work with straight JDBC, or higher level ORM technologies like JPA, Spring offers powerful abstractions and APIs that remove the tedious boilerplate code, leverage proven patterns and practices, reducing errors related to repetitive coding, empowering you to focus on the essence of your application. Spring Data's Repositories simplify the tasks even further, letting you build queries based entirely on convention, eliminating the need to write data access code at all. RESTful service tiers can also extend your data access layer to any environment. Spring Data REST makes short work of exposing repositories built with Spring through REST endpoints, again driven by convention. Join Mark Pollack for a look at the data access features in Spring and Spring Data, including: \nSpring core's JDBC and ORM support \nSpring Data JPA Repositories \nSpring Data REST for exposing repositories through REST endpoints \n\nAttendees will conclude the session able to leverage relational data in a simple, powerful, and portable manner using Spring's powerful APIs and abstractions."
