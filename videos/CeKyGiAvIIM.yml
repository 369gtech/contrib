description: "We all know that an open and generative culture is key to building successful Agile, Lean, and DevOps teams that deliver faster and build the right software and systems. But the process of change is difficult and painful.\n\nAgile Conversations presents a powerful and simple way to transform your culture through the power of conversation. With regular practice and consistent effort, we can learn new skills and build productive relationships. But how can we get that practice?\n\nOne solution is to hold a Conversational Dojo, a practice session where a group deliberately practices their conversational skills.\n\nIn this interactive webinar, Agile Conversations authors Douglas Squirrel and Jeffrey Fredrick will describe their techniques developed over years of practice sessions.\n\nJoin us to learn:\n- How to structure and lead a Conversational Dojo for group study.\n- Tips for both in-person and virtual dojos.\n- Why a piece of paper folded in half is a vital resource.\n- How to introduce these ideas to colleagues who are new to Agile Conversations.\n\nFree downloadable Conversational Dojo kit: https://itrevolution.com/conversational-dojo-kit-free-download/\n\nAbout the hosts:\n\nDouglas Squirrel has been coding for 40 years and has led software teams for 20.
