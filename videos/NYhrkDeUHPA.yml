recordingDate: 1615583990
description: "Presented at droidcon Italy 2020\n\nUNIT TEST YOUR VIEWS\nJorge D. Ortiz Fuentes, Founder, Canonical Examples\n\nThis is a hands on workshop to learn how to fully test your app, focusing on the view part of the architecture without using instrumentation. In this session, Jorge will share a simple but well-architected application using Android Architecture Components. Then, he will use Robolectric, ActivityScenario and FragmentScenario for writing the tests with you. You will discover how good architecture helps to test, but not from a theoretical perspective, but by actually writing unit tests for the different pieces of the application. This is an important first step towards achieving real continuous integration and improving the quality of your apps.\n\nhttps://it.droidcon.com/2020/​​​​\nhttps://twitter.com/Droidconit​​​​\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/showcase/droidcon-italy\nhttps://www.instagram.com/droidconit/​​​​\nhttps://www.facebook.com/droidconIt"
