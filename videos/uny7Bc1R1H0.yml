Lastly, this talk offers code translation as one strategy for counter-hegemonic resistance.\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo demonstrate the dominance of OOP languages and provide strategies to counter it.\n\nAUDIENCE\nAnyone building OTP applications.\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nhistory programming languages\n\nTALK LEVEL: Beginner\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - Osa Gaius\nEngineer Focused on Product and Distributed Systems - Mailchimp\n\nOsa Gaius is a Software Engineer at Mailchimp.
