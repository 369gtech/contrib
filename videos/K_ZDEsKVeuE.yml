recordingDate: 1404927007
description: "Pixel Painter\" Hal Lasko spoke to a full house at FITC Toronto in an intimate chat discussing the nature of art, technology, and the freedom of limitations. What does it mean to be born in 1916 and become Internet famous? How do analogue skills relate to their digital counterparts? What is it like to be almost blind and still make art? And what gets him up every morning to put in 10 hours a day painting pixels?\n\nPrepare to be inspired."
