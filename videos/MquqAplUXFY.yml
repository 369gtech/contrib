description: "Heard of acronyms likes BTB, KTB and WTB but haven't had a chance to dive head first into all the glorious testing features in Drupal 8? This session is for you. In this session, we'll look at the various types of tests you might want to write for development on Drupal core, a contributed project or even bespoke Drupal sites.\n\nAttending this session, developers can expect to see:\n\n\n\nReal world examples of awesome tests from core and contrib and how to write them.\nReal world examples of terrible tests from core and contrib and how to avoid writing them.\nA look at the whole spectrum of testing from unit testing to functional JavaScript testing.\nTried and tested tools and patterns being used to test core contrib today. No fluffly stuff.\nIf you've ever hesitated about a Friday deployment, or weren't quite sure if you broke something in your last release, we need to talk! I want all Drupal developers to have the confidence to hit that deploy button, take a long lunch, run some errands and return to a successful release with stakeholders singing songs of your triumph."
