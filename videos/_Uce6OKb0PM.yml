Many programmers also agree that this problem is hard to tackle or have no idea where to start. This talk aims to share our experiences of improving 10-year legacy codebase by introducing tests, tests & tests. \n\nIn this talk, you'll hopefully learn something about the following things:\n• How to broach the subject with your manager and not get laughed at\n• Possible avenues of attack on the beast itself\n• Common pitfalls that await those who dare to push through with this \n• Tips and tricks that may (or may not come in handy)\n\nPresentation: https://yadi.sk/d/LnIW-tQn7ielXw\n\nVideo Partner – Wargaming (https://wargaming.com/ru/)"
