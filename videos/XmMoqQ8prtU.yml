description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nKeynote: Like a Magic Eye Illusion: Seeing the Bigger Picture for Cloud-Native Security- Kirsten Newcomer, Director Cloud Security, Red Hat\n\nIn recent years, the cloud-native community has successfully built a shared understanding of what is needed to effectively secure cloud-native infrastructure and applications. Contributions from SIGs, working groups, individuals, and CNCF members to key initiatives such as the Kubernetes security audit, industry benchmarks, and open source projects provide a foundation for tackling the various layers of cloud-native security, including approaches such as “shift left.” At the same time, the work required to adopt “best practices” and create alignment across teams can seem daunting for even the most seasoned security and DevOps teams. This session aims to help the audience get a better sense of the state of cloud-native security today. It will highlight the latest developments in Kubernetes and container security as well as where organizations have been more and less successful in adjusting security practices to be cloud-native. It will also share results from a recent industry survey on Kubernetes security, some of the biggest open questions for the community, and where we can expect to go from here."
