title: 'YOW! 2014 Gojko Adzic - Make Impacts, Not Software'
recordingDate: 1514468509
description: "Software is everywhere today, and countless software products and projects die a slow death without ever making any impact. Today’s planning and roadmap techniques expect the world to stand still while we deliver, and set products and projects up for failure from the very start. Even when they have good strategic plans, many organisations fail to communicate them and align everyone involved in delivery. The result is a tremendous amount of time and money wasted due to wrong assumptions, lack of focus, poor communication of objectives, lack of understanding and misalignment with overall goals. There has to be a better way to deliver! Gojko presents a possible solution, impact mapping, an innovative strategic planning method that can help you make an impact with software.\n\nGojko specialises in agile and lean quality improvement, in particular agile testing, specification by example and behaviour driven development. His award winning book ‘Specification by Example’ won a best book Jolt Award and was #2 on the top 100 agile books for 2012.\n\nIn 2011, he was voted by peers as the most influential agile testing professional, and his blog won the UK agile award for the best online publication in 2010.\n\nHe is the author of ‘Impact Mapping’, ‘Specification by Example’, ‘Bridging the Communication Gap’, ‘Test Driven .NET Development with FitNesse’ and ‘50 Quick Ideas to Improve your User Stories’.\n\nFor more on YOW!
