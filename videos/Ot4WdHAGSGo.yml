title: 'Concepts Extending C++ Templates For Generic Programming'

description: "Google Tech Talks\nFebruary 21, 2007\n\nABSTRACT:\n\nConcepts are a major addition to C++0x that make templates more robust, more powerful, and easier to write and use. At their most basic level, concepts provide a type system for templates. Using concepts, the C++ compiler is able to detect errors in the definition and use of templates before they are instantiated. One immediately obvious benefit of this separate type-checking capability is a dramatic improvement in error messages resulting from improper use of templates. Look a little deeper and we find that concepts support an entirely new programming paradigm, Generic Programming, enabling the construction of a new breed of generic libraries that..."
