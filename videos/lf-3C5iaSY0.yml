description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Chicago 2014\nhttp://gotochgo.com\n\nTim Bray - Father of XML - Uncle of Search Engines\n\nABSTRACT\nThe proportion of traffic going to mobile devices continues to increase inexorably. The time has come to ask: Will that increase ever stop? Are there application areas that are safe from being overrun by native mobile apps, or is the browser a dead end in 2014? And finally: Should we even care? Does the browser have any advantages that actually matter? \n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotochgo\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
