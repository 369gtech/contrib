description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nKubeVirt Intro – Using KubeVirt to Run VMs at Scale - Fabian Deutsch, Red Hat & Marcus Sorensen, Apple \n\nThis session will provide an intro into the KubeVirt project, which enables Kubernetes to run virtual machine workloads alongside containers. This provides a unified development platform where developers can build, modify, and deploy applications made up of both application containers as well as virtual machines in a common, shared environment. In the session, you will learn more about why KubeVirt exists, how people are using it today, and how the project actually works from an architectural perspective. You will also see a short demo of the project in action! Finally, you will hear about future plans for developing KubeVirt’s capabilities that are emerging from the community.\n\nhttps://sched.co/ZevE"
