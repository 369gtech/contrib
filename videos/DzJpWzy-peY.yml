title: 'YOW! Perth 2019 - Stewart Gleadow - Scaling Mobile at REA'
recordingDate: 1571115675
description: "Over the last 9 years, REA's native mobile development has grown from a small team off to the side to an important company-wide channel. In a world where almost every new product needs a presence in our mobile apps, we've been making changes to allow us to build for mobile at scale. REA has effectively scaled technology through practices like microservices, micro frontends and continuous delivery. While these all look different for mobile apps, there are elements of each that we have adapted and applied with good effect. We are applying a software architecture, as well as building out mobile platform capability to help us effectively deliver new mobile experiences weekly with many independent teams involved.\n\nStewart Gleadow is a senior technical lead working as part of the architecture team across REA Group's products, with a focus on their mobile app capability, looking at the organisational and technical challenges of building software at scale. He's been involved in mobile app development for 9 years, including the very first realestate.com.au iPhone app in 2010.\n\nPrevious to working in software architecture at REA, Stewart has held engineering management, tech lead and consulting roles at a number of well known Australian companies. He's worked with a number of high profile Australian companies helping to create quality mobile applications, APIs and build high performing development teams.\n\nFor more on YOW!
