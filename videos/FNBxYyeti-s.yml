description: "\"An ASGI Server from scratch\nEuroPython 2020 - Talk - 2020-07-23 - Brian\nOnline\n\nBy Philip Jones\n\nI intend for this to be a fairly advanced talk that shows the steps required to go from a TCP echo server to a basic HTTP/1 ASGI server using asyncio for the IO. This is aimed at people who've read about asyncio, coroutines, etc and want to see them used in practice.\n\nThis is a tutorial on how to build a HTTP/1 ASGI server using asyncio. I plan to start by building a TCP echo server and then add HTTP parsing and ASGI compliance.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2020.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/\n\n    \""
