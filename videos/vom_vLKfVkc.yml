To fully exploit the power of gRPC-Go and be able to debug issues, one needs knowledge about how gRPC-Go is designed, the various support it provides and the flexibility of customization it offers. This presentation will dive into the architecture of gRPC-Go, mainly the surface (gRPC) layer, transport layer, resolver component and balancer component. It will also include a brief introduction to key gRPC features such as binary logging, channelz (runtime debugging), service config and rpc retry along the way. \n\nTo learn more click here:  https://sched.co/FuLX"
