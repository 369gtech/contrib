description: "In this show I talks with Brent Stewart about making things with metal. We dive in CNC machines and explore his journey with getting a semi-professional grade CNC machine.\n\nBrent is a professional software developer with over two decades of experience, Brent has seen many development trends come and go and learned that there is not a shortcut to being a great developer. He enjoys teaching and tries to mentor others whenever he can. When he is not speaking at conferences around the Midwest he can be found helping organize the Kansas City .NET User Group.\nHe is a creator at heart and has started multiple businesses over the years in a variety of industries. His latest venture is Alien Arc Technologies which allows him to take his ideas and give them form. He loves quality in all things and always try to provide the best quality in everything he does. If it is worth doing, then it is worth doing right.\n\nTwitter: @brentestewart\nGithub: @brentestewart\nWebsite: brentstewart.net\n\nLinks mentioned in today’s show:\nhttps://www.tormach.com/ - The maker of the CNC that I have (I have the CNC 770)\nhttp://www.cnczone.com – A forum where I do a lot of lurking\nhttp://www.onlinemetals.com – Online metal supplier\nhttps://www.alphaknifesupply.com – Knife materials"
