description: "Speaker: Gabriela Ferrara, Google\n\nML is for people with PhD, right? Actually, no. ML is for regular developers too! You can make use from “pre-baked” trained models that Google offers through their set of APIs, or even train a custom model with Auto ML without knowing anything about Machine Learning or TensorFlow code. After all, it’s just an API call!\n\nAbout the speaker\n\nGabi is a Developer Advocate on Google Cloud and a passionate Software Engineer. She likes simplifying complex systems, and believes abstractions are best when they can be understood in a real life example. She’s driven to go beyond DBA lingo to make database and storage technology more accessible to software developers.\n\nEvent Page: https://2018.phpconf.asia\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/lcA0/"
