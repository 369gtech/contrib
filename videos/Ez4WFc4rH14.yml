description: 'Have you ever thought that dabbling in SVG and animating it might be a cumbersome part of your work? Probably yes. To be honest, I had thought the same before I actually started playing with it. During my presentation I''ll tell you why SVG is so hyped and powerful right now, giving you a couple of creative and fun examples. I''ll also show you how to easily animate SVG using simple CSS animations, which advantages SVG has over other formats and finally I''ll shed a light on SVG''s accessibility.'
