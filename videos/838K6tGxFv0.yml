title: 'Creating a Java Internet of Things Gateway'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433232981
description: "Internet of Things adoption is constrained by disparate implementations and proprietary solutions. The emergence of a service gateway model operating on the edge of a deployment as an aggregator and controller has opened up the possibility of enabling enterprise-level technologies in the world of the Internet of Things. This session discusses and demonstrates Eclipse Kura, a Java- and OSGi-based application framework for service gateways. Kura abstracts and isolates the developer from the complexity of the hardware subsystems and ensures application portability across architectures. Kura built-in components are configurable services covering the most-common building blocks for Internet of Things applications such as I/O access, network configuration, data services, and remote management.\n\n\nAuthors:\nDavid Woodard\nNo bio available\nView more trainings by David Woodard at https://www.parleys.com/author/david-woodard\n\n Wes Johnson\nNo bio available\nView more trainings by  Wes Johnson at https://www.parleys.com/author/wes-johnson\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
