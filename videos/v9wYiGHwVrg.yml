description: "Deep Dive: Falco - Mark Stemm, Sysdig \n\nIn any Cloud Native architecture, there’s a seemingly endless stream of events that happen at each layer. These events can be used to detect abnormal activity and possible security incidents, as well as providing an audit trail of activity. In this talk, we’ll cover how we extended Falco to ingest events beyond just host system calls, such as Kubernetes audit events or even application level events. We will also show how to create Falco rules to detect behaviors in these new event streams. We show how we implemented Kubernetes audit events in Falco, and how to configure the event stream. Finally, we will cover how to create additional event streams leveraging the generic implementation Falco provides. Attendees will gain a deep understanding of Falco’s architecture, and how it custom Falco for additional events sources.  \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/I1p9"
