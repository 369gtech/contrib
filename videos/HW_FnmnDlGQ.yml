description: "C# 8.0 is coming up! Not just nullable reference types and asynchronous streams, which will get much coverage elsewhere in the conference, but also recursive patterns, switch expressions, ranges, default interface member implementations and more.\n\nWeâ€™ll look at all of those, and also at some of the things being worked on for future versions of the language.\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
