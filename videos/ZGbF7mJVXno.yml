title: 'Tanzu Tuesdays - A Deep Dive into Spring Application Events with Oliver Drotbohm'
language: English
recordingDate: 1612990174
description: "Events have become a key element of modern application design especially when it comes to distributed applications. But also in monolithic applications they can be used to improve modularity as Spring’s ApplicationEvent abstraction and the associated infrastructure components make it easy to design, publish and consume events. \n\nThe talks starts by giving an overview about the building blocks of Spring’s core event infrastructure. It continues with an example of how to decouple Spring components using events, discusses different ways of implementing a variety of interaction scenarios and how Spring Data allows to take a more domain-driven approach to event publication. We end up by discussing advanced event handling scenarios and failure handling.\n\n---\n\nOliver Drotbohm is Senior Principal Software Engineer at VMware, Java Champion and member of the JPA 2.1 expert group. He has been into developing enterprise applications and open source projects for over 15 years now. His working focus is centered around software architecture, DDD, REST, and persistence technologies. He is regularly speaking at German and international conferences and the author of technology articles as well as the first book on Spring Data."
