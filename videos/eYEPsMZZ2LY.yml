description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nDiscussion & Comments: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2019\n—\nMost modern languages treat functions as first-class citizens, and Modern C++ is no different. The introduction of lambda expressions and utilities such as `std::function` enable countless functional programming patterns that can increase the flexibility and safety of APIs, and help reduce code repetition on the implementation side.\n\nIn this talk we're going to see examples of how higher-order functions can be used in practice to increase the quality of production code and the productivity of developers, focusing on pragmatic use cases that can be integrated in an existing codebase instead of fully functional patterns.\n\nA new abstraction proposed to the Standard Library for C++20, `function_ref`, will also be covered and compared to existing techniques for the implementation of higher-order functions.\n\n`function_ref` is a lightweight wrapper over any `Callable` with a given signature that is easy for the compiler to optimize and inline. This presentation will go over the specification and implementation of `function_ref`, covering potential future extensions and possible pitfalls.\n— \nVittorio Romeo\nBloomberg\nSoftware Engineer\nLondon, United Kingdom\n\nVittorio Romeo (B.Sc. Computer Science) has been a Software Engineer at Bloomberg for more than 3 years, working on mission-critical company C++ infrastructure and providing Modern C++ training to hundreds of fellow employees.\n\nHe began programming around the age of 8 and quickly became a C++ enthusiast. Vittorio created several open-source C++ libraries and games, published many video courses and tutorials, and actively participates in the ISO C++ standardization process.\n\nHe is also an active member of the C++ community and has an ardent desire to share his knowledge and learn from others: he presented more than 20 times at international C++ conferences (including CppCon, C++Now, ++it, ACCU, C++ On Sea, C++ Russia, and Meeting C++), covering topics of various nature.\n\nVittorio maintains a website with advanced C++ articles and a YouTube channel featuring well-received modern C++11/14 tutorials. Lastly, he’s active on StackOverflow, taking great care in answering interesting C++ question (60k reputation).\n\nWhen he’s not writing code, Vittorio enjoys weightlifting and fitness-related activities, competitive/challenging computer gaming and sci-fi movies/TV-series.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
