description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nCSI Volume Snapshots: On the Way to Faster and Better Backups - Adnan Abdulhussein & Nolan Brubaker, VMware \n\nUsers need persistent data to support their business goals, and regular backups are critical to business continuity. The CSI Snapshot API provides users a consistent way of creating volume snapshots within Kubernetes, regardless of their storage provider. This is a big improvement over the prior, provider-specific methods for creating snapshots.  This session will first cover the basic CSI Snapshot CRDs, as well as demo snapshotting and restoring a stateful application. Additionally, we'll share how disaster recovery tools, such as the open-source Velero, can build on CSI Snapshots, as well as future enhancements coming to CSI, and what migrations from current in-tree cloud provider implementations will look like.  Agenda: - Overview of the CSI Snapshot CRDs - Demo of snapshot and restore workflow - Future direction for application snapshotting and quiescing in CSI \n\nhttps://sched.co/UaXR"
