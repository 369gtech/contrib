description: "From the 2014 Solid Conference: Robotics is an emerging technology with a lot of confusion. As a student of human-robot culture and now the manager of the tech cluster for robotics in Silicon Valley, Andra Keay sees both the popular culture and the real world of research, startups and industry. Sometimes there is a gaping chasm between them. Andra's role is to help robotics cross that chasm, and on the way, perhaps also to help robotics to be more useful for more people.\n\nAbout Andra Keay (Silicon Valley Robotics)\nAndra Keay is a human systems engineer, Founder of Robot Launchpad, Managing Director of Silicon Valley Robotics and CoFounder of Robot Garden, a new robotics hackerspace. Andra is also Treasurer of the Robots Association and contributor to Robohub, the global site for news and views on robotics. She obtained her MA in Human-Robot Culture/Cultural Theory at the University of Sydney, Australia in 2011, building on a background as a robot hobbyist, STEM educator and film-maker.\n\nFor more information on the Solid Conference, visit http://solidcon.com.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to O'Reilly to get SolidCon videos as they release: http://goo.gl/szEauh\nStay Connected to O'Reilly Media by Email - http://goo.gl/YZSWbO\n\nFollow O'Reilly Media:\nhttp://plus.google.com/+oreillymedia\nhttps://www.facebook.com/OReilly\nhttps://twitter.com/OReillyMedia"
