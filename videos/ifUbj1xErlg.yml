description: "RubyConf 2019 - Introducing Rubyfmt by Penelope Phippen\n\nGo has gofmt, Rust: rustfmt, elixir: mix format, so what about Ruby? One response is Rubocop! A sometimes beloved, sometimes maligned formatting and linting tool. A design principle of Rubocop is configurability. So, what if we had a code formatter without configuration options?\n\r\n\nIn this talk, you’ll learn about my goals for Rubyfmt, my upcoming Ruby formatter. You’ll also get a guided tour through Ruby’s parser, and learn about why I’m rewriting the parser in Rust! This talk will get technical, and you should come if you want to learn more about Ruby’s parser and internals.\n\n#rubyconf2019 #confreaks"
