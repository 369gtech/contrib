Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nIs There a Place for Performance Sensitive Workloads in Kubernetes? - Gergely Csatari & Levente Kale, Nokia \n\nKubernetes and its ecosystem is used to manage the workload of several big web facing services, serving billions of users every day. But, the same stack is not quite ready to serve the \"other\" industry delivering the packets to the web-scale users: telecommunication. Due to the nature of the TelCo industry these applications are highly reliable and they must handle realtime media for a high amount of subscribers. There are some areas in the current Kubernetes architecture which are not -yet- ready to fulfill these requirements. This presentation lists these shortcomings, and also proposes various already existing, or new open-source projects needed to build a production-grade, Kubernetes based infrastructure for the edge - like it was done with Akraino Radio Edge cloud. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UaZx"
