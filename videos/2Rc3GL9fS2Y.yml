description: "We want to speed up Dijkstra's Algorithm by avoiding the linear O(n) scan through all unvisited notes. To do this we put our nodes in a heap, which allows us to always quickly access the fastest node.\n\nFind the source code here: https://github.com/BSVino/MathForGameDevelopers/tree/graph-heap\n\nNew video every Thursday.
