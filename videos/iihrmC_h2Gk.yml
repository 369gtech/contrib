description: "Most people we know (and like) value code clarity, and have strong & disparate opinions about what exactly that means. We build our programs carefully by curating collections of behaviors, naming those collections in ways we find clear–so why is dropping into some codebases so hellish, while with others it feels like running into an old friend?\n\nLaura is an iOS developer with a penchant for languages, travel, and education. She taught English in rural Korea and French in the environs of Microsoft before cutting her teeth as a mobile developer at an agency in Seattle. She’s now working to transform learning by building iOS apps at Khan Academy.\n\nFor more on YOW! Connected, visit http://connected.yowconference.com.au"
