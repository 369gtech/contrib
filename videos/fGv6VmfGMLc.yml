title: 'Convolutional Networks for Heart Disease Prediction (AlphaCare: Episode 1)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1629398981
description: "AlphaCare is an open-source project that Keshav Boudaria and I have been working on for the past few weeks, and it's built entirely on top of freely available open-source data, algorithms, and compute. In this first video of the AlphaCare series, I'll explain how we can use it to classify ECG data from patient heartbeats to accurately predict the likelihood of different types of heart disease, mainly Arrhythmia. The goal of AlphaCare is to progressively improve it's capabilities as a community until it's able to be used as a tool to treat and prevent the top 10 major disease globally. Ultimately, we'd like to use it to treat the root cause of all diseases, Aging. AlphaCare is a work in progress, we have a lot of work to do together. I can't wait to learn and grow with all of you, let's make a massive positive impact together! \n\nBig thanks to RapidAPI for sponsoring this video series:\nhttps://rapidapi.com/hub?utm_source=Siraj-Raval&utm_medium=DevRel&utm_campaign=DevRel\n\nCode & Coding Challenge:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/AlphaCare\n\nChallenge Submission Link:\nhttps://forms.gle/kBQJvfYzqEzWKUBJ9\n\nCredits:\nPhysik for his ECG Flask example app:\nhttps://github.com/physhik/ecg-mit-bih\nKhatri007 for his MIT BIH CNN example:\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/khatri007/mitbh-cnn\nmtobeiyf for his Keras-Flask starter app\nhttps://github.com/mtobeiyf/keras-flask-deploy-webapp\nRoger Faerick for the Wavelet example:\nhttps://gist.github.com/endolith/2783866\nNichaelPham for his ECG Visualization interface:\nhttps://github.com/nichealpham/cassandra-demo-app\nEastSideArrythmia for the surgery clip:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJXfsZiQWCY \nAlila Medical Media for the heart animation:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPqs4xKPG3A\n\nRapidAPI symptom checker:\nhttps://rapidapi.com/priaid/api/symptom-checker/\n\nMore Learning Resources:\n\nMy Medical Imaging Classification video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCcmFXXAHf4&\n\nMy CNN explainer:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTr3n7uBIuE&\n\nMIT Video on CNNs:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaSUYvmCekI \n\nHenry AI Labs Video on 3D CNNs:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcnKGMNyVu4\n\nECG Time Series Classification Video in PyTorch:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN3n0TM4Jno\n\nAwesome list of papers + code on ECG Classification:\nhttps://paperswithcode.com/task/ecg-classification\n\nList of awesome materials on Deep Learning in healthcare:\nhttps://github.com/XiaoleiZ/awesome-list-machine-learning-healthcare\n\nFree EdX course on ML in Healthcare:\nhttps://www.edx.org/course/machine-learning-for-healthcare\n\nAndrew Ng's Free Deep Learning courses:\nhttps://www.deeplearning.ai/\n\nDr David Sinclair at Harvard Medical's Book that inspired me:\nhttps://lifespanbook.com/ \n\nMy Math of Intelligence Playlist:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRJCOz3AfYY&list=PL2-dafEMk2A7mu0bSksCGMJEmeddU_H4D\n\nFree Book on Intro to Statistical Learning:\nhttps://www.statlearning.com/\n\nFollow me:\n\nINSTAGRAM:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/sirajraval/\n\nTWITTER:\nhttps://twitter.com/sirajraval\n\nFACEBOOK:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/sirajologyyy\n\nLINKEDIN:\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/sirajraval/\n\nTIKTOK (i'll start posting soon):\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@sirajraval?lang=en\n\nPlease subscribe for more programming videos!
