title: 'Java Memory Model Pragmatics (Aleksey Shipil?v, Russia), part 2'
language: Russian

description: "Java Memory Model (JMM) specification tries to be very concise yet complete. Because JMM tries to embrace a very large set of phenomenon, its formalism is very heavy, which unfortunately resulted in losing the “humanity” of the spec.\n\nIn this talk, we will follow the logic of the model; review what pragmatic results the model was trying to achieve; look closely at the real world limitations the model had to endure; see how JMM tries to balance between developers’ needs and runtime/hardware maintainers requests."
