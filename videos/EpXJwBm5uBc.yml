description: "The goal of this session is two-fold, i.e. explain what Java EE 8 brings today and understand where Java EE is going tomorrow with the recently announced move of Java EE to the Eclipse Foundation. We will start by covering in details the new capabilities added in Java EE 8: - JAX-RS 2.1’s new Reactive client API - Bean Validation 2.0 improvements - CDI 2.0 Asynchronous events - Servlet 4.0 HTTP/2 support - The addition of a new JSON Binding API - A new Security API... We will then conclude by discussing the move of Java EE to the Eclipse Foundation and what it exactly means for the platform and its relation with the MicroProfile.IO project. Attend this session to understand what Java EE 8 brings today and where Java EE is going tomorrow!\n\nDavid Delabassee, Oracle\nDavid Delabassée is a Software Evangelist working for Oracle; his primary focus is Java on the Server-Side from Java EE to Serverless.
