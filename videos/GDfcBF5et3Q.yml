description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nKubernetes SIG Docs: A Deep Dive - Jim Angel, Google; Chris Metz, Independent; Brad Topol, IBM\n\nThis session covers Kubernetes (K8s) documentation. We'll do an overview of the docs--how they're organized, and how they're maintained--then contribute to the docs ourselves. During the introduction, we'll look at the docs repository (kubernetes/website) and how we organize content. We'll also look at the website stack: how we preview and publish docs to kubernetes.io. We'll talk about the docs workflow: how SIG Docs does the work to review and publish docs. During the deep dive, we'll explore the docs contributor guide and do some hands-on contribution. Remember that contributing to docs is a pathway to Kubernetes membership!"
