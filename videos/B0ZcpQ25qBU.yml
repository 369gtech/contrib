title: 'Converged Database for Developers - Hands-on Lab'
language: English
recordingDate: 1633578092
description: 'The Oracle Database converges support for multiple data models and workloads into a single database, while supporting popular development tools and techniques like events and REST interfaces. As opposed to using multiple single purpose databases for each data type, using a converged database results in a unified data tier, enabling real-time analytics and machine learning on production data. You don''t need to manage and maintain multiple systems or worry about having to provide unified security across them. In this workshop, you will gain first-hand experience of using data types beyond relational data - JSON, XML, Spatial and Graph. #developers #oraclecloud #database'
