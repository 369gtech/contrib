title: 'Running AI on IoT microcontroller devices with ELL'

recordingDate: 1544712300
description: "How about designing and deploying intelligent machine-learned models onto resource constrained platforms and small single-board computers, like Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and micro:bit? How interesting would that be?\nThis is exactly what the open source Embedded Learning Library (ELL) project is about. The deployed models run locally, without requiring a network connection and without relying on servers in the cloud. ELL is an early preview of the embedded AI and machine learning technologies developed at Microsoft Research.\nChris Lovett from Microsoft Research gives us a fantastic demo of the project in this episode of the IoT Show.\nGet the ELL code on GitHub: https://github.com/microsoft/ell"
