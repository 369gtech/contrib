description: "Renan Ranelli - Rewriting critical software in Elixir - a case study\n\nTalk in three words: Rewrites are hard\n\nAbstract\nMost companies adopting Elixir start small, with a proof of concept or a rewrite of a non-critical service. At Telnyx, they chose the hard route: rewriting a high volume, highly available and economically-critical service. This talk will explore their strategy in doing so, what went well, what didn't, and what they wished they knew at the beginning.\n\nObjectives\nThe objective of this talk is to encourage developers to adopt Elixir at established companies and also feel confident about its merits (e.g. runtime, ecosystem, etc). At the same time, it intends to provide an impartial and clear engineering perspective, all based on real world experiences and examples.\n\nAudience\nDevelopers who need to rewrite existing software in Elixir. This talk is for developers who are thinking of adopting Elixir and/or rewriting a piece of software but are apprehensive because of possible problems.\n\nThe speaker \nRenan is a Brazilian software developer focused on backend, operations and databases. He has worked in companies both very large and very small and has been using Elixir since 2015. He currently works remotely for Telnyx LLC, a Chicago based company, whose mission is to democratise global communications. Renan speaks frequently at technology events in Brazil and abroad. In his spare time, he likes to cook, make cocktails and dance.\nGithub: rranelli\nTwitter: @renanranelli\n\nElixirConf EU\nWebsite: www.elixirconf.eu\nTwitter: www.twitter.com/elixirconfeu"
