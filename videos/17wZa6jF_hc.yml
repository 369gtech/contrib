description: "http://strataconf.com/\nMobile is already changing everything about the way we access information, and we've only begun to experience the impact of the smart devices revolution. Mobile analytics is also very different from web product analytics. With a variety of screen sizes, operating systems, and many other features, the \"mobile platform\" is in fact a multitude of distinct platforms. How do we recognize and even benefit from this richness and heterogeneity to create amazing products our users will love? Data science for consumer internet products relies on our ability to effectively analyze and understand ubiquitous computing in terms of a holistic product experience, as individuals consume and create data on mobile and desktop devices in their day-to-day lives. I'll talk about mobile data science challenges — from product development to data-driven decision making.\n\nhttp://strataconf.com/strata2013/public/schedule/detail/27605"
