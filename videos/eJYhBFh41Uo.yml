description: "We spend much of our time collecting and analyzing data. That data is only useful if it can be displayed in a meaningful, understandable way.\nYale professor Edward Tufte presented many ideas on how to effectively present data to an audience or end user.\n\nIn this session, I will explain some of Tufte's most important guidelines about data visualization and how you can apply those guidelines to your own data. You will learn what to include, what to remove, and what to avoid in your charts, graphs, maps and other images that represent data."
