Going from a simple, but elegant version we will incrementally improve it and reach a 10x improvement, without losing the structure and flow or significantly impacting the number of lines required.\n\nSlides & full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/johanna-larsson/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - JOHANNA LARSSON\nCo-organiser of Malm√∂ Elixir User Group, Elixir core contributor\n\nMore on Johanna Larsson: https://codesync.global/speaker/johanna-larsson/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CBL AMSTERDAM 19\nCBL AMSTERDAM is powered by Code Sync.
