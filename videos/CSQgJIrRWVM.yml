description: "by Dietrich Ayala\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/UD2.208/decentralizing_the_web_despite_itself.webm\n\n\nThe web is unimaginably large. Despite all recent challengers, it is still the most successful digital platform in human history. However, the web's centralized nature works against true user agency... and its success is one of the biggest barriers to changing it. Come learn about these challenges and about efforts by Mozilla and other projects to enable decentralized and distributed applications on the web today. \n\nRoom: UD2.208 (Decroly)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 18:00:00+01"
