But fear not - you can join the thousands of successful contributors too!\n\nIn this talk we’ll explore the different parts of Kubernetes and how they work, see how the various components are related, discuss the skills you need to get started and learn the best ways to get your first Pull Request accepted.\n\nYou don’t have to be an expert; even mere mortals like us can make contributions. This talk will also walk through how I implemented my Google Summer of Code project even though I was completely new to Kubernetes. Once you see how easy it is, you’ll want to do it too!\n\nAbout Nikhita Raghunath\nNikhita is a contributor to Kubernetes and is the tech lead for SIG Contributor Experience.
