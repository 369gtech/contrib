description: "Speaker: Soumith Chintala, Researcher, Facebook Research.\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/SessionsEvents/soumith-chintala-increasing-the-impact-of-ai-through-better-software\n\nThe state of artificial intelligence is continuing to advance rapidly, with breakthroughs in areas from reinforcement learning to generative adversarial networks holding the potential to transform how we go about our day-to-day. Learn about how modern software frameworks and tooling, paired with cutting edge hardware, are enabling researchers to take state-of-the-art research and deploy at scale in areas from autonomous vehicles to medical imaging. Weâ€™ll deep dive on the latest updates to the PyTorch deep learning framework, including distributed training, the C++ frontend, quantization, and new libraries to support development."
