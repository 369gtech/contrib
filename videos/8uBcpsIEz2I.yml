description: "Recorded at SpringOne 2GX 2012 in Washington, DC\nOne of the questions we get asked the most by developers and architects is: when and why would I use OAuth2? The answer, as often with such questions, is \"it depends\", but there are some features of OAuth2 that make it compelling in some situations, especially in systems composed of many lightweight web services, which becoming a very common architectural pattern.\n\nThis presentation will not go into a lot of detail about the OAuth2 protocol and related specifications, but will attempt to show some of the key features of a system secured with OAuth2 and the decision points when choosing to build such a system."
