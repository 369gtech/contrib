title: '"Web Apps without Web Servers" by Richard Feldman'
recordingDate: 1411281628
description: "How rich a Web application can you make without writing a line of server code? Thanks to modern HTML5 and JavaScript, this radical approach is now a viable option for serious projects. With static caches delivering your entire application at warp speed, more Web developers than ever can justifiably avoid the expense and complexity of an in-house server altogether.\n\nThis talk will cover the merits and drawbacks of server-free Web applications, as well as the technical details of how to create them. Learn how to build an entire writing app that users can bring up and use offline via the HTML5 app cache and in-browser persistence, then authenticate to sync their work through third-party APIs - all without writing a line of server code. Come see how far we can push the modern browser!\n\nRichard Feldman\n@rtfeldman\n\nRichard is a functional programmer who specializes in pushing the limits of browser-based UIs. He's built a framework that performantly renders hundreds of thousands of shapes in HTML5 canvas, a writing web app that functions like a desktop app in the absence of an Internet connection, and much more in between."
