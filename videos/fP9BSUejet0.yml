description: "Many organisations desperately want to enjoy the benefits of practising BDD, yet set themselves up for failure.\n\nGrowing new practices in your teams is a lot like growing plants: you need to create the right environment for the changes to take root and establish themselves. Did you ever bring one of those basil plants home from the supermarket, and three weeks later it was all limp and brown and, well, a bit dead?\n\nThat wasn’t the basil plant’s fault.\n\nMatt Wynne, co-founder of Cucumber, delivers a short webinar presentation on 10 easy ways to fail at BDD. \n\nWarning: Heavy irony throughout. \n\nhttps://medium.com/@mattwynne/10-easy-ways-to-fail-at-bdd-95a01cc53d63\n\nJoin us in Charlotte NC for our BDD open-space conference on Dec 12th-13th - https://cucumber.io/events/2018/12/12/cukenspace-charlotte"
