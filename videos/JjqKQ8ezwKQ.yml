Whether starting with a blank slate or an already implemented application (or somewhere in-between) being able to test your JavaScript code simply, cleanly, and effectively is a necessary feature.  Code that cannot be tested will be rewritten.\nWhile JavaScript is unique due to the myriad of environments within which it runs, there are several tried and true 'testable' methodologies from other languages which also hold true for JavaScript.  And of course there remain the unique challenges that JavaScript developers must face while writing and testing their code.\nWhat patterns make code testable?  Which anti-patterns hinder testing?  What metrics and common sense guideposts can be used to measure the testability of our code?  Once the process of creating testable code has started now what?\nJoin me to break down the process of writing testable JavaScript.  We will investigate ideas, patterns, and methodologies that greatly increase the testability, and hence the maintainability, correctness, and longevity of your code.  Whether you write client- or server-side JavaScript mastering this process will greatly enhance the quality of your code."
