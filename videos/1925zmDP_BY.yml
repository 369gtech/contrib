description: "So you're logging in to your favorite crypto currency exchange over https using a username and password, executing some transactions, and you're not at all surprised that, security wise, everything's hunky dory...\n\nThe amount of cryptography to make all this happen is staggering. In order to appreciate and understand what goes on under the hood, as a developer, it's really important to dive into the key concepts of cryptography .\n\nIn this session, we discover what cryptography actually is, and will use the JCA (Java Cryptography API) en JCE (Java Cryptography Extensions) in the JDK to explain and demo key concepts such as:\n\nMessage digests (hashing)\nEncryption, both symmetric and asymmetric\nDigital signatures, both symmetric and asymmetric\nFurthermore, we'll show how these concepts find their way into a variety of practical applications such as:\n\nhttps and certificates\nsalted password checking\nblock chain technology\nAfter this session, you'll have a better understanding of basic cryptography, its applications, and how to use the cryptography APIs in Java."
