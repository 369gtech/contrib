description: "How to ship code faster in production without sacrificing security? How to maintain consistency in CI/CD pipelines with growing fragmentation of Kubernetes? These are quintessential challenges faced by enterprises. DevOps practitioners need a mental model & actionable toolset to build robust software delivery pipelines.\n\nSecurity of containers starts with a secure base image. Tanzu Build Service automates code-to-container workflows. Rebase without a rebuild delivers CVE fixes at scale. Harbor is embedded in the CI/CD pipeline to further secure images with RBAC, scan for CVEs & sign images as trusted. Traffic management in Tanzu Service Mesh helps with canary deployments. Metrics driven canaries, Testcontainers and API contracts help improve reliability of pipelines. Weâ€™ll demonstrate a GitOps based path to prod using Argo.\n\nCome to this session to learn how Tanzu simplifies DevSecOps.\n\nMaria Gabriella Brodi: Sr. Solution Engineer at VMware\nPrasanna Upperi: Senior Platform Architect at VMware\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/devsecops-with-confidence"
