description: "What do you think when somebody tells you they don't know? Better stop wasting time? Not quite the expert you thought they were? Or perhaps you respect their honesty? Perhaps this opens the opportunity to explore the issue together and reach a better outcome without assumptions?\n\nWhat we can learn from those that admit they don't know might surprise you. I'll share some of the valuable insights I've gained from admitting there are things I didn't know and being prepared to try things with an open mind. I have seen many newcomers excel because they've admitted they don't know and many experienced people fail from refusing to admit the opposite.\n\nHaving joined a team that had finally been given the much requested green light to restart a high budget high stakes project from the ground up, I saw first hand how fear of the unknown could stop a great team of great engineers dead in their tracks. I will share my experiences of how admitting we didn't know freed us to try things without the fear of failure and, ultimately, delivered results we were all proud of."
