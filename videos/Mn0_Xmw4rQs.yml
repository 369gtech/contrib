description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2012\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nAdrian Cockcroft - Director of Architecture for the Cloud Systems Team at Netflix\n\nABSTRACT\nNetflix grew rapidly and moved its streaming video service to the AWS cloud between 2009 and 2010. In 2011 the architecture was extended to use Apache Cassandra as a backend, and the service was internationalized to support Latin America. Early in 2012 Netflix launched in the UK and Ireland, using the the combination of AWS capacity in Ireland and Cassandra to create a truly global backend service. Since then the code that manages and operates the global Netflix platform is being released as a series of open source projects at netflix.github.com (Asgard, Priam etc.). The platform is structured as a large scale PaaS, strongly leveraging advanced features of AWS to deploy many thousands of instances. The platform has primary language support for Java/Tomcat with most management tools built using Groovy/Grails and operations tooling in Python. Continuous integration and deployment tooling leverages Jenkins, Ivy/Gradle, Artifactory. This talk will explain how to build your own custom PaaS on AWS using these components.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
