description: "Recording brought to you by American Express. https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs\nGetting a multiplatform project started within an active engineering team across multiple platforms is challenging. You have to pitch the project to your colleagues, wrestle with reconciling platform-specific technical issues, and actually ship it for each supported platform.\n\nWe have spent the last year doing just that for PlanGrid and CashApp. Come learn how to get your multiplatform project started and what kinds of problems you can expect to solve along the way. We'll approach the problems from both the Android and iOS perspectives and arm you with the tools to make multiplatform not a multiproblem.\n\nResources:\nKotlinConf website: https://jb.gg/fyaze5\nKotlinConf on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlinconf\n\nKotlin website: https://jb.gg/pxrsn6\nKotlin blog: https://jb.gg/7uc7ow\nKotlin on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlin\n\n#KotlinConf19 #Kotlin #JetBrains\n\nAbout the Presenters:\nBen works on the PlanGrid iOS platform team and is a former CocoaPods core team member.\n\nAlec Strong - Android, Bass, Super Smash Bros Melee"
