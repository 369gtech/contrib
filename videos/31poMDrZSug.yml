description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io\_The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nSampling in the Observability Era - Steve Flanders, Splunk \n\nIn Cloud-Native environments, traditional monitoring techniques are not sufficient to understand system behavior and cannot effectively address availability as well as performance issues. This has led to the rise of observability and the importance of distributed tracing data which provides context and correlation missing from other data sources. Typically, distributed tracing data is sampled due to the amount of data it generates and concerns about whether all data generated is valuable. While sampling is often stated as a benign or normal thing, it can greatly impact observability. As a result, it is critical to understand what sampling is as well as how each sampling technique works and their associated tradeoffs. This talk will deep dive into what sampling is and at conventions as well as industry practices to address concerns including cost, performance, and overhead. \n\nhttps://sched.co/cp93"
