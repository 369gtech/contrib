title: '"What even is code? Building a non-code coding interface" - Katie Bell (LCA 2021 Online)'
recordingDate: 1612091482
description: "Katie Bell\n\nhttps://lca2021.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/45/\n\nI confess, I hate writing code in text files. I hate dealing with syntax errors, carefully matching brackets, style rules, line-by-line git diffs and tiny character-specific cursor movements. That's why I set out on an epic quest to build a coding interface with no bracket matching, no syntax errors and no whitespace â€” but it still has to be fast to edit, keyboard controlled and can't sprawl spaghetti lines across the screen.\r\n\r\nNot possible you say? Well you might be right, but I'm damn well going to try. Over the last year I've built a series of mocks and prototypes and every one of them has taught me something fascinating as I slowly grow closer to the goal. Join me on my exploration of what code even is and how human language influences how we think about code.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
