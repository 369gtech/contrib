description: "Cloud Security and how to leverage the shared responsibility model to your advantage - Eshrak Assaf & David Lebutsch, IBM\n\nAdopting Cloud Computing models could be a blessing or a curse. When done with security and compliance in mind, it could save you lots of time, effort and operational costs. When done without regard to security and compliance, it could result in exposing your company to financial and reputational risks. In this session, we will talk about some basic security and compliance concepts that developers need to know before they consider adopting Cloud Computing models. We will talk about how to leverage the Cloud shared responsibility model to your advantage, and why Cloud security and compliance is not optional."
