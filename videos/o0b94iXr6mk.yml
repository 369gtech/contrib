description: "Tim Perry is a technical lead and the open-source champion at Softwire, a bespoke software development company with offices in London, Bristol and Bucharest. He leads teams to build a variety of great software at every scale for Softwireâ€™s clients, and helps Softwire engage with and give back to the wider software development community.\n\nMicroservices and web components are two of the next Next Big Steps for modern software development, for the server and client side respectively. Although involving quite different new tools and techniques though, in reality both of these developments share a common development practices heritage, as extensions of the same forward trend of good software design principles.\n\nCheck out more about I T.A.K.E.
