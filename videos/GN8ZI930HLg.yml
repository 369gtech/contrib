description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Chicago 2019. #GOTOcon #GOTOchgo\nhttp://gotochgo.com\n\nGuen Prawiroatmodjo - Quantum Physicist Making Quantum Programming Possible\n\nABSTRACT\nA Quantum Computer is a new type of computer that uses quantum mechanics to run certain algorithms exponentially faster than their classical equivalents. These quantum algorithms typically use phenomena such as superposition, the ability for a quantum state to be two different values at once, and entanglement, or the ability for two quantum states to be inherently dependent on each other. Companies such as Google, IBM, Microsoft and start-ups such as Rigetti are investing heavily in this technology, and are deploying quantum processors in the cloud to use by the wider public.\nIn this talk, I will give an introduction to the syntax of quantum programming, and introduce several platforms and quantum programming libraries to help you get started writing your own quantum algorithms. Finally, I will go over [...]\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotochgo.com/2019/sessions/743\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOchgo\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttp://gotocon.com\n#QuantumComputing #QC #QuantumProgramming #QuantumAlgorithms"
