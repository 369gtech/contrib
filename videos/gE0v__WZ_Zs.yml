recordingDate: 1383891682
description: "Many startups follow these four basic rules:\n\n1. Go to Silicon Valley, to make connections.\n2. Offer a free version of your product, to get adoption.\n3. Get venture capital funding, so you can hire a great team.\n4. Offer your employees stock options early on, so they work harder.\n\nAtlassian did none of those things. Jay Simons, president of Atlassian, talks with Don Dodge and explains why and how some of these choices led to success.\n\nFor more Root Access episodes about startups, see the playlist: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOU2XLYxmsILjw2c4ImxWXvi4vPrLCjYv"
