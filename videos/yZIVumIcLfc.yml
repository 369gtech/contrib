title: 'DrupalCon Vienna 2017: How to Content Model in Drupal 8'
recordingDate: 1506422529
description: "This session is the third one in the series, following the Drupal 8 Hidden Power at DrupalCon Dublin 2016 and Drupal Architectures for Flexible Content at DrupalCon Barcelona 2015. But unlike the previous two, this time we will focus on practical application and demos, exclusively for Drupal 8.\n\nAtomic Design gives us a good vision on how to design the systems of components. But when it comes to the real project, things become more complicated and it can be really hard to implement.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause it covers the design patterns, not the content building blocks. These two things are closely interrelated but have completely different meaning: first is a view, second is a model. And don't worry: we are not going to re-implement the atom (wheel)!\n\nLet's try to create a big picture of content building process, review what we have in Drupal 8 and see how we can benefit from its core features keeping in mind Atomic Design principles.\n\nFinally we will stop talking and go through a nifty Drupal 8 setup giving you desired flexibility.\n\n\nThe following topics will be highlighted:\n\nHow to structure a page? In which independent components to split and how granularly?\nWhat is a difference between content items, building blocks and patterns/components?\nHow to re-use content throughout website? How to render the same content differently depending on the context?\nHow to organize the nesting of components?\nWhere is a border between content and layout?\nCan layout be treated as a content?\nWhy Paragraphs module doesn't work well in all cases?\nThe following modules will be covered:\n\nContent storage:\nNode\nCustom Block\nEntity Construction Kit\nParagraphs\nFields\nEntity Translation\nBuilding blocks:\nBlock Layout\nField Layout\nBricks\nView Modes\nEntity Reference\nEntity Reference Revisions\nDynamic Entity Reference\nLayout Discovery\nWebform\nViews\nContent editing:\nInline Entity Form\nEntity Browser\nEntity Reference Live Preview\nEntity Reference Integrity\nContextual Links\nQuick Edit\nPatterns and components:\nUI Patterns\nFractal\nPattern Lab\nIn this session I want to share a real experience when designing a content architecture of large multi-lingual and multi-layout websites for enterprise, academics and digital.\n\nThese very simple but extremely flexible techniques can be used for ANY Entity type and in almost ANY project. Re-understand your content today and create your own site buidling experience on top of Entity Reference, Layout API, Bricks and their wide contrib ecosystem!"
