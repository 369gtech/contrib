description: "# Crash, bang, wallop: miscellaneous lessons from exploring a drum kit\n\nJon Skeet - Google\n\n\"Last summer I bought an electronic drum kit. I’m thoroughly enjoying playing it (badly) but I’ve spent even more time talking to the kit over a USB MIDI connection, in an application which allows you to load, edit and save the drum kit configuration. Personal projects are always fertile grounds for learning and reflecting, unburdened by deadlines and other external forces.\n\nThis session will look at specific aspects of the (C#) code - particularly mutability and efficiency - but more importantly, we’ll reflect together on the nature of personal projects and how we can use them to become more effective in our professional coding lives.\"\n\n## About nor(DEV):con\n\nThe eastern region's biggest tech conference runs annually in February with a fantastic line-up of speakers and workshops. In our fifth year we joined 41 speakers, over 5 tracks, speaking on a wide range of subjects. Day 1 kicked off with technical deep dives into popular and important languages, frameworks and process. Our key theme for 2020 was wellbeing, with plenty of talks on the main stage around the subject on Day 2, alongside Workshops and plenty of tech talk too.\n\nYou can read more about the line up for 2020 at https://2020.nordevcon.com/ or watch 2021 shape up on our main site https://nordevcon.com/\n\n## About Norfolk Developers\n\nComplementing the existing tech community, Norfolk Developers will be peeling back the high level and going straight to the heart of software development practices and processes.
