title: 'DrupalCon Nashville 2018: Making Serverless Headless - Drupal with AWS'
recordingDate: 1525450817
description: "AWS Lambda@Edge allows you to run code closest to your end customers. In addition to being a serverless platform, it globally distributes your web-application to run out of dozens of AWS data centers across the planet, with your customers being served from the one nearest to them. Come join us for this session to learn how you can combine its forces -- with Drupal as powerful Headless CMS, Lambda@Edge running Javascript frontend framework (like Angular, Ember and React), and CloudFront as Content Delivery Network with built in DDoS protection.\n\nA seamless integration between Drupal, Lambda@Edge and CloudFront, delivers lowest latency and personalized experience to your end customers, where ever they are on the planet. Offering ease-of-maintenance, out-of-the-box DDoS protection, and scale.\n\nIn this session, we will look at architecture, integration examples, and best practices for some of the most popular use-cases from across different channels – web, mobile, social media, chatbots, wearables, VR/AR, etc. Experience with AWS Lambda, AWS Lambda@Edge, Amazon CloudFront and Drupal would be valuable, but not necessary to attend this session.\n\nRelated:\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/lambda/edge/\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/\nhttps://www.drupal.org/"
