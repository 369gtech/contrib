description: "This talk took place at CukenFest London 2019, our annual conference for BDD enthusiasts. More info here - http://cukenfest.cucumber.io\n\nMost teams would agree that examples are a great way for teams to gain a better understanding of the problem they are trying to solve. The challenge, however, is getting teams to engage in productive conversations that result in realistic, concrete examples that go beyond the happy path. In this session, I'll talk about the techniques I've used to while example mapping to engage teams and unearth the valuable examples that have helped us significantly reduce our number of \"Oh Crap\" moments during and after development.\n\nRobert Meaney (@RobMeaney)\n\nRob's slides will be available at https://speakerdeck.com/cucumberbdd"
