description: "Traditional time series analysis techniques have found success in a variety of data mining tasks. However, they often require years of experience to master and the recent development of straightforward, easy-to-use analysis tools has been lacking. STUMPY is a scientific Python library for modern time series analysis that efficiently computes something called a matrix profile and leverages popular open source software and enables you to do better science!\n\nhttps://github.com/TDAmeritrade/stumpy​\nhttps://stumpy.readthedocs.io​\n\nSean Law is a senior applied scientific researcher and lead data scientist currently working with a multi-talented Exploration Lab team and serves as an advisor on an enterprise A.I.
