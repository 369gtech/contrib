description: "Presented by David Guttman, JSLA/SPEC.LA Organizer at JSLA (js.la) Thursday September 26th, 2013 - Holy crap streams are awesome.

If you've never coded with streams before, or are interested in taking your game to the next level, you don't want to miss this talk.\n\ntwitter.com/davidguttman\ngithub.com/davidguttman"
