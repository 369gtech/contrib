description: "\"Something Old, Something Gnu, Something Bogus, Something Blew\"\n\nHow can they do it? How can Josh Bloch and Bob Lee keep coming up with such great programming puzzlers year after year? They can't! In this, the umpteenth installment of this perennial crowd pleaser, Click and Hack the Type-It brothers recycle the best of a bad lot, and throw in a few all-new puzzles for your pleasure and astonishment. But it's not all fun and games: the lessons you take away from this fun-filled extravaganza will alert you to the dangers that lurk in Java's dark corners, so you can avoid or eliminate them from your programs and designs. Come early—as always, overripe fruit will be given to the first fifty attendees.\n\nBob Lee\nSquare\n@crazybob\n\nJoshua Bloch consults for Square.
