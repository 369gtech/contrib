title: 'Create Drive Time Areas and Perform Drive Time Distance Analysis'
language: English
recordingDate: 1603306267
description: "Want to find the nearest pizza place, check if all homes in the city can be reached by fire stations within 10 minutes, or understand the market areas covered by store locations? Drive time/drive distance analysis can answer these and many more business planning questions. For example, defining a trade area requires accurate estimations of travel time and distance of customers to-and-from business location(s).\n\nIn this session, you'll learn how to conduct large-scale drive distance/drive time analysis using the Network Data Model (NDM), a part of Oracle Database spatial features. We'll show how to generate network buffers from NDM data models and how to perform queries on them. We'll discuss some use cases of network buffers on trade area analysis and geofencing.   We'll also talk about finding the nearest point of interest (a restaurant, a convenience store, or a gas station)  in a location-based service and discuss vehicle deviation detection in fleet management to ensure a driver follows a planned route."
