description: "Touch screens, physical sensors and hardware miniaturization have greatly enhanced the personal connection between ourselves and our digital devices. Mapping physical input to UI/UX, operating systems now simulate natural systems. We swipe, shake, push and pinch as willing participants in a simulation meant to mirror our physical world.\n\nIn this talk, we'll examine in detail the special qualities of natural looking motion and how a simple combination of forces can lure our perception. We'll focus specifically on natural coding in a web browser and how we can overcome the challenges browsers present. Finally, we'll look at how applying a natural coding approach to prototyping can expand the creative possibilities of the products we create on both desktop and mobile platforms.\n\nSource: http://2013.jsconf.eu/speakers/vince-allen-creating-natural-simulations-in-a-web-browser.html\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
