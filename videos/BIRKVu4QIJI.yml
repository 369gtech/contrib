title: 'Reactive hardcore: how to implement own Publisher (Oleh Dokuka)'
recordingDate: 1547650983
description: "The more popular Reactive Programming/Libraries become, the more often we have to deal with those techniques and solutions. Sometimes we have to deal just with smoothies API of Reactive Extensions, sometimes we have to dive into the internals of those libraries, or sometimes we have to build our own implementation. Nevertheless, understanding of the basics patterns, behavior that is hidden inside the most of Reactive Libraries, Tool-Kits / Best Practice might simplify our â€“ life with / debugging of / implementation of Reactive Library.\nUsually reading a tone of papers and blogs about the internals of Reactive Libraries, specific rules of Reactive Streams Specification or simply grasping the source code becomes hardcore. Hence, we will summarize all important by implementing own Publisher using Java."
