description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nSponsored Session: Elastic - Elastic and Kubernetes: From Orchestration to Observability  \n\nJoin Elastic for our virtual demo session, get access to custom content, grab exclusive virtual swag, and chat with real people.  In this video, we’ll give a quick introduction to Elasticsearch (the free and open, scalable, and highly-available search engine and datastore) and how it powers use cases like Enterprise Search, Observability, and Security.    We’ll demonstrate how the applications that power Elastic Observability (Logs, Metrics, APM, and Uptime) consolidate the event streams from your Kubernetes, cloud and physical infrastructure, Prometheus, and other CNCF projects and services with your application traces in a fast, scalable, and unified data store.   Learn how to spin up an Elastic Stack cluster with Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes (ECK), the official operator for orchestrating Elasticsearch on Kubernetes for day one, day two, and beyond. \n\nhttps://sched.co/fezx"
