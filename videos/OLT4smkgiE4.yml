title: 'Fly like a rocket with Helidon by Dmitry Aleksandrov'
recordingDate: 1621186930
description: "Good news, everyone! Helidon got a jet engine! Now Helidon is packed with modern, high-tech, James Bond-level features and it flies like a rocket! Also, thanks to a nicely crafted fitness plan, the weight has been reduced and concentration increased - resulting in less RAM consumption and faster waking. Come to my live coding session to learn about all of the new features added in Helidon 2.1; such as GraalVM native image support in Helidon MP, MicroProfile Reactive Streams and Reactive Stream Operators, Helidon DB Client and HTTP Client in Helidon SE. I will also be demonstrating the new command line tool and live-reloading feature which will nitro-boost your development process.\n\nDmitry Aleksandrov, Oracle\n\nPresented at Jfokus conference 9th February 2021.\nhttps://www.jfokus.se"
