description: "GoWayFest 4.0, Online – July 11-12, 2020\n\nWriting idiomatic Go using Domain Driven Design, Damiano Petrungaro\n\nThere are plenty of articles explaining how to apply DDD in Go, but none of them uses the language idiomatically. What if I tell you that it is possible to achieve it without ending up with an OOP application?\nLet’s create a Go app modeling a domain from the strategic as well as the tactical side. How many times have you read an article about DDD and Go ending up using DTOs and DAOs or packages named infrastructure, application, and domain?\nThis talk is not going to be about reuse the concepts from the DDD literature applied in other idioms, ending up with an object-oriented application written in Go. Instead, I’ll show how to apply the most popular tactical patterns to shape as idiomatic Go code the domain invariants, and how to use strategic patterns to let a domain analysis structure an application.\n\nSlides – https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U6MCLIcawszPdXBe6H_2fWsfNHILufiT/view?usp=sharing"
