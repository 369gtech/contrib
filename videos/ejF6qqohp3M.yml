description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nDiscussion & Comments: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2019\n—\nComputer scientists are bad at relationships. Nearly every program crash is rooted in a mismanaged relationship, yet we spend most of our time discussing types and functions and not the relationships connecting them together. This talk looks at common ways data and code are connected in an application, how those relationships are typically represented, and the problems caused by the use, and misuse of these paradigms. Then we'll look at ways to model these relationships in C++ and use them to build correct applications.\n— \nSean Parent\nAdobe / Photoshop\nSr. Principal Scientist\nSan Jose, CA\n\nSean Parent is a principal scientist and software architect for Adobe’s digital imaging group.
