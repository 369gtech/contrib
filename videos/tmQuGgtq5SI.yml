title: 'CSSconf EU 2018 | Oliver Williams: Refactoring with CSS Grid'
language: English
recordingDate: 1531123730
description: "Is CSS grid ready for production? Find out from somebody who’s used grid on a large site – all while supporting Internet Explorer. I’ll discuss what I’ve already refactored with grid and what I plan to refactor once forthcoming features (display:contents and subgrid) are more widely implemented by browsers. I’ll show how I handled Internet Explorer and older browsers using @supports and simple fallback layouts. After working on a site that used javascript and backend logic together with floats to implement layouts, I’ll explain how I managed to refactor to use a pure CSS only approach thanks to grid. Working with grid also offers the perfect opportunity to start using CSS custom properties – because all browsers that support CSS grid also support custom properties.\n\nCSSconf EU will be back on May 31st 2019: https://2019.cssconf.eu/"
