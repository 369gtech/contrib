description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nRoll Out the Red Carpet for Production Kubernetes Clusters with a Kube-vip - Dan Finneran, Equinix\n\nThis talk begins with the presenter trying to improve upon a problem, namely deploying Kubernetes clusters on bare-metal and taking them into production. Often tasked by customers of making their on-premises clusters as \"public cloud like\" as possible, a lot of work went into writing solutions for these functionality gaps. Time and time again ensuring highly available access to clusters proved problematic to implement and implement into lifecycle patterns. Kube-vip slowly evolved from trying to fix that one use case into a widely used project that provides highly available Kubernetes clusters for various infrastructures. This talk will cover that journey, and show how from on-prem to the edge you can implement both highly available networking and extend that same functionality to \"inside\" the cluster with load balancer functionality for Kubernetes services with Kube-Vip."
