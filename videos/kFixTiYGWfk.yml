description: "\"Running a Synchrotron on Open Source Python\n[EuroPython 2019 - Talk - 2019-07-12 - MongoDB]\n[Basel, CH]\n\nBy Clinton Roy\n\nA synchrotron is a large research facility that has a large software stack to keep things running, fortunately a large chunk of the stack is Open Source and fair chunk of it is Python to boot. By the end of the talk attendees will understand the scale of the infrastructure (both physical and software) that is required, and have an idea of what sort of problems a synchrotron could help them solve.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2019.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/"
