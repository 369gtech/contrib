description: "Change music in two epochs\n[EuroPython 2018 - Talk - 2018-07-27 - Fintry [PyData]]\n[Edinburgh, UK]\n\nBy Marcel Raas\n\nThis talk is about applying deep learning to music. We will look at the raw music data and discover the following:\n\n\nHow to detect instruments from a piece of music\nHow to detect what is being played by what instrument\nHow to isolate instruments in multi-instrument (polyphonic) music\n\n\nInstead of applying it to existing music we will generate our own music using some simple musical rules. The benefit of this is that we are in control of the complexity and we know exactly what is being played. We start out simple and then start adding more instruments, different timbres, etc. As we go up in complexity, we shall see how to adapt our models to be able to deal with it. This gives interesting insights in what structures in deep nets work well.\n\nI will show:\n\n\nHow to build a simple synthesizer using numpy\nHow to create an unlimited data set of improvisation that sounds musical\nHow to use this data set for detecting instruments using deep learning\nHow to filter out one instrument when multiple synthesizers are playing at once\n\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2018.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
