description: "The Java Native Interface (JNI) is the standard interface that enables developers to integrate Java with native (machine-dependent) code written in other programming languages such as C/C++. JNI can, on the one hand, help couple native resources to a Java application, but if implemented natively, on the other hand, it can lead to stability and security problems such as integer overflows. Although it is relatively easy to find and apply recommendations for secure coding of Java applications, developers who need to write native code are typically left to generic recommendations for the native language they use. The goal of this session is to fill this gap and provide a working knowledge of writing secure native code on multiple platforms.\n\n\nAuthor:\nMarc Schönefeld\nMarc is working within the Java Security community\nsince 2002, first as part of  this PhD thesis research, and later\n(2007-2011) as member of the Red Hat Security Response Team. \nIn 2011 he joined Oracle's Java Vulnerability team. \n\nView more trainings by Marc Schönefeld at https://www.parleys.com/author/marc-schonefeld-1\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
