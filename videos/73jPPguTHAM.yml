title: 'DrupalCon Baltimore 2017: Artificial Intelligence Gives Your Site Superpowers'
recordingDate: 1493183040
description: "Drupal's core feature as a CMS\_is the collection and organization of content.\_It's been said that Data is the \"fuel\" for the latest machine learning (ML) techniques called \"Deep Learning\" and \"Neural Networks\".\_It turns out that Drupal's structured content is exactly the type of fuel these techniques need to\_learn useful patterns and provide state of the art functionality that wasn't even possible 5 years ago.\n\nThe audience for this talk should be interested in machine learning and it's applications, but no coding background is necessary. \_You will learn how to look at your data from the perspective of an ML engineer.\_You will also\_discover\_how you can leverage Deep Learning\_and your own site\_content to give Drupal superpowers by using the same technology that's exploding at Facebook, Google, and Amazon.\n\nWe will cover:\n\nWhat is Deep Learning?\nWhat types of problems is Deep Learning good at and how reliable is it?\nHow to mine your Drupal content as the fuel for Deep Learning.\nWhen should you use existing ML models or services and when should you create your own?\nHow do you deploy these ML models and use them in production?\nAlternatives to training your own.\_Writing your own classifier isn't that hard, but it can be prohibitive for those without an ML background or compute resources. Luckily, there are solutions for implementing existing ML applications to analyze your site's data, even if you don't have any ML experience.\_We will demonstate some alternatives using free pre-built models and\_paid\_services from Amazon, IBM, Microsoft, Google, and others.\nUse a Drag and Drop interface to create, train, and deploy a simple\_ML model\_to the cloud using the\_Microsoft Azure ML API\nUse\_Google Speech API\_to turn spoken audio into text for use with chatbots and virtual assitants.\nSentiment Analysis (i.e. are reviews positive or negative) using the Watson REST API\nUploaded images can add Face, Logo, and Object detection using the Google Vision API module\nAutomatically creating summaries from node content using Microsoft's ML API"
