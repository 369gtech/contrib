On the 10th commit, the feature is live and users are giving feedback. On the 100th commit, users are delighted to be using the application. But on the 1000th commit, users are unhappy with the responsiveness of the application and the developers are struggling to move at the velocity they once were. Does this sound familiar?\n\nWe will go over some of the pieces of technical debt that can accumulate and can cause application performance and development velocity issues, and the strategies Clio uses to keep these kinds of technical debt under control."
