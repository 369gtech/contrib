Between DNS, network complexity, infrastructure like home servers and CDNs, and bandwidth capacity, there is so much to keep track of – and much of it is outside of your own control.\n\nSo what can DevOps do to ensure that their sites are running as fast and reliably as possible?\n\nMehdi Daoudi, CEO and Co-founder of Catchpoint Systems, will draw upon his years of experience in the monitoring industry to highlight the many different factors that can cause a site to fail, and the best practices for avoiding them. He’ll highlight how success is about more than just preparation, it’s learning from the inevitable failures that you encounter along the way.\n\nYou may not be able to tame the beast completely, but you can certainly learn to avoid some of its more dangerous movements, and recover as quickly as possible from those that you can’t.\n\nThis keynote is sponsored by Catchpoint Systems.\n\nAbout Mehdi Daoudi (Catchpoint Systems):\nMehdi is the founder and CEO of Catchpoint, the fastest-growing Web Performance Monitoring Solution.
