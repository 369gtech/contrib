description: "Jaren Glover, Robinhood\n\nThis is a story about what happens when a distributed system becomes a big part of a small team's infrastructure.

This presentation will be a tactical approach to conquering a complex system with an understaffed team while your business is growing fast.\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
