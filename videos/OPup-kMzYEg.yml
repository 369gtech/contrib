description: "In major cases I saw development teams that are geographically separated from the product management. In some other cases there were native teams were seating close to the product people, whereas the unlucky ones were spread across the globe.\r\nI've seen both successful and disastrous projects in terms of the ways communication and coordination was designed. I saw people being pretty much on the same page in terms of project goals while seating in different offices and in different countries. And I saw people being completely off the track, suffering and losing motivation.\r\nFor the last five years I've been collecting mental memories of what made some projects good places to be and some not-so-good ones.\r\nNow with a ever-growing market of offshore development in the Eastern Europe, I see a need to integrate what I've seen and try to make it beneficial for the industry. To let people know how to do it properly to avoid the aches."
