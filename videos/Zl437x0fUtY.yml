title: 'Creating An Incremental Architecture For Your System  What, Why and How (Giovanni Asproni, UK)'
recordingDate: 1486916531
description: "Experience taught us that creating an architecture for a system with a big design upfront is a bad idea as, usually, we don’t have all the necessary information to design the system at the very start - even in moderate sized systems requirements tend to change significantly, often making the initial design unfit for purpose.\n\nOn the other hand, no upfront design can be just as bad - the code tends to become unmaintainable pretty quickly, and system qualities like performances, scalability, security, latency, etc., can be very difficult, if not impossible, to retrofit.\n\nIn this talk I’ll show a different way to create a software architecture with just the right amount of design that can be incrementally evolved (or changed) as the system grows and changes - by taking care of some important qualities of the system early in the design, and delaying the design of other aspects to the last responsible moment."
