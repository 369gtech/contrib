description: "Speaker: Tim Riley, Partner and Developer, Icelab\n\nWe build our Ruby apps with the best of intentions, but it's all too easy for them to become tangled and hard to maintain. If you've reached for object-oriented design principles as your path forward, and found them elusive or hard to apply, there is still hope! It turns out that some of our best OO code may live behind an FP curtain. Come along and discover how a functional architecture can make your Ruby apps not only SOLID, but a real joy to build, test, and extend.\n\nSpeaker's Bio\n\nTim Riley is a partner at Australian design agency Icelab, and a core developer of dry-rb. He's excited by small libraries, first-class functions, and pushing forward web app development with Ruby.\n\nEvent Page: http://www.reddotrubyconf.com/\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/8HYV/"
