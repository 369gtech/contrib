description: "This video will get you up and running with your first game AI in just 10 lines of Python. The AI can theoretically learn to master any game you train it on, but has only been tested on 2D Atari games so far. \n\nThe code for this video is here:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/Game-AI\n\nI created a Slack channel for us, sign up here:\nhttps://wizards.herokuapp.com/\n\nTensorflow install instructions here:\nhttps://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.8/get_started/os_setup.html#pip-installation\n\nGym install instructions here:\nhttps://gym.openai.com/docs\n\nGreat course on the brain (I really love this course):\nhttps://www.mcb80x.org/\n\nOriginal Deep Q Learner Paper:\nhttps://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vmnih/docs/dqn.pdf\n\nLots of info on convolutional neural networks:\nhttp://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/\n\nLots of info on reinforcement learning:\nhttp://www.nervanasys.com/demystifying-deep-reinforcement-learning/\n\nI'm a fan of www.fomoro.com for cloud GPU computing since they are the only free-to-try cloud GPU provider I could find. Let me know if you find another!\n\nI love you guys! Thanks for watching my videos, I do it for you. I left my awesome job at Twilio and I'm doing this full time now. \n\nI recently created a Patreon page. If you like my videos, feel free to help support my effort here!:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/user?ty=h&u=3191693\n\nMuch more to come so please subscribe, like, and comment.\nFollow me:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/sirajraval\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/sirajology Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/sirajraval/ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/sirajraval/"
