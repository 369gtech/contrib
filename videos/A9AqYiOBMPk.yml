description: "See how reality is hacked.\nA surprising number of things work invisibly, whether they be wifi, radio, government decent, or games. This session is meant to via the process of reverse engineering to show some of the creative thinking that goes on in the world around us. \nSoftware engineers have long been the implementers or users of these tools and forces, yet many are unaware of what their code ends up doing.\n\nI plan to show real examples\nof how success, like bactiria, have been cultured. How cultural understandings can be shortcuts to success in the hopes to bring greater awareness of how these systems work.\n\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry in the Malmö/Lund region. Foo Café is aimed at those interested in sharing, learning and creating. \nJoin the fun at foocafe.org"
