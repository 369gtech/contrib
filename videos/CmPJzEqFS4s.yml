It aims to help you \"stay in the flow\", to automatically do as much as possible while also staying out of your way. To learn how to make the most of this, sometimes we need to see how others use the tool to understand what is possible and how it helps.\n\nIn this session, Trisha will demonstrate how key features of IntelliJ IDEA help you to develop code more effectively. We'll look at some simple navigation tricks to help us to get around the IDE faster; we'll use code generation and live templates to create code more easily; we'll see how inspections and intentions, refactoring and code analysis can help to improve the code we've written; and we'll step through some testing and debugging scenarios to understand how these tools help us to create quality code."
