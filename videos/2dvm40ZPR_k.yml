title: 'No Docs? No Problem! From Zero to Full Documentation in Less Time than You Think'
recordingDate: 1579223050
description: "Nathan Willis\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/85/\n\nThis session is a guide to developing and deploying technical documentation for a mature codebase in minimal time. It details practical advice and lessons learned from the speaker's personal experience taking the HarfBuzz library from a starting point with virtually no documentation to a full-fledged set of internal and external references, plus code-integration and end-user guides.\r\n\r\nThe topics covered will include designing documentation from the top down as an \"alternative API\" to the code itself, strategies for staging a large documentation project is discrete parts that can be deployed successively, building documentation in a continuous-integration environment, and practical tips for documentation teams.\r\n\r\nThe presentation will also showcase the benefits of rolling out documentation in parallel to development, including insights on system architecture and improved community involvement.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
