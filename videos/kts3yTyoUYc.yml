description: "RustConf 2019 - Messing Around with FN Main() and Getting Away with it by Yoshua Wuyts\n\nThe introduction of return types in main has made writing binaries a lot nicer. But why stop there? What if we could make main an async fn to support top-level await? Or perhaps allow main to take command line arguments as parameters?\n\nIn this talk I’ll show how to make fn main perform party tricks, make boilerplate disappear, and saw code size in half. And by the end of the show you’ll have a good picture to take home of what Rust might look like in the future."
