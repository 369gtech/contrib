description: "VanillaStack, an open-source Kubernetes-based cloud-stack, introduces a new approach to set-up and distribute open-source cloud-workloads, abstracting from complexities and providing the foundation for an open-source ecosystem, which is truly open and vendor-agnostic.\n\nIn this webinar, the open-source edition of VanillaStack and the underlying ideas are introduced, the idea behind the platform is explained and the future roadmap for integration and roll-out of open-source projects is laid out.\n\nSince VanillaStack will be donated to the community, this webinar will function as an igniter and as a door-opener for all the projects being possibly interested in joining the platform.\n\nPresenter:\n\nKarsten Samaschke, CEO @Cloudical"
