They have features, idioms, and community standards that drive us towards certain ways of doing things. Erlang is over 30 years old and has a very mature way of doing things. Elixir came on the scene, bringing with it some new ideas from other ecosystems. We're seeing even more of this with BEAM languages from LFE to Alpaca to Erlog.\n\nIdeas come in and out of fashion. Some of them are lost and aren't given a chance again. But as technology continues to evolve, perhaps there's space for what's old to be made new again! This talk will explore a few ideas lost to time that perhaps have their chance to shine again. It asks what languages would look like if history had gone slightly differently, and what depths we can plumb for the next 30 years and 50 languages on the BEAM.\n\nSlides & full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/brooklyn-zelenka/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - BROOKLYN ZELENKA\nPrograms with functions Î»\n\nBrooklyn is the co-founder and chief scientist at FISSION, where her team is building the next generation of web dev tools, levelling the playing field for teams of all sizes.\nShe is an Ethereum core developer, founded the Vancouver functional programming meetup, and is the author of several Elixir libraries including Exceptional, Quark, Algae, and Witchcraft.
