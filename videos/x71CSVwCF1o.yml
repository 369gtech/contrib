description: "ConstraintLayout is a new layout for Android platform.Seems to be similar to RelativeLayout but has more cool features and some say that also better performance. \nIn my presentation I want to show how UI layouts used to be done on Android and what ConstraintLayout, a new kind on the block, brings to table to help build a responsive UI for Android.We will also dig deep into ConstraintLayout itself to see how it actually works."
