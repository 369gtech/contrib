description: "After building a startup, Samebug, for 5 years it was a hard decision to sell it. Even though there is a lot of literature on how to make an acquisition work, it will always come down to the attitude of the parties involved.\n\nWe have come a long way over the past 6 months of integrating into the buyer organisation, Rollbar. We had to prove ourselves to the whole company and had various arguments along the way.\n\nSince Rollbar is in San Francisco, USA and we are in Budapest, Hungary, we also had to overcome the difficulties of location and time zone difference.\n\nThe journey has been full of ups and downs so far and there is still a lot more to come. Come join the session if you are thinking of selling your startup or if you are just interested in what problems can arise and how to overcome them.\n\nRenata Tamasi is the Director of Corporate Development at Rollbar. She is responsible for company-wide strategic projects and her first, main project is creating the Customer Success function.\n\nBefore joining Rollbar, she was the CEO and co-founder of Samebug, a venture-backed startup. She has built a world-wide network of advisors and entrepreneurs to support her venture. Selling her company to Rollbar Inc., (https://rollbar.com/media/pr/rollbar-acquires-samebug/) a San Francisco based company, was a strategic move to realize the vision she and her co-founders had: to change how developers debug software.\n\nShe has over 10 years of experience in technology and insurance. Renata holds an MBA from CEU Business School and as a formal Toastmaster Club member, she earned the 'Competent Communicator' title.\n\nShe is an avid reader. Renata lives in Budapest, Hungary with her husband and their three energetic children."
