recordingDate: 1472140971
description: 'On December 2015, during an internal Wix Hackathon, we decided to rewrite our aging Micro-services infrastructure. This is our story. In this story, we will see how to build a modern infrastructure that enables you to deploy a self-servicing grid of computers on which micro-services can run and discover one another. Most Micro-services talk discuss culture, or technology, or motivations. I will be showing how to build one using off the shelf components like Mesos and nginx.'
