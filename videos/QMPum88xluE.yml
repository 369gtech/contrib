language: English
recordingDate: 1474122894
description: "Enforcing the myriad of policies surrounding security, availability, cost, and other business requirements of new services in a distributed operating environment is not for the faint of heart.\n\nIn this talk, Susan will demonstrate how to write a type provider in Idris which will read in VPC and subnet resource metadata from AWS and build a small library of functions that can enforce security, and availability policies for distributed systems deployments."
