You might be thinking that you cannot hack assistants because you can't say \"What's the weather in Boston' or 1=1--\" or your assistant is safe in your house.  Unfortunately, there are ways around both.  This talk helps you understand how assistant applications are attacked, work, and how to identify and address vulnerabilities in them.\n\nAbraham Kang\nSenior Director Software, Samsung Research America\nAbraham Kang is fascinated with the nuanced details associated with programming languages and their associated APIs.
