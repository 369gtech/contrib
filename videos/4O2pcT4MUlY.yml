description: "Full title: Community Driven Development: Sustainable Open Source for Social Justice\n\nPresented at Abstractions II, a software conference Code & Supply in Pittsburgh, PA August 21-23, 2019. Learn more at http://www.codeandsupply.co or https://abstractions.io. \n\nThe RAW CUTS series is comprised of selections from a few of our stages wherein the raw video was of high enough quality for C&S to release it before post-production. \n\nPost-production for a community-run conference with as many speakers and as low of a budget as Abstractions is an enormous and time-consuming undertaking. If you're interested in volunteering your time and CPU cycles to help with post-production, we can use your help. Email us at support@codeandsupply.co and we'll get you into the mix. You'll be permitted to credit yourself in the video pre-roll and credits and we'll thank you in this text and on social media.\n\nInterested in sponsoring professional post-production costs in exchange for your company's name and logo in the video forevermore? Contact us at sponsorship@abstractions.io. Opportunities start at $1,000.\n\n-----\n\nAs developers who want to lend our skills to support organizations fighting for social justice, how do we build effective, impactful collaborations with organizations and make the resulting open source projects sustainable? Over two years and 978 commits, we’ll follow the evolution of an open source project built with and for New Sanctuary Coalition, an NYC immigrant rights organization, to help them meet exponentially growing demand for their services following the 2016 election.\n\nWe’ll examine how having technologists embedded in NSC facilitated the initial application build out through first-hand knowledge of the work the software is supporting, motivation of working alongside a community, and mutual trust with leadership. Through lessons learned in maintaining open source and reflection on how NSC builds community, we’ll talk about the strategies we implemented to recruit and onboard contributors, keep contributors motivated and engaged, and make contributors part of the larger NSC community.\n\nhttps://abstractions.io/schedule/#Community%20Driven%20Development:%20Sustainable%20Open%20Source%20for%20Social%20Justice-Christine%20Zagrobelny"
