description: "Presented at Abstractions II, a software conference Code & Supply in Pittsburgh, PA August 21-23, 2019. Learn more at http://www.codeandsupply.co or https://abstractions.io. \n\nThe RAW CUTS series is comprised of selections from a few of our stages wherein the raw video was of high enough quality for C&S to release it before post-production. \n\nPost-production for a community-run conference with as many speakers and as low of a budget as Abstractions is an enormous and time-consuming undertaking. If you're interested in volunteering your time and CPU cycles to help with post-production, we can use your help. Email us at support@codeandsupply.co and we'll get you into the mix. You'll be permitted to credit yourself in the video pre-roll and credits and we'll thank you in this text and on social media.\n\nInterested in sponsoring professional post-production costs in exchange for your company's name and logo in the video forevermore? Contact us at sponsorship@abstractions.io. Opportunities start at $1,000.\n\n-----\n\nAt the company I work for, everything we build is distributed; our software and our company itself; my team alone is in 12 timezones. Building distributed systems is notoriously hard, but as they say, “humans are even more difficult.” As we’ve worked to build a purposely distributed team, we’ve faced specific challenges and worked to overcome them directly. We’ve treated our distributed nature as a boon to who we are and how we work, not just a challenging fact of life to be overcome, or a bug to be dealt with.\n\nThis talk dives into the details of how our company thrives on its distributed model:\n\n* Why we say \"distributed\" instead of \"remote\" and how that language has been key from day one.\n\n* How have shared values held us together as a group and how have they evolved as we scale from a handful to over 1000 employees?\n\n* What challenges we face on a daily basis being distributed\n\n* What tools and practices we use to over come them\n\n* How we can possibly make it work with a truly global team.\n\nhttps://abstractions.io/schedule/#Distributed%20by%20Design%20-or-%20How%20to%20Work%20with%20a%20Team%20in%2012%20Timezones-Aaron%20Aldrich"
