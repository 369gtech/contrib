description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2012\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nSean Treadway - Engineer at SoundCloud\n\nABSTRACT\nCassandra's storage models has both strengths and weaknesses. We'll discuss how SoundCloud takes advantage of the strengths of Cassandra's Memtable/SSTable storage layer as the backend for our activity stream and how understanding what your database does on disk is as important as understanding the data model you're persisting.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
