description: "It all seemed so simple at first - hook up automatic deployments to our source control repository and every push goes straight to production. That worked fantastic until we introduced complications into the mix - the database! How can we safely and effectively make changes to databases - without taking the whole system down!\n\nIn this talk we'll look at the common problems faced with making database changes. We'll cover the major tools used to address database changes, and the advantages and disadvantages to each. Next, we'll see how database migrations can effectively address schema changes over time, for both SQL and NoSQL databases. Finally, we'll look at solutions for some real-world scenarios when we apply migrations at scale.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks, courses, and conferences in the following links:\nhttps://ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
