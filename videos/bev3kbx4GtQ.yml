title: '[VDM19] Serverless with Knative by Mete Atamel'
language: English
recordingDate: 1557994918
description: 'When you build a serverless app, you either tie yourself to a cloud provider, or you end up building your own serverless stack. Knative provides a better choice. Knative extends Kubernetes to provide a set of middleware components (build, serving, events) for modern, source-centric, and container-based apps that can run anywhere. In this talk, weâ€™ll see how we can use Knative primitives to build a serverless app that utilizes the Machine Learning magic of the cloud.'
