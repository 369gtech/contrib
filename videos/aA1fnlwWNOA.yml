title: 'Kevin Whinnery | Ending the Web Versus Native Debate | Mobilism 2012'

description: "The \"web versus native\" debate is raging among mobile developers. Build native? You're locking yourself into a (usually closed and proprietary) platform and duplicating effort. Build for the web? You're sacrificing performance and features that benefit users. Like most divisive debates, there's a lot of truth on both sides.\n\nTitanium Mobile is set on squashing this debate by providing developers an open source, extensible platform for building real native apps and rich web apps with a unified JavaScript API.\n\nIn this presentation, we will dissect the \"web versus native\" problem, and see how Titanium is solving cross-platform in a way that sidesteps the underlying issues in this debate. We'll also check out a real, multi-platform Titanium codebase, and learn how to target multiple platforms without falling into the common trap of \"write once, suck everywhere\". Prior JavaScript knowledge is very helpful to understand the code walkthroughs, but not strictly necessary.\n\nAbout Kevin: https://twitter.com/kevinwhinnery\nAbout Mobilism: https://mobilism.nl"
