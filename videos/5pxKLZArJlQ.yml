title: 'YOW! Data 2017 Mick Semb Wever - The Network, The Kingmaker: Distributed Tracing and Zipkin'
recordingDate: 1508799600
description: "Adding Zipkin instrumentation into a codebase makes it possible to create one tracing view across an entire platform. This is the often eluded \"correlation identifier\" that's recommended by Microservices but has so few solid open sourced solutions available. This is an aspect to monitoring of distributed platforms akin to the separate concerns in aggregation of metrics and logs.\nThis talk will use the use case of extending Apache Cassandra's tracing: to use Zipkin so to demonstrate a single tracing view across an entire system. From browser and HTTP, through a distributed platform, and into the Database down to seeks on disk. Put together it makes easy to identify which queries to a particular service took the longest and to trace back how the application made them.\nThis presentation will raise the requirements and expectations DevOps has on their infrastructural tools. For people that want to take their infrastructural tools to the next level, where the network is known as the kingmaker.\n\nMick Semb Wever works at The Last Pickle, helping customers around the world deliver and improve Apache Cassandra based solutions. With 19 years software engineering behind him, from robotic kinematics, reverse modelling in geo sciences, computer graphics languages, federated search engines, to at-scale event-driven designs, Mick has done his time in the trenches. And is now an advocate for change towards Microservices that are built upon modern data-driven practices introducing eventually-consistent highly-available solutions reliant upon Apache technologies like Cassandra, Hadoop, Spark, and Kafka.\nHe's always had a keen involvement in open source code, contributing to codebases along the way, and now relishes opportunities to speak at conferences and meetups, like JavaZone and the Cassandra Summit, where ever he travels. He is an Apache Member, an Apache Cassandra committer, the PMC Chair for Apache Tiles, as well as being a DataStax MVP for Apache Cassandra since 2014.\n\nFor more information on YOW!
