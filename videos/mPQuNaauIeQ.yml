recordingDate: 1433784723
description: "Building a machine-to-machine (M2M) solution usually involves development of a messaging protocol, a cloud server, and a lot of design and development on the communication side, which is not as exciting as building the actual project. This presentation uses Java ME and an open source framework that does just that: connects devices and applications to the cloud, giving you the foundation to develop the actual functionality. The session discusses what it takes to build an M2M application from the architect’s and developer’s standpoint and presents a demo that goes through the stages of making your Java ME M2M application connected.\n\n\nAuthor:\nArtem Astafurov\nInnovator with computer science background and years of experience in custom software development industry.
