description: "This presentation is about a new platform for server-side JavaScript applications on the Java Virtual Machine, using the node programming model, APIs, and the module ecosystem. These Java/JavaScript hybrid applications can leverage capabilities of both environments—accessing the latest node frameworks while taking advantage of the Java platform’s scalability, manageability, tools, and extensive collection of Java libraries and middleware. In this session, you will learn how to write hybrid applications that take advantage of both ecosystems. You will also see a demonstration of one such JavaScript application that enables images to be uploaded to a database from a Web client, using a combination of some popular node frameworks and Java APIs.\n\n\nAuthor:\nAkhil Arora\nI work in the Java Language and Tools group at Oracle on blending Java and JavaScript in interesting ways.\nView more trainings by Akhil Arora at https://www.parleys.com/author/akhil-arora\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
