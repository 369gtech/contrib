description: 'A 40-minute dive into the recently announced open source Fn Project - a cloud-agnostic serverless functions platform that allows developers to run their own serverless infrastructure anywhere: datacenter, laptop even Raspberry Pi. Learn how itâ€™s container-native (bring your own Dockerfile), supports any language, and see how the simple yet powerful design has allowed us to build a next-generation resilient distributed programming model on top of FaaS. Expect some live coding, a demo, and maybe some awkward silence.'
