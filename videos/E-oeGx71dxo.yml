description: "Talk recording from AmsterdamJS Conference 2017, June 8 https://amsterdamjs.com\n\nGrigory Petrov, Tech Evangelist at Voximplant\n\nTypescript was warmly welcomed with all our developers from C++, Java and C# background. So it was only a question of time for our public JavaScript SDK to be completely rewritten in Typescript from scratch. In my talk I will focus on good and bad things that we experienced during development, and will tell how our initial thoughts played out."
