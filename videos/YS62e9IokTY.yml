It has many benefits, but it also introduces new challenges. In this talk, we will look at how the Trello team embraced remote and made it work for its growing team. We will discuss why remote work can be good for your team and how to continue to get sh*t done and grow a remote culture. After this talk you will have a clear overview on why remote work can help your organisation, the challenges involved, and many pointers for getting it right.\n\nVincent is Engineering Manager for Trello at Atlassian, looking after scalability and performance. Before that, he led the team which was responsible for moving Atlassian's identity systems towards a microservice architecture. When not thinking about software, Vincent likes a good game of lunchtime soccer in the park with fellow Atlassians."
