description: "www.ng-conf.org\n\nng-conf is a two day, single track conference focused on delivering the highest quality training in the Angular JavaScript framework. 500 to 700 Developers from across the country will converge on beautiful Salt Lake City, UT to participate in training sessions by the Google Angular team, and other Angular experts. In addition to the invaluable training, ng-conf will deliver a premier conference experience for attendees, providing opportunities to network with other developers, relax at social events, and engage in some of the unique entertainment opportunities available in Utah.\n\nBen Teese\nTopic: Rich Data Models & Angular\n\nSuper excited about Angular? Ready to change the world and build a super-heroic app? With directives, Angular has pretty much nailed it when it comes to interacting with the DOM. And plain-old Javascript objects as models? AWESOME! Wait, hang on. Say that you're building a app that has lots of business logic and interrelated data. For that sort of app, history shows us that a rich object model can often be the best place to put your logic and data relationships - from both a testing and ease-of-development perspective. That's the approach that frameworks like Ember advocate - but Ember forces you to extend on its own object model."
