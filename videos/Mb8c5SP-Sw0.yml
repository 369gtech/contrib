description: "Extending Knative for Fun and Profit - Matt Moore & Ville Aikas, Google \n\nCome learn how the Knative building blocks work together with zero baked in knowledge of one another. We will cover a new model for loose coupling in Kubernetes, and show how it is used throughout Knative. We will demonstrate how this model can be used to read and manipulate whole classes of Kubernetes resources. We will also demonstrate how this model can be used with Knative, e.g. to create a new abstractions to receive Events. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPaK"
