title: 'Konrad Kokosa — Make your custom .NET GC — "whys" and "hows"'

description: "Ближайшая конференция — DotNext 2020 Moscow\n2-5 декабря, Online\nПодробности и билеты: https://dotnext-moscow.ru/\n\n. Ближайшая конференция — DotNext\_2020 Piter\n15-18 июня, Online\nПодробности и билеты: https://bit.ly/dotnext2020piter\n\n. Starting with .NET Core 2.1 a new feature called Local GC has been added. It allows you to do magic things — you can completely replace the default GC used by the runtime with your own, or you can use the default GC outside .NET environment. In the session we will look at these possibilities — how and why we can do it. We'll find out exactly where to start writing your own GC and whether it is difficult or not. We will also look at less flexible but still powerful possibilities of GC customization when CLR Hosting is being used.\n\nThe target audience should be interested in advanced memory management topics, as session will be concentrated on the GC customization and GC algorithms in general. The main takeaway for the audience is an inspiration — to encourage experiments with their own GC, or at least to be more aware what is possible on that field."
