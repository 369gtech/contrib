description: "Fluent Bit: Extending Your Logging Pipeline with Go - Warren Fernandes & Jason Keene, Pivotal \n\nFluent Bit is a high-performance and lightweight logging agent implemented in C. Unlike its better known sibling Fluentd, it has fewer plugins for processing and forwarding logs. To facilitate the need for plugins, Fluent Bit has exposed interfaces for writing output plugins in Go.    In this talk Warren and Jason describe how they implemented an output plugin for the syslog protocol whilst explaining the challenges they faced. Topics Include:    - Why Fluent Bit  - An overview of Fluent Bit’s architecture  - How Fluent Bit interfaces between C and Go  - How to write a Go output plugin  - What are the current limitations of Go plugins  - Recent and future improvements to Fluent Bit’s Go interface    This talk would interest those evaluating Fluent Bit to be a part of their logging solution. You’ll learn how extensible it can be by using third-party plugins or by building one of your own! \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPby"
