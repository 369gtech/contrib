title: 'Effective Foreign Function Interfaces: From JNI to JNR'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433784748
description: "What do you do when your application needs access to platform features that aren’t available in the Java platform? You need a foreign function interface (FFI). The Java Native Interface (JNI) is the classic power tool for calling native code from your Java program. Using JNI means stepping out of the managed safety of the JVM into the wilds of native code. This session explains the most common JNI performance and correctness pitfalls and explains how to find and avoid them. As the JVM becomes the runtime of choice for more languages, the FFI landscape is also evolving. This session introduces alternative FFI approaches that minimizes effort (SWIG) and native code. It examines JNR in detail and shows how alternatives perform relative to handwritten JNI.\n\n\nAuthors:\nRyan Sciampacone\nundefined\nView more trainings by Ryan Sciampacone at https://www.parleys.com/author/ryan-sciampacone\n\nThomas Enebo\nundefined\nView more trainings by Thomas Enebo at https://www.parleys.com/author/thomas-enebo\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
