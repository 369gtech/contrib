description: "Big Data Operations Using Kubernetes and Local Storage - Dan Norris, NetApp \n\nMany companies run large, difficult to operate data-processing systems that are key to their business. Kubernetes local storage provides a way to keep running these types complex systems on the infrastructure they were provisioned on while providing a better way to operate in production. In this talk, we'll go over how to use Kubernetes local storage to run complex systems such as Cassandra reliably across multiple datacenters. We'll discuss how the local volume provisioner is used to prepare Persistent Volumes on hosts, how to use Storage Classes to segment workloads on the same host, as well as discussing potential failure modes and how we handle backups. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/Grav"
