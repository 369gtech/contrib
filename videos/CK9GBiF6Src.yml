Primarily, he has focused on building tools for other engineers over the last 18 years; tools for intelligently managing computer network systems, aiding software construction, and analyzing correctness of programs as they evolve.\n\nHis current focus is on creating tools for everyone to foster better living through personal science and behavioral and social science research.
