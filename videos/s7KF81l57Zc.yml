description: "I've looked at clouds from both sides now\nFrom up and down and still somehow\nIt's cloud's illusions I recall\nI really don't know clouds at all\nThe lyrics of Joni Mitchell's song Both Sides Now.\n\nIn this session I will look at big data living in the cloud from both sides, the positive and negative. By the end of this session the illusions are clear and you won't say that you don't know clouds at all.\n\nWe will look at an example of how a large Norwegian company gathers billions of data points from thousands and thousands of devices on all their oil and gas platforms, make it available for analytics and visualize the results in real time. And we will see how the ups and downs of the cloud steered their decision on how to implement the solution. \n\nThe only required prerequisite for this talk is a working brain. You don't have to be a big data developer, I will cover all the V's of the trade."
