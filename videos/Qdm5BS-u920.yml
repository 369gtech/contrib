description: 'We need to carry out security out of the last generation, and prepare it for the next generation. We need to make passwords feel like the ancient technology that they are. We need to abandon our preconceptions that "memorable information" is either secret or memorable. We need to start demanding more from the companies who provide us with the facilities to interact with our peers. We need to protect our right to free speech, and we need to prevent others from speaking on our behalf, without our consent. We need Confidentiality. We need Integrity. We need Availability.'
