description: "Alright, so maybe \"bootiful\" won't ever work, but we tried, and it was worth it too because you're reading this.\n\nSpring Boot, the new convention-over-configuration centric framework from the Spring team at Pivotal, marries Spring's flexibility with conventional, common sense defaults to make application development on the JVM not just fly, but pleasant!\n\nSpring Boot aims to make address the common functional and non-functional requirements that gate quickly moving to production.\n\nThe framework is as clean as it gets, wouldn't it be nice if the language matched its elegance?\n\nKotlin, the productivity-focused language from our friends at JetBrains, takes up the productivity slack to make the experience leaner, cleaner and even more pleasant!\n\nThe Spring and Kotlin teams have worked hard to make sure that Kotlin and Spring Boot are a first-class experience for all developers trying to get to production, faster and safer.\n\nCome for the Spring and stay for the Bootiful Kotlin.\n\nJosh Long is the Spring Developer Advocate at Pivotal. Josh is a Java Champion, author of 5 books (including O'Reilly's upcoming Cloud Native Java: Designing Resilient Systems with Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, and Cloud Foundry) and 3 best-selling video trainings (including Building Microservices with Spring Boot Livelessons with Spring Boot co-founder Phil Webb), and an open-source contributor (Spring Boot, Spring Integration, Spring Cloud, Activiti and Vaadin). He is a huge Kotlin-fan, too."
