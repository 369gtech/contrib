title: 'Tanzu Tuesdays - Unit Testing Done Right With Jakub Pilimon'

description: "“TDD leads to a great design,” they said. “Mocking is bad,” they said. “Integration testing is slow,” they said. “Testable architecture to the rescue,” they said. “If you don’t test, don’t call yourself a developer,” they said. “Code coverage must be 100%,” they said. And so on and so forth.\n\nIn this talk, we’ll tackle some of the testing gotchas. There will be live coding, architecture rants, some slides and (hopefully) much fun. Both senior and junior developers should find something interesting in that testing example.\n\n---\nJakub is a Developer Advocate at VMware, blogger, programmer, and trainer. He loves to tackle complex enterprises with Domain-Driven Design, Test-Driven Development and Spring. Architecture is a main area of interest, too. When he doesn’t program, he rides motorbikes, skis or practices kitesurfing.\n\nHe writes a DZone MVB awarded blog and his pet projects can be found at https://github.com/ddd-by-examples."
