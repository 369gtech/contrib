language: English
recordingDate: 1559040091
description: "AI has enabled so many new opportunities for people to create a positive impact in the world by creating engineering solutions across every industry! However, AI is still evolving and we have to address its limitations as well. In this video, I'll explain 3 major limits of AI - a lack of causal reasoning, vulnerability to adversarial examples, and a lack of interpretability. I'll also explain ways to solve these limits and earn a profit doing so. The next time someone asks you what AI can't currently do, share this video with them. Enjoy!\n\nPlease Subscribe! And like.
