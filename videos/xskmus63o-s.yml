title: 'Adding Intelligence: Unlocking New Insights with AI and Machine Learning'

description: "For many scenarios, the cloud is used as a way to process data and apply business logic with nearly limitless scale. However, processing data in the cloud is not always the optimal way to run computational workloads: either because of connectivity issues, legal concerns, or because you need to respond in near-real time with processing at the Edge. \n\nIn this session we dive into how Azure IoT Edge can help in this scenario. We will train a machine learning model in the cloud using the Azure AI Platform and deploy this model to an IoT Edge device using Azure IoT Hub. \n\nAt the end, you will understand how to develop and deploy AI and ML workloads at the Edge. \n\nAzure IoT Edge: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/?WT.mc_id=sciot-video-cxa\nAI Platform: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/?product=ai-machine-learning&WT.mc_id=sciot-video-cxa\nAzure IoT Hub: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/?WT.mc_id=sciot-video-cxa\nCheck out more on Microsoft Learn: https://aka.ms/IoTelp30"
