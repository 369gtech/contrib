description: "You might think of the Linux kernel as something that only kernel developers need to know about. Not so! It turns out that understanding some basics about kernels and systems programming makes you a better developer, and you can use this knowledge when debugging your normal everyday programs.\n\nEverything in this talk applies to every program, in every programming language. What could be better?"
