description: "Russ Thornton (WorldRemit): How to partner and scale with the big four in tech (Facebook, Amazon, Google, Apple)\n\nFrom IBM and General Motors in the 1970s to General Electric in the 1990s, the US has always produced behemoth corporations that bestride the world. Interestingly, in the last three decades the shift has moved from offline to digital, from services to subscription based revenue models and from an ambition to own customers to tools that farm their data.
