title: '#HITBCyberWeek #CommSec D1 WORKSHOP - Signal Processing With GNURadio And SDRs'
language: English
recordingDate: 1609632099
description: "The world of signals fascinates many in the Security domain. The reason being it is neither visible nor tangible and the techniques of Signal Processing are highly mathematical. Signal Processing is an important part when it comes to security assessment and evaluation of modern communication systems.\n\n\n\nGNURadio is such a powerful tool for Signal Processing and implementing software defined radios. It is open source and one can develop signal processing modules in Python or on GUI Interface easily to either simulate or work with Radio hardwares. This workshop provides a step-by-step hands-on tutorial for Signal Processing using GNUradio with hardware like RTL-SDR, HackRF and Ettus USRP.\n\n\nREQUIREMENTS / TOOLS\n\n\n    GNURadio 3.7 or higher installed.\n    RTL-SDR/ Ettus USRP/ HackRF.\n    Windows / Linux system.\n\n\nKEY LEARNING OBJECTIVES\n\n\n    This workshop is designed for beginner to intermediate level.\n    Basic knowledge of how Signals work.\n    Digital Signal Processing techniques.\n    The mathematics of communication theory and modulation techniques.\n    GNUradio installation and overview of the tool and its components.\n    Building signal processing modules on GNURadio companion.\n    Using SDRs with GNURadio for practical applications.\n    Other useful tools that are required for signal analysis with SDRs and GNUradio.\n\n\n=== \n\n\nAteet Kumar is an Electronics and Communication Engineer having more than 4 years of experience in InfoSec field with expertise in Electromagnetics Security, RF and Signals domain.\n\n\nAteet currently works as Senior Security Researcher in Xen1thLabs where he conducts research in these domains. He has worked for 3 years in Defence Research and Development Organization, India in the areas of Side Channel Analysis and Mobile Security and also published articles in the DRDO internal journals on several topics. Having sound knowledge and experience of Electromagnetics, Antennas and Microwaves he also has interest in Astronomy, Spiritual Sciences and reading books."
