description: "Maarten van Hoof - Why OpenAPI\n\nFront End & OpenAPI: Define, generate, develop.\n\nAs a developer, working with REST API dependencies ain’t all sunshine and rainbows. Security implications, parallel development, time or budget restrictions for writing documentation, …, in an enterprise you might not always have the ability to rely on your REST API dependencies for development, let alone for an automated testing environment.\n\nThe OpenAPI ecosystem offers us solutions in the form of virtually complete independence from a REST API during development and testing.\n\nMaarten will guide you through a high-level overview of what the OpenAPI spec. is and how it can benefit front end development."
