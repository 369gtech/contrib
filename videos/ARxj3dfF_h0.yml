description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nDiscussion & Comments: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2019\n—\nStatic reflection is a forthcoming feature in the C++ programming that promises powerful new features for compile-time introspection of user source code. This feature, supported by increasingly capable constexpr facilities, will potentially be the Next Big Thing for C++23. This talk will cover the core concepts of reflection and reification and discuss several methods of providing language support for those features, including the approach taken by current Reflection TS and alternative approaches that are currently being considered. The remainder of the talk will focus on language and engineering concerns associated with static reflection. In particular, the pervasive use of constexpr functions to Reflect All the Things may cause compile times to balloon. However, I generally believe the benefits of reflection outweigh the potential costs, and if used judiciously, I think there will be only benefits.\n— \n\nAndrew Sutton\nLock3 Software, LLC\nOwner\nKent, Ohio\n\nAndrew Sutton is an owner of Lock3 Software, LLC, a software research and development company in Kent, Ohio. His spends his days working on C++ language extensions in Clang and GCC and working on various WG21 language proposals.\n\nHis past work included the design, specification, and implementation (in GCC) of concepts along with Bjarne Stroustrup and Gabriel Dos Reis. His current big project is language support for reflection and generative metaprogramming, which directly support Herb Sutter's metaclass proposal.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
