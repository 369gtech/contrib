description: "Don't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects - Learn more at https://kubecon.io\n\nKeynote: Containerizing Deep Learning Using Kubeflow on AWS - Sukanya Mandal, Data Scientist, Capgemini \n\nEven though Deep Learning is hyped and is certainly used in many industrial use cases, but the major challenge encountered by those trying to deploy it. Issues such as -- software management (heterogeneity of various frameworks - each with their own deployment methodology) -- composability (built using multiple component - each using different set of languages or toolkit, instead of monolithic architecture) -- portability -- performance optimization -- collaborative development -- scalability -- infrastructure management arise out of the blue when deep learning workflow or pipelines are to be productionized resulting in sleepless nights of the engineers. This talk will particularly cover these pain points and address how containers come to the rescue with a demo on single node and distributed node deep learning training on Amazon EKS using Kubeflow. \n\nhttps://sched.co/YW48"
