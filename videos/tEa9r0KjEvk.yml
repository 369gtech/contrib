title: 'DrupalCon Vienna 2017: Break through large scale Drupal projects with Behat'
recordingDate: 1506424748
description: "In this session, we will go through the basics of behaviour testing\_with Behat and Mink. We will talk about Drupal Extension and the benefits of using it ...but\_the most important part of our session will be real examples of\_successful implementation of these tools in some of our challenging,\_complex and large scale projects such as Syngenta, Københavns Kommune, LUSH,\_Pfizer, Dagrofa and etc.\n\nWe want to share our experience and give some useful ideas and\_approaches from problems solved. All the tools and frameworks for automation are working fine, but when we talk\_about such huge projects all of them become insufficient and there are\_a lot of customizations you need to do.\_\n\nThat's why we are focused on finding a specific framework that has component implemented to work exactly with Drupal, open source and easy to extend, and here it comes the Drupal\_Extension for Behat."
