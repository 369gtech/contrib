description: "This talk is about how Applift tackled the problem of matching fuzzy app names with apps in official app stores at a large scale. To do so, an algorithm that employs TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity was deployed on Kubernetes using Dask to parallelize computations.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nwww.pydata.org \n\n\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
