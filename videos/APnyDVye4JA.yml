description: "Recording brought to you by American Express. https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs\nWhat makes Kotlin a great choice for data-driven systems? The fact you can use one common programming language for both data science and data engineering. With Kotlin, you can fill the gap between local exploratory data analysis and deployment of big data models in production. Not to mention that Kotlin is elegant, and its static typing allows creating neat and friendly APIs.\n\nIn this talk, we’ll make a brief overview of the Kotlin ecosystem as applied to data science, including the tooling and library aspects. Then we’ll go through a practical example covering operations on multidimensional arrays, dealing with data frames, creating charts, and deploying on clusters. The tooling will be presented using #Jupyter, #Zeppelin, and JetBrains’ Big Data Tools.\n\nResources:\nKotlinConf website: https://jb.gg/fyaze5\nKotlinConf on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlinconf\n\nKotlin website: https://jb.gg/pxrsn6\nKotlin blog: https://jb.gg/7uc7ow\nKotlin on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlin\n\nJetBrains Big Data Tools: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/big-data-tools-support.html\n\n#KotlinConf19 #Kotlin #DataScience #JetBrains\n\nAbout the Presenter:\nSoftware Developer @ Kotlin for Data Science\n\nPreviously:\nMarketing Manager @ Kotlin\nSoftware Developer @ dotMemory"
