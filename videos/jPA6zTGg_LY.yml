Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nThe Myth of the Monocluster - Matt Silverlock, Google \n\nBuilding out a single monolithic Kubernetes cluster and trying to migrate all the things rarely, if ever, works out, and Kubernetes doesn't change that. It becomes harder to gather non-conflicting requirements, or avoid scope creep as new teams have what seem like reasonable asks (to them). Not to mention the technical challenges & increased blast radius of a big cluster.    How can we start with smaller teams, help them migrate and operationalize their clusters, learn from the inevitable mistakes, document the shortcuts, and use that as the framework for future teams?    Let's talk through what we need to ask ourselves in order to migrate to Kubernetes, how to divide & conquer (our clusters), and some lessons learnt from working with large organizations. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Uady"
