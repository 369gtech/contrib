description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nKubeEdge 驱动的下一代云原生运行时边缘设备 | KubeEdge Powered Edge-Devices With Next Generation Cloud Native Runtime - Pengfei Jiang, Huawei\n\n随着云本地边缘计算的实现，越来越多的边缘设备需要与.云协作。此外，随着各种专业芯片、硬件加速卡和微机器学习技术的发展，许多通用资源较低的专用设备也需要边缘云协同。因此，轻量级容器沙箱技术需要满足低服务开销、快速启动和服务隔离的要求。为了解决边缘设备的多体系结构系统迁移问题，实现统一的应用运行时，降低开发和维护成本，需要一种统一的跨体系结构运行时技术。\n\nWith the implementation of cloud-native edge computing, more and more edge devices need to collaborate with the cloud. In addition, with the development of various professional chips, hardware acceleration cards, and tinyML technologies, many dedicated devices with low general resources also require edge-cloud synergy. Therefore, lightweight container sandbox technology is required to meet the requirements of low service overhead, fast startup, and service isolation. A unified cross-architecture runtime technology is required to solve the problem of multi-architecture system migration of edge devices, achieving unified application runtime and reducing development and maintenance costs."
