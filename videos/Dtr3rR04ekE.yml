description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nAutoscaling and Cost Optimization on Kubernetes: From 0 to 100 - Guy Templeton, Skyscanner & Jiaxin Shan, Amazon \n\nOne of the great promises of Kubernetes is the ability to scale your applications and infrastructure dynamically based on demand whilst optimising cost no matter where clusters run. Autoscaling workloads and clusters without compromising the performance or availability of your applications is not always simple though.  At Skyscanner, use of the Cluster Autoscaler (CA), Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) and Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) have helped meet traveller demand in a cost effective way. Guy and Jiaxin will walk through hard earned autoscaling lessons, going from the basics to advanced features. This will include using custom metrics with the HPA, the CA’s expanders, scaling from zero, labeling and balancing between node groups to handle different use cases and challenging to scale applications. They will also cover a number of other useful community tools to help with autoscaling.\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zemi"
