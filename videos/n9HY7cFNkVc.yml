title: 'Lambda Jam 2015 - Justin Leitgeb - High Assurance Software: A Practical Overview'
recordingDate: 1445130521
description: "High assurance software development practices are moving from academia into ever-broadening areas of software development. This talk will start by defining high assurance as it is used in the software industry, and describe why software developers should care about such a concept. Rather than focusing on academic principles, this talk will give concrete examples of how several types of “high assurance” software practices can lead to reduced software costs and more predictable development timelines. Specific tools that will be discussed include Haskell, as well as dependent types, and interactive theorem provers such as Coq.\n\nJustin Leitgeb has been in software development for over eighteen years and has worked as a lead developer at startups as well as Fortune 1000 companies. Most of his career has been spent working in dynamically-typed languages such as Perl, Ruby and Clojure. More recently, he has focused on working with statically-typed languages, and he has helped to build a team of Haskell developers working on production projects at Stack Builders. His programming interests outside of Haskell include learning more about type theory, category theory, and interactive theorem proving using tools like Coq and Agda. Justin lives with his wife and two children in Quito, Ecuador, where Stack Builders has a growing office full of lambda-obsessed programmers.\n\nFor more on Lambda Jam, visit http://www.lambdajam.com"
