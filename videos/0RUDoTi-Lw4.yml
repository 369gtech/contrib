description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nKubernetes and Checkpoint Restore - Adrian Reber, Red Hat\n\nOver 6 years ago a ticket (#3949) was opened asking for Pod migration in Kubernetes and until now there is no support in Kubernetes to migrate a container. Container migration is based on checkpointing and restoring containers and checkpointing and restoring containers is one the main reasons Checkpoint/Restore in User-Space (CRIU) exists. Although container migration is always viewed as an outlier or corner case of containers, because containers are supposed to be stateless, CRIU continues to get better at container migration and even if containers are supposed to be stateless, CRIU still sees growing interest in its container migration features and especially the integration in container runtimes. This talk wants to present the multiple use cases for checkpointing and restoring containers. The talk wants to give a technical background how CRIU is enabling container runtimes to checkpoint and restore containers and the plan how to integrate checkpoint and restore into Kubernetes."
