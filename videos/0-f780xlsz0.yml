description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nSponsored Session: Bridgecrew - End-to-end policy-as-code from IaC to Running Workloads\n\nSpeakers: Matt Johnson\n\nInfrastructure as code (IaC) is a cloud-native game-changer. It's modular, reusable, and super shareable, making it easy to get up-and-running fast. Because it's so user-friendly, however, IaC is often subject to security and compliance misconfigurations that can make their way to production resources and workloads.\nThe key to preventing that from happening is adopting policy-as-code and scanning for misconfigurations continuously throughout the development lifecycle.\n\nIn this technical demo, we'll show how Bridgecrew enables exactly that for Kubernetes manifests, Terraform, CloudFormation, and more. You'll see Bridgecrew's complete codified cloud security suite in action—our IDE extension, pre-commit hooks, version control and CI/CD integrations, and runtime scanning."
