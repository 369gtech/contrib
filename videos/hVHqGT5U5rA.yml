title: 'Sustainable Angular Architecture | Manfred Steyer | EnterpriseNG 2020Â #ngconf'
language: English
recordingDate: 1624301541
description: "Monorepos allow huge enterprise applications to be subdivided into small and maintainable libraries. However, this is only one side of the coin: We need first to define criteria for slicing our application into individual parts and establish rules for communication between them.\n\nThis session looks at a solution provided by Strategic Domain-Driven Design. Using an Angular-based case study, we investigate the idea of the ubiquitous language and the bounded context, sub-domains, and context mapping. Building on this, you will learn how to implement these ideas for Angular using a monorepo. We also discuss approaches for reducing coupling between the specific parts of our monorepo.\n\nBy the end, you will have a technical solution and appropriate methodology to build sustainable Angular solutions.\n\nLearn the best ways to build reliable web applications, write quality code, choose scalable architectures, and create effective automated tests at the Reliable Web Summit this August 26-27, 2021.
