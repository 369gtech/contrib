For example, to create histograms, compare periods or view spread in data\n\nJoin this session to learn how you can use\n\nNTILE to create groups with an equal number of rows\nWIDTH_BUCKET to make each group cover an equal range of values\nFormulas to define fixed ranges\n\nHighlights from this session include:\n\n02:30 - Splitting rows into quartiles using NTILE\n06:30 - Creating histograms with equal-sized intervals using WIDTH_BUCKET\n10:00 - Group strings together by starting letter with WIDTH_BUCKET\n13:00 - Demo of using NTILE\n15:30 - Demo of using WIDTH_BUCKET\n22:00 - Demo of ways to group character values\n27:30 - Recap of differences between NTILE and WIDTH_BUCKET\n31:40 - Grouping rows into 5-minute intervals\n33:20 - Demo of splitting data into groups of five rows each\n35:45 - Demo of grouping rows in 5-minute intervals\n42:30 - Demo of RATIO_TO_REPORT\n44:45 - Review of different ways to group rows into \"consistent\" sized bins\n\nGet the scripts for this session https://livesql.oracle.com/apex/livesql/file/content_MD0J8KLQAKL6SOC2UGNCC3VSR.html\n\nPractice your SQL skills with free quizzes https://devgym.oracle.com/pls/apex/dg/competition/sql"
