description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nExtending systemd Security Features with eBPF - Mauricio Vásquez Bernal, Microsoft\n\nsystemd uses eBPF to implement certain functionality like IP filtering and accounting. These features have been traditionally implemented by writing the eBPF code directly in eBPF-assembly. It’s an efficient solution but makes their development and maintainability very difficult. Systemd recently got support for libbpf, which opens the door to adding new features much more easily. In this talk Mauricio will explain how two new security features were implemented in systemd using this new integration: RestrictFileSystems and RestrictNetworkInterfaces. RestrictFileSystems allows limiting the filesystem types that processes in a systemd service have access to and RestrictNetworkInterfaces allows limiting the network interfaces that processes in a systemd can use."
