description: "Gabriel is the founder of Scalar Research, a full-service artificial intelligence & data science consulting firm. Scalar helps companies tackle complex business challenges with data-driven solutions leveraging cutting-edge machine learning and advanced analytics.\n\nEver wonder how Facebook’s facial recognition or Snapchat’s filters work?\n\nFaces are a fundamental piece of photography, and building applications around them has never been easier with open-source libraries and pre-trained models.\n\nIn this talk, we’ll help you understand some of the computer vision and machine learning techniques behind these applications. Then, we’ll use this knowledge to develop our own prototypes to tackle tasks such as face detection (e.g. digital cameras), recognition (e.g. Facebook Photos), classification (e.g. identifying emotions), manipulation (e.g. Snapchat filters), and more."
