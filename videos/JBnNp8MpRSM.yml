description: "The single-threaded nature of JavaScript can make handling lots of data or complex processing in your web application difficult to balance with providing a good user experience. Web Workers promise to help us find that balance and let us build fast and responsive applications even when doing heavy work, but the APIs for working with them leave much to be desired. In this talk, weâ€™ll explore useful patterns for making Web Workers easier to work with and highlight effective ways to communicate between workers, handle complex data processing off the main thread, and test and debug them.\n\nWhat are the key takeaways from this talk?\n- How to use Web Workers to handle complex data processing off the main thread\n- Patterns and libraries to make working with Web Workers easier\n- Strategies for testing and debugging Web Workers\n- Examples of Web Workers being used in real projects\n\nEVENT:\n\nJS Kongress 2019\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nTrent Willis\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nATTRIBUTION CREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voFXsFRc6jU"
