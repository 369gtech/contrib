Ближайшая конференция — DotNext\_2020 Piter\n15-18 июня, Online\nПодробности и билеты: https://bit.ly/dotnext2020piter\n\n. The landscape of distributed applications is rapidly changing from server-based to using clusters of containers and server-less computing. .NET is capable of creating such cross-platform applications, being run in Docker containers, but it is not trivial to get started with this. This session will focus on providing an overview of the changing world for .NET developers, with a new workflow that has Docker and containers at its core. You will learn how Visual Studio 2017, .NET Core and Docker play a strategic role in building, packaging, deploying and running modern .NET applications, and also learn what it takes to develop these apps on your laptop and in container clusters."
