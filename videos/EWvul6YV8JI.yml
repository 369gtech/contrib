title: 'Azure SQL and IoT | Data Exposed'
language: English
recordingDate: 1594915204
description: "IoT is almost always associated with NoSQL database. This is quite understandable as its flexibility and specialization are great for ingesting IoT data. But what if that flexibility and performance are also available in Azure SQL? That would make Azure SQL a perfect target for IoT data as along flexibility and performance you have security, manageability, analytics, and scalability. In this episode, Davide Mauri discusses all this and more - and shows you why Azure SQL is a great option for IoT and HTAP.\n\n[01:14] IoT architecture\n[02:15] Features\n[02:35] Columnstore\n[02:42] Rowstore\n[02:55] Read-scale out\n[03:40] Memory-optimized (lock free) structures\n[04:02] JSON support\n[06:50] Create your own Lambda/Kappa architecture in Azure\n[09:00] What you can do with the data at this scale\n\n‚úîÔ∏è Additional Resources:\nAzure IoT reference architecture: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/iot-with-sql?WT.mc_id=dataexposed-c9-niner \nStreaming At Scale - Azure SQL: https://github.com/Azure-Samples/streaming-at-scale/tree/master/eventhubs-streamanalytics-azuresql?WT.mc_id=dataexposed-c9-niner \nIngesting 10K events/sec Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVrqa0H_rQA?WT.mc_id=dataexposed-c9-niner \nJSON Performance in Azure SQL: https://devblogs.microsoft.com/azure-sql/json-in-your-azure-sql-database-lets-benchmark-some-options/?WT.mc_id=dataexposed-c9-niner \n\nüìå Let's connect:\nTwitter - Davide Mauri, https://twitter.com/mauridb\nTwitter - Anna Hoffman, https://twitter.com/AnalyticAnna \nTwitter - AzureSQL, https://aka.ms/azuresqltw\n\nüî¥ To watch even more Data Exposed episodes, check our playlist: \nhttps://aka.ms/dataexposedyt\n\nüîî Subscribe to our channels for even more SQL tips:\nMicrosoft Azure SQL: https://aka.ms/msazuresqlyt\nMicrosoft SQL Server: https://aka.ms/mssqlserveryt\nMicrosoft Developer:  https://aka.ms/microsoftdeveloperyt\n\n#AzureSQL #IoT #DataExposed"
