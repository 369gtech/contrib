title: 'Spring Framework 5: Hidden Gems by Juergen Hoeller'
language: English
recordingDate: 1510239616
description: "Spring Framework 5.0 brings a lot of refinements all across the framework: some of rather obvious elements of our major programming model themes (functional & reactive)... but also some less prominent and less commonly presented features.\n\nThis brief session highlights a few personal favorites beyond the major themes, as a companion to the \"Spring Framework 5: Themes & Trends\" talk. At the same time, it also serves as a standalone feature update for Spring Framework 4.x users.\n\nJuergen Hoeller is co-founder of the Spring Framework open source project and has been serving as the project lead and release manager for the core framework since 2003. Juergen is an experienced software architect and consultant with outstanding expertise in code organization, transaction management and enterprise messaging."
