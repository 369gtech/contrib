title: 'Maxim Velichkin - Google Tango & Microsoft Hololens - Nike AR Application (DevFest Baltics)'
recordingDate: 1530806519
description: "We will cover some key stages in the process of creation of the 'Nike' augmented reality application for Microsoft Hololens and Google Tango. We will discuss the process of 3D assets creation, including: 3D modeling 3D Sculpting Texturing Normal Map Baking Armature and Shapekey Animation We will also touch some techniques and solutions that allow us to achieve goals that might seem mutually exclusive or difficult to achieve. For example, to maintain a very high level of detail of the 3D model while keeping it suitable for the hardware requirements. Or create a shoe model that can be expanded to individual elements, and at the same time make all of these elements deform together as a single, one-piece object during animation.\n\nMore information about awesome conference: https://devfest.gdg.lv"
