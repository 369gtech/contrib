description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nSecuring Your Healthcare Data with OPA - Martin Pratt, Medudoc & Ash Narkar, Styra \n\nIn this talk, we will describe our “Shift Left” approach to security by using OPA to codify and enforce policies across our microservice architecture.  We will focus on the design of our OPA driven application development process that allows us to define custom security policies using OPA and enforce them by injecting our apps with an Envoy sidecar resulting in policy-enabled apps that are now ready to provide least-privilege access to PHI and PII data of our users.  In our demo we will show real-world examples of how we restrict access to sensitive data as well as how we control inbound and outbound traffic from our apps.\n\nhttps://sched.co/ZemH"
