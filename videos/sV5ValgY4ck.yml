description: "Ju Liu - Master of the useless\nLive coding an Escher painting using Scenic\n\nTalk in three words: Scenic, Escher, Fractal\n\nAbstract\nIn this talk we will be rebuilding \"Square Limit\", a famous painting by M.C. Escher using Scenic and the amazing powers of functional programming. We will build the whole application from scratch, and we will start by taking a look at how Scenic works. We will then proceed to deconstruct the fractal nature of Escher's painting and then rebuild it step by step. By the end of the talk, we should have acquired a good level of understanding on how Scenic works and a lot of respect for Escher's work as a mathematician.\n\nObjectives\nExplain how Scenic works at a basic level - Showcase the power of functional programming - Compose very simple concepts into amazingly complex artifacts.\n\nAudience\nPeople who are interested in Scenic, visual art and fractals.\n\nThe speaker \nJu was born in China, moved to Italy as a kid, grew up eating a lot of pasta, and started messing around with computers. He now lives in London and works for NoRedInk. He loves to solve hard problems and build amazing products. When he’s not doing that, he’s probably rock climbing.\nGithub: Arkham\nTwitter: @arkh4m\n\nElixirConf EU\nWebsite: www.elixirconf.eu\nTwitter: www.twitter.com/elixirconfeu\nMail: info at elixirconfeu"
