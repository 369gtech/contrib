description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nSponsored Session: Splunk - Splunk Opentelemetry \n\nIt has been said that open source software is eating the world and in the observability space, the project behind this movement is OpenTelemetry. The project is currently in beta and is quickly becoming the standard for instrumentation and data collection of observability data. When it comes to observability, there are lots of opinions, but limited answers. Understanding what data to collect and how to collect it properly is fundamental to ensuring users have the ability to address availability and performance issues quickly. Doing so in an open-source and vendor-agnostic way empowers users to instrument once and via configuration select the back-end that best serves their requirements. This talk will discuss the components of the project, how you can get started, and how you can get involved. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ff1h"
