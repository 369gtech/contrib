description: 'The best code is the one you never need to write. Using code generation and automated builds, you can minimize the risk of human error when developing software, but how do you maintain control over code when large parts of it are handed over to a machine? In this tutorial, you will learn how to use open source software to create and control code automation. You will see how you can generate a completely object-oriented domain model by automatically analyzing your database schemas. Every aspect of the process is transparent and configurable, giving you, as a developer, 100 percent control of the generated code. This will not only increase your productivity but also help you build safer, more maintainable Java applications.'
