description: "\"AsyncIO in production - War Stories\n[EuroPython 2019 - Talk - 2019-07-12 - Osaka / Samarkand]\n[Basel, CH]\n\nBy Michal Wysokinski\n\nMy team has been running AsyncIO in production for over 2 years now and the only thing I can say about my experience with it is: \"\"Oh boy, what a rollercoaster of feelings\"\". I've experienced laughs and tears, sweat and blood but also sang songs of glory. AsyncIO is currently the biggest buzzword in the Python world advertised as a silver bullet capable of solving all Python's shortcomings in the field of performance. However, it also brings a burden of being a completely new approach with a fresh implementation which is not often mentioned and taken into consideration. In some of my team's projects we've achieved a great success thanks to AsyncIO, but there's been a few where we decided to get rid of it and replace it with a more traditional fork-join architecture. I'd like to share my experience with AsyncIO, tell some War Stories and discuss which projects it suits perfectly and which ones should avoid it.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2019.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/"
