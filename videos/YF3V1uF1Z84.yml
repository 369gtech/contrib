description: "Lean AI – How to Implement a Production-Ready Deep Learning Model in Twelve Weeks \n\nMany data science and machine learning projects fail which then cause high risks for companies. In product development, there is a concept though called “lean startup” which is all about minimizing risks. In this talk, I will present how lean concepts can be used for ML projects and how both of them are actually very related to each other. I will also present a project that we’re currently working on where we applied those ideas. And yes it’s a cool deep learning project."
