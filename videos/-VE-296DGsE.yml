description: "OTP, the Middleware for Concurrent Distributed Scalable Architectures\n\n While Erlang is a powerful programming language used to build distributed, fault tolerant systems with requirements of high availability, these complex systems require middleware in the form of reusable libraries, release, debugging and maintenance tools together with design principles and patterns used to style your concurrency model and your architecture.\nIn this talk, Francesco will introduce the building blocks that form OTP, the defacto middleware that ships with the Erlang/OTP distribution. He will cover OTP's design principles, describing how they provide software engineering guidelines that enable developers to structure systems in a scalable and fault tolerant way, without the need to reinvent the wheel.\n\n\n\n\n\nLiked the song?
