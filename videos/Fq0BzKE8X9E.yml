description: "Although Apache Kafka is now a very common technology, it is surprising to see that many users do not really know how it works internally. This talk will give you a brief overview of Apache Kafka, its internals and its supporting landscape.\n\nIf you never heard about Apache Kafka, come along to learn about this important technology. \nIf you heard about Apache Kafka but are unsure how it works, join this talk to learn about some of its internals and how it will affect how you deploy your cluster and how you write your applications using it.\nIf you know all the internals of Apache Kafka or maybe even contributed to its sources, come along anyway - you might just learn something new or surprising.\n\nThe speech took on 8th May 2019 on DataTech Stage during Infoshare 2019.\n\n#DevOps #Bigdata #DataTech #Kafka #Tech"
