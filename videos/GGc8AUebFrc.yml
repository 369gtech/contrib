description: "by Ludovic Dubost\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/UD2.119/collab_wntk.webm\n\n\nIt is often difficult to untangle technical choices made when designing systems from the values and implicit assumptions of its those systems' designers. \n\nFor many developers of open-source software, radical openness and permissionless participation have become the de facto methodology to follow when designing collaboration systems. This ideology has driven the creation of a wealth of information systems and collaboratively curated data sets which could not have been created in a top-down fashion. Consequently, different values, and thus different architectures have remained largely unexplored. \n\nThis lecture will present CryptPad, a web-based suite of collaborative tools which employs client-side encryption to restrict access to those who possess the cryptographic keys which are unique to each document. I will include an overview of the underlying architecture, and provide insight into its design process and the values that it encodes. \n\nThis talk was originally proposed by Aaron MacSween. \n\nRoom: UD2.119\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 15:25:00+01"
