description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2020 by Jeroen Mols, Plaid.\n\nMore info: https://android-makers-2020.firebaseapp.com/schedule/?sessionId=174736\n\nEver wish you could just use a lambda as an onClickListener? Or change the View visibility by modifying a simple \"isVisible\" boolean? Or how about using a doOnLayout{} method to run a block of code after view layout?\r\n\r\nThese are just a few examples of how Android KTX extensions help solve common problems. They improve the existing Jetpack and Android platform APIs so you can consume them from Kotlin in a concise and idiomatic way.\r\n\r\nThis talk will discuss what KTX extensions are and explore the most useful extensions that you can use in your daily workflow."
