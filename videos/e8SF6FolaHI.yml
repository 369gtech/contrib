title: 'Никита Волков. Declarative JDBC'
recordingDate: 1472730827
description: 'JDBC is notorious for its unwieldiness. The API is highly intertwined and often inconsistent. This is the reason why most applications based on JDBC are prone to end up being a code spaghetti and a torture to maintain. In this talk I''m going to present djdbc, a library providing the solutions to problems of JDBC using just a few simple abstractions nudging the user towards the declarative style of programming. No frills involved: no metaprogramming, reflection or magical annotations. Just a few simple abstractions applying the best practices of isolation of concerns to make your persistence layer comprehendable and maintainable, without losing the ability to apply the extended features of JDBC. This library is in major part inspired by my other project hasql, which is a PostgreSQL integration library for the Haskell functional programming language and backs the popular Postgrest project. Having such a background djdbc incorporates some great practices from the functional programming world, while still targeting the Java audience, as well as any other JVM language.'
