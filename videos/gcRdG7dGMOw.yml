description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2018\n—\nWith the advent of IoT and industry 4.0 there has been a lot of hype \nlately around bare metal and low level embedded software development. \nMany make a distinction between C++ developers with and without \nembedded experience, but what is really the difference when developing \nin this domain and why is C still widely considered the pragmatic \nchoice. One of the crucial factors which is not well understood \noutside of this domain are Interrupt Sercive Routines (ISRs). In order \nto create a better understanding, this talk is a deep dive from no \nprevious experience all the way to an expert level understanding of \nthis feature. In this talk we will cover topics like jitter, latency, \npriority inversion, starvation as well as the fundamental problems \nISRs cause in many mainstream C++ design patterns and even core \nlanguage features. I will also argue that ISRs change the basic \ninterface with regard to library abstractions and we will explore what \nthe alternate basic interface should look like.\n— \nOdin Holmes, Auto-Intern GmbH\nchaos monkey\n\nOdin was allocated from a pool of hippies in the middle of the forest. He spent most of his career designing electronic circuits and programming micro controllers in assembler. One day after having shot himself in the foot particularly badly a friend introduced him to C++, a seriously powerful and ongoing addiction followed. Odin has authored many proof of concept libraries in the embedded field and is trying to revolutionize this domain. Odin co-authored the kvasir::mpl library, co-founded the embo.io conference and was a heavy contributor to the brigand library. In his day job, he teaches people how to shoot themselves in the foot less and get more from their compiler, both with his in-house team as well as in a training and consulting role.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
