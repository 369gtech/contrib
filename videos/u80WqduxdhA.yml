title: 'Rust in the Linux Kernel'
language: English
recordingDate: 1617746360
description: "This talk explores Rust, a C-compatible programming language from Mozilla, and the limits of its interoperability with C code. The featured code began as an exploratory project to program in the kernel with the goal of implementing a module in Rust using as much existing kernel tooling as possible to accomplish the task. Topics covered will include a brief overview of Rust and its safety and compatibility guarantees, leveraging the kernel build system for use with a Rust project, potential problems and drawbacks to look out for when using Rust in the kernel, and ultimately a demo of the kernel module itself. The target audience is those familiar with the basics of kernel programming and more advanced C knowledge, but the talk will intentionally provide background for those unfamiliar with kernel programming to follow along.\n\n***\n\nZeet helps anyone deploy and scale like the top tech companies, without the work.
