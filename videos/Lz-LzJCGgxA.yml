You need to convince the business not to plan for years ahead but to \"build, measure and learn\" in small iterations and gain the most value out of your product. To achieve this you need agile minds, tools and also a platform that can handle that agility. This is a case study of how an established company, dealing in legit business, accomplished some amazing things. This talk will be about how we started in a rush with Spring Boot on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and adopted our technology stack to Axon Framework - based event sourcing mid-project. Then, how maintaining our AWS stack kept us more and more distracted from developing actual business value and how we finally found our home on the Pivotal Cloud Foundry platform, hosted on AWS.\n\nSpeaker:\nDaniel Basten\nSenior Software Engineer, Talanx Group, Talanx Systeme AG\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
