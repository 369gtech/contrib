description: "by Jeroen Baten\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/K.3.401/retro_mainframe_on_laptop.webm\n\nYes, this talk is about running your own mainframe on your own hardware. Mainframes are old, yes, but they are still very much alive. New hardware is still being developed and there are a lot of fresh jobs in this area too. A lot of mainframes run COBOL workloads. COBOL is far from a dead language. It processes an estimated 85% of all business transactions, and 5 billion lines of new COBOL code are written every year. In this session the speaker will help you in take your first steps towards running your own mainframe. If you like then after this session you can continue to build your knowledge of mainframe systems using the links provided during the talk. Come on in and learn the basics of a completely different computer system! And it will take you less than an hour to do that!\n\nRoom: K.3.401\nScheduled start: 2020-02-01 16:55:00"
