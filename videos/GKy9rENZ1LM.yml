description: "Deploying UAA to Cloud Foundry and using within your Applications - Dr. Nic Williams, Stark & Wayne\n\nYour organization can easily centralize its user accounts and authentication across applications using the CF UAA -- yes, the same UAA that sits inside Cloud Foundry. Your applications integrate with the UAA using the industry standard OAuth2, and you have a range of ways to optionally integrate the UAA to backend directories of users. You can even theme the UAA for your company.\n\nIn this talk we discuss how to run the UAA locally for development of local apps, and how to run the UAA in Cloud Foundry. Weâ€™ll cover configuration, and how to make major theme changes to the UAA. We will investigate the https://github.com/starkandwayne/quick-uaa-deployment-cf and its sister projects that make deploying the UAA to various target environments quick and fun.\n\nAbout Dr Nic Williams\nUser and evangelist of Cloud Foundry, Kubernetes, Concourse CI, and BOSH. Author of books Concourse Tutorial and Ultimate Guide to BOSH. Awarded Cloud Foundry Champion 2018. CEO of Stark & Wayne.\n\nhttps://www.cloudfoundry.org/"
