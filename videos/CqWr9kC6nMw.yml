title: 'DEFCON 29 IoT Village - Elazari Tarkhanyan and Cheruvu  -   Establishing IoT Trustworthiness'
language: English
recordingDate: 1630443228
description: 'The Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem holds tremendous promise to promote innovation and productivity, and societal benefits. Yet, with increased connectivity, concerns remain with the growing attack surface. While the DFECON community often focuses on the security aspects of these issues, the multidimensional nature of IoT devices and the combination of AI/ML solutions, sparked standardization activities focusing more generally on the concept of “IoT trustworthiness”. This talk will introduce the audience to the latest developments in the IoT Security Policy landscape, proposals for confidence/certifications mechanisms emerging globally, and key IoT Security baseline standards developments, while exploring the connection to the IoT trustworthiness concept across the IoT Supply Chain. We will describe a case study of IoT robustness and trustworthiness applied in context of AI and smart analytics, including the importance of characterizing the behavior of data.'
