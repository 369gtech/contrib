description: "Kotlin is one of the most exciting and rapidly adopted JVM languages to come along in some time. Whether you write back end code or mobile apps, it seems Kotlin is everywhere. If you've ever wanted to dive into Kotlin but couldn't find the time or a suitable guide, this is your lucky day.\n\nI have been using Kotlin since the early days and would love to guide you from 0 to Kotlin in 3 short hours. We'll start from the basics and progress our way through broader and more exotic topics in an attempt to give you the greatest exposure to the breadth and depth of Kotlin. We'll look at the functional aspects of the language and standard libraries. We'll talk about coroutines for a while. And we'll cover one of the most important aspects of Kotlin development: interoperability with the Java ecosystem and how you can take your new Kotlin skills and use them alongside your Java colleagues, with a little fuss as possible.\n\nExpect to have an educational and fun time exploring Kotlin and at the end, hopefully you'll be as excited to write Kotlin as I am."
