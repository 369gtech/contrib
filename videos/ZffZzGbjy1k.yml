description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nCoreDNS Deep Dive: Building Custom Plugins - Yong Tang, Ivanti\n\nCoreDNS is a cloud-native DNS server with a focus on service discovery. While best known as the default cluster DNS for Kubernetes, CoreDNS is very flexible and extensible for any new features thanks to its plugin-based architecture: new functionalities can be easily added as plugins with Golang. In this session, we will take a detailed look at the plugin system of CoreDNS. We will walk through the complete code of a demo plugin from the scratch to showcase the simplicity and ease of convenience of CoreDNS plugins. We also provide updates and future roadmap of CoreDNS and the community event in this session."
