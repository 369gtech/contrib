description: "** Edureka IoT Training: https://www.edureka.co/iot-certification-training **\nLooking for the right kind of development boards for your IoT projects? It obviously boils down to either the Raspberry Pi or the Arduino. Now, while both might look very similar, but they’re actually very different. They’re both designed for separate utilities and are used under different circumstances. So, it is very important to know when to use which to get the best out of your projects while keeping the entire system energy-efficient and minimal. I’ve explained how the electronic control provided by both these popular boards differ and pointed out their key differences so that you understand which one of these single board systems are better suited to the needs of your projects. \n\nSubscribe to our channel to get video updates.

The best part is live instruction, with playback. But my favourite feature is viewing a previous class. Also, they are always there to answer questions, and prompt when you open an issue if you are having any trouble. Added bonus ~ you get lifetime access to the course you took!!! ~ This is the killer education app... I've taken two courses, and I'm taking two more.”"
