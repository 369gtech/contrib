description: "POST No AWS Bills: Cloud Cost Optimization without APIs\n\nCorey Quinn, The Duckbill Group\n\nAWS bills (and, to a lesser extent, those of other cloud vendors) are vast and deep, out of necessity. It's normal to feel overwhelmed when staring at them. What should you care about? What shouldn't you care about? There's gotta be a better way to control, optimize, and manage your spend past \"buy some reserved instances!\" This talk covers advanced concepts about AWS bills, how finance's understanding of the bill can misalign with engineering's, and what can be done to influence spend without disrupting your engineers for two years with demands to rewrite everything.\n\nhttps://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa19/conference-program"
