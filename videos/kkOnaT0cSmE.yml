Kubernetes 1.19 version started to provide support for graceful node shutdown. The community has made many efforts to ensure this feature. A beginner who has been admiring Kubernetes for a long time starts with familiarity with the community development environment and participates in it, familiarizes with Kubernetes step by step, and then participates in the development of a small feature-graceful node shutdown based on Pod priority The content of this sharing is as follows: Why do we need graceful node shutdown Participated in the development of graceful node shutdown based on Pod priority Gradually understand Kubernetes community development and collaboration"
