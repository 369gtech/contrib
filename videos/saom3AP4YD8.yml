description: "Jana is an active woman in tech. She is a Dart programmer, a Google Developer Expert, co-founder, and has been recognized by first Czech Forbes Woman magazine as a member of the “Czech IT crowd”.\n\nIn 2016, Google publicly announced the new Firebase platform to the general public, but there was no official, public Dart library for Firebase at the time. Jana jumped on the opportunity to build and open source a Dart library for Firebase. After a few months, her “Dart Firebase3 lib” became the official Google Firebase library and was added to Google's GitHub repository.\n\nCheck out Jana's Google Developer Expert profile: https://goo.gl/pndhVu\n\nDart Wrapper for Firebase on GitHub: https://goo.gl/4CktRR\n\nJoin the local developer community in your city through Meetup: https://goo.gl/jGN6bu\n\nSubscribe to the Google Developers Channel: http://goo.gl/mQyv5L"
