recordingDate: 1506326713
description: "When you release your software and products into the world, you open yourself up to the gamut of possibilities. This includes negative feedback from customers that can leave even the most experienced developer unprepared.\n\nThis is something that applies to every developer and unfortunately usually doesn’t get addressed until it is too late, causing entire product pivots for non-issues.\n\nHow can you stay on track when everything you hear tells you you’re wrong?\n\nObjectives:\nProvide developers with a framework for filtering customer requests while still keeping them engaged\nProvide teams with a perspective on how to understand their customer"
