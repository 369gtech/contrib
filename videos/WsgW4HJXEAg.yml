recordingDate: 1493363841
description: "Designing a programming language has a strong subjective component.\nThere are features - such as type and property inference - that many would agree are useful, subject to proper language integration. But then there are features of which utility is not immediately obvious, and that could go either way when it comes to community adoption and scaling up to real, large programs. This talk discusses three such features of D - seemingly unimportant, maybe greeted with a ho-hum by the community, but today ubiquitously used and enjoyed."
