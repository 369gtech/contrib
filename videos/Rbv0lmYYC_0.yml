description: "In a world drowning in terminology, how do we make sense of the current trends in IT: XaaS, Cloud Native, Micro Services, Containers, Agile, Continuous Delivery, Platforms, Abstraction, Dev Ops, IoT, Reactive Programming. What do they all mean? How should you consume them?\n\nThis talk reviews recent IT trends and how platforms like Cloud Foundry instigate change, both technically, and more importantly, organizationally. For example how do you structure your teams, how does Cloud Foundry help with continuous delivery? The essence of Cloud Foundry is not what it is, or even what it can do, it is about what it can do for you. That's what this talk will unpack.\n\nSpeaker: Duncan Winn, Pivotal"
