At Alibaba, we believe Kubernetes is the ideal platform for running Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) and managing blockchain applications.   In this topic, we will share architecture and design of Alibaba Cloud's Blockchain service, which is developed atop Kubernetes. We will dive into how Kubernetes support Hyperledger Fabric with resource orchestration, elastic scaling, and uniform foundation across public, private and hybrid cloud. Moreover, we will talk about production-proven solutions and tips for solving typical pain points of running Fabric on Kubernetes, like cross-VPC consortium network, chaincode container mgmt, storage sizing & mgmt, high availability, etc. At the end of the topic, a demo will be presented to show how easy to build up a cross-company digital asset business application network using BaaS of Alibaba Cloud. \n\nTo learn more click here:  https://sched.co/FuLn"
