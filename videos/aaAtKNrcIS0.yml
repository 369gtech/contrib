description: "What can a rogue fighter pilot from the 1960’s teach us about software architecture? Quite a lot, as it turns out. In 1964, John Boyd introduced ””energy-maneuverability”” theory. It showed that the fastest airplane didn’t always win the dogfight. Rather, the one that could accelerate or decelerate fastest would win.\n\nSoftware architecture today is about gaining and shedding mass rapidly. One must scale up and scale down, and be able to adapt quickly to changing situations. Sadly, enterprise integration destroys maneuverability more often than it helps.\n\nAs architects, we can change the way we integrate systems to produce maneuverability, via some different techniques and patterns. Some of these techniques may appear to contradict past notions of sound architecture. Our industry evolves rapidly, however, and last year’s sound practice might just be drag this year.\n\nMichael Nygard is the Vice President of Customer Solutions at Cognitect. Mike is the author of Release It!, and a contributor to Beautiful Architecture. Mike focuses on highly-available and scalable commerce systems but can often be found coding, writing, speaking, or thinking about how the Universe works.\n\nMike’s most recent projects at Cognitect include designing an architecture for an online P2P lending platform, advising one of the world’s largest financial services firms on their overall software direction, and designing a software defined data center for another financial services firm.\n\nMike’s background includes re-engineering and operating some of the most prominent – and busiest – web properties in the world, including Best Buy, American Airlines and Hyatt. Mike also architected the software used to process 60% of all school photos in the US. Mike wrote the original control software for the infrared astronomy instruments at the Keck Telescope in Hawaii and programmed ground-based GPS systems for the USAF.\n\nFor more on YOW!
