description: "Platform Automation the Pivotal Way: How I Learned to Stop Typing and Love the Operations Manager - Alan McGinlay, Pivotal\n\nOperational efficiency is a key goal in the world of cloud platforms, but how you get there is your choice.\n\nThe Pivotal Network and Pivotal Cloud Foundry Operations Manager provide customers with cosy browser interfaces for deploying and upgrading robust distributed systems without you ever getting your hands really dirty. But where's the catch?\n\nWith major releases of Pivotal Cloud Foundry scheduled every quarter and the spectre of critical vulnerability lurking around every corner, your business depends upon a reliable and repeatable strategy for repaving all your instances with confidence and speed. The words \"mouse\" or \"keyboard\" should not feature in your solution, but where does that leave us with the Operations Manager?\n\nIn this session, Alan will discuss his experiences with the Operations Manager and how a chance encounter with the Ops Manager API led to some deep dives and a new way of thinking about CI/CD in the platform space. \n\nAbout Alan McGinlay\nAlan is a Principal Technical Instructor for Pivotal. Using Cloud Foundry with a sprinkling of cloud-native development magic, Alan enables customers across a number of verticals to transform the way they build and deploy modern software. Alan is the primary contributor to Pivotal's Cloud Foundry Administrator course on Google Cloud Platform and recently delivered the Spring Cloud Services pre-conference training event at SpringOne Platform in San Francisco."
