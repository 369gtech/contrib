description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2014.\nSpeaker: Steve Pember\nG&G Special Topics\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/reactive-grails\n\nThe natural tendency for application developers is to construct their code in a procedural, synchronous, monolithic pattern. Veteran developers know that this leads to error prone, unscalable, slow software - yet it is alarmingly prevalent. There have been several architectural patterns that have risen over the years which have attempted to mitigate this problem. One of the most popular has been Service Oriented Architecture, which involves breaking the monolithic application into a distributed system of several smaller services.\n\nIn this talk, I argue that SOA is a decent start, but not nearly good enough. I will discuss the tenants of the Reactive Pattern and the importance of moving away from Monolithic to Reactive architectures. We will discuss the various Groovy-friendly technologies that allow us to build distributed, micro-service based applications and cover effective communication strategies between each service. We will see how being Reactive is the only viable architecture for large, efficient, scalable systems.\n\nIf Reactive is new to you, this should be an excellent introduction."
