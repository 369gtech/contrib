description: "I will review the state of quantum computing research, focusing on leading technologies and approaches. One approach in particular, topological quantum computing, is poised at the forefront of physics. This approach aims to create a new kind of delocalized state in a condensed matter system, the so-called Majorana zero mode, that will allow quantum information to be manipulated by braiding particles around one another. The state has been found. Can it be braided?\n\nEVENT:\n\nOredev 2016\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nCharles Marcus\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nOredev Conference Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to publish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOredev Conference: http://oredev.org/"
