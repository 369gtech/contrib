recordingDate: 1518957182
description: "Living front-end styleguide - it is a buzzword for many, a goal for some, but a reality for very few. Why? You know why they are necessary. You know how to implement them technically. But do you know how to start? From this talk you will learn how to introduce living styleguides in an existing product and how to start with it from scratch. We will show you how to set the process right: what changes should be made in the tools the team is using and in the mindset of its members. We will point out problems with the implementation of styleguide-driven approach and suggest ways to overcome them.\n\nWhen and how should the team jump into styleguide-driven development? Should it be done straight away, at the very start of the project? Is it too late to approach it when the product is already live? What to start with if it is redesign? And probably most difficult - how to sell this idea to the team and the product owners?\n\nIn this presentation you will learn:\nWhat changes must be made in the team and the development process and how to minimize them;\nHow does transition to SDD for an existing project differs from starting from scratch and why it matters;\nHow to introduce SDD to the stakeholders and have their buy-in."
