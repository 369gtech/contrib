description: "Spring Cloud Function provides a serverless programming model for Spring Boot applications, abstracting away all of the transport details and infrastructure, allowing you to keep all the familiar tools and processes, and focus firmly on business logic.\nIn this session, Dr. Dave Syer explores the current landscape of Serverless platforms, including Riff (which is at the heart of Pivotal Function Service), and explains how Spring Cloud Function can integrate with these platforms.\n\nLinks:\nhttps://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-function\nhttps://projectriff.io/"
