title: '2FA 2Furious by Matthew Gilliard'
recordingDate: 1581886351
description: "With data breaches making the headlines more and more often, and password re-use still common, we have a duty (and often a legal requirement) to implement better security for our users. haveibeenpwned.com now reports on over 8 billion compromised accounts, and new hacks take place frighteningly often. You might know that Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is a tool that can help, but do you really know how it works?\n\nIn this talk Matthew will explain the different approaches for implementing 2FA, including live coding in Java that shows where those 6-digit authentication codes come from, how they are verified, and how to integrate 2FA into your app. You'll come away recognizing the need for 2FA, and understanding the different approaches for implementing a solution that's right for your application. Together we'll make the web a safer place.\n\nMatthew Gilliard\nTwilio\n\nRecorded at Jfokus 2020 in Stockholm 5th of february\nhttp://www.jfokus.se"
