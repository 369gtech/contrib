language: English
recordingDate: 1521645068
description: "Many cities offer comprehensive open data portals, with APIs that provide information on various types of government activities. Making this data publicly available makes governments more accessible and accountable to the communities they serve. Given the right tools to mine and analyze this data, businesses and citizens just might develop new and innovative apps that take full advantage of the data provided. In this session, we’ll take look at a few of the over 750 public data sets provided by the City of New York and show how anyone can use Cloud-based Low Code tools, like Oracle Application Express to easily build powerful data analysis tools that tap into data like expenditures, 311 service requests, demographic and education data.\n\nMarc Sewtz is a Senior Software Development Manager at Oracle Corporation in New York City. With over 20 years of industry experience, Marc held roles in Consulting, Sales and Product Development.
