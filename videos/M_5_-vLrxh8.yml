description: 'Ah, the promises of a Microservices platform. A decoupled solution with many small manageable units of work - each with independent deployment lifecycles. More features, faster, and with fewer regressions. Asynchronous communications, messaging and eventual consistency bliss. Full visibility over system operations and health. Easy to produce history tables and audit logs. Developer productivity and containers everywhere. Unlimited scale. It sounds fantastic right? And, it can be, for some. Will you be one of them? This keynote will contemplate how to survive the seductive world of microservices as a solution architecture - with the many pitfalls in mind - and the reasons why it''s worth the effort.'
