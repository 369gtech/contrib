description: "Functional Programming has shown the benefits of removing mutation and side-effects, resulting in programs fundamentally simpler and more composable. Nonetheless, many of these programs still rely on applying side-effects to external systems such as databases, file-systems or external services. This talk looks at applying these ideas to systems architecture, and how it can make whole systems fundamentally simpler to build, operate and reason about.\n\nFunctional approaches to architecture have other key benefits such as being naturally suited to audit and reversion of state to previous versions. They tend to have lower operational risk associated with them.\n\nThis talk looks at the history of systems built with an underlying functional architectures such as journaled file-systems and databases, event sourcing, and content-addressable storage, as well as the application of these ideas in programs such as Lucene and git.\n\nWe'll see that there is an underlying philosophy of FP that can be brought to most aspects of system design and architecture, even while presenting a mutable face to the world.\n\nFor more on YOW!
