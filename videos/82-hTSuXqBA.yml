title: 'O''Reilly Strata Online Conference, Part 1: Top-down: What CEOs Can Do to Accelerate Data Mindsets'
recordingDate: 1323753262
description: "Everyone buys in to the mantra of the data-driven enterprise. Companies that put data to work make smarter decisions than their competitors. They can engage customers, employees, and partners more effectively. And they can adapt faster to changing market conditions. It's not just internal data, either: a social, connected web has given us new firehoses to drink from, and combining public and private data yields valuable new insights.\n\nUnfortunately for many businesses, the information they need is languishing in data warehouses. It's accessible only to Business Intelligence experts and database experts. It's encased in legacy databases with arcane interfaces.\n\nBig Data promises to unlock this data for the entire company. But getting there will be hard: replacing decades-old platforms and entire skill sets doesn't happen overnight. In this online event, we'll look at how Big Data stacks and analytical approaches are gradually finding their way into organizations, as well as the roadblocks that can thwart efforts to become more data-driven. \n\nPart 1: Diego Saenz (Data Driven CEO), Jonathan Bruner (Forbes Media):\n\nBy putting data to work, companies can outmaneuver their markets. Doing so is as much a cultural change as it is a technical one. In this session, Jonathan Bruner of Forbes talks with Diego Saenz, a veteran of Fortune 500 companies and startups—and the founder of the Data-Driven CEO—to understand how the irresistible force of Big Data meets the immovable mountain of Big Enterprise."
