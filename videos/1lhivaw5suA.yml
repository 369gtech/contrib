description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nPanel: Tech Community Share Out: Maintaining a Healthy Balance with Work - Chris Lentricchia, SUSE; David McAllister, Scalyr; PJ Hagerty, DevRelate.io, OSMIhelp.org; Nanci Lancaster, Linux Foundation; & Amanda Brazzell, Brazzell Business \n\nThe digital age has brought us multitudes of advancements - from cost and convenience to connectivity - but those advancements have also left us fundamentally unbalanced, and often, unhealthy. As we advance further into an always-on culture that has developed through over-connectivity, overwork, and constant sensory overload, it has become essential to maintain a healthy balance with both work and technology.  At KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in Barcelona, the OSMI Handbook did a great job of outlining some tips that attendees can use to maintain their mental health at such large events. Weâ€™d like to take that conversation a step further by talking about some techniques that the Cloud Native Community can use in their lives, both personally and professionally. Join us for a diverse panel discussion to share ideas on maintaining a healthy and balanced mental state. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Uadm"
