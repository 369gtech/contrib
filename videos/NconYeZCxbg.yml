description: "Test automation is almost mandatory for projects that demand high quality as well as short release cycles. It acts as safety net in order to protect existing functionality against bugs resulting from unintended side-effects of recent changes. Developers \"in the trenches\" often automate their tests but don't practice strict TDD. That's a shame, because TDD has additional benefits like improved design and a more focused personal workflow. So if you invest a lot of time in writing tests, make sure not to miss the additional potential of TDD while you're at it.\nIn this session (45min. talk) you will learn, how \"Strict TDD\" can help you to reach a better software design and a more focused personal workflow."
