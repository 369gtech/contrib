Many out-of-browser environments for running WebAssembly have emerged, including proxy-wasm, Krustlet, and WASI.\n\nWhy is WebAssembly gaining a presence outside the browser?\nThe key lies in the fact that WebAssembly has multiple advantages that were not previously available, especially safeness and openness.\n\nIn this talk, I will summarize what features of WebAssembly are giving rise to a wide variety of applications in the world outside the browser, and reflect on how \"WebAssembly outside the browser\" is a great idea and its impact on application security."
