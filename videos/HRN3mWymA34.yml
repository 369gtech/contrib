description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nDeveloping the Kubernetes Python Client - Scott Lee, Facebook \n\nThe Kubernetes Python client allows users to programmatically interact with clusters using the Python language. With Python being one of the most popular programming languages, the Python client provides a way for those unfamiliar with Golang to still reap the benefits of a code interface to Kubernetes. This session will cover the repositories and resources that are used to generate the Python client and dive into examples of how the client is used.  This talk will also cover how to get involved as a contributor to the Python client by covering processes and resources.  Note: Brendan Burns gave a talk titled \"!go, Interacting with and Extending Kubernetes in a Polyglot World\" but it covered Kubernetes clients generally while this talk is specifically about the Kubernetes Python client and dives deeper into the nuances of the client and how to get involved as a contributor.\n\nhttps://sched.co/ZetU"
