description: "What's Happening in CF-Extensions - Michael (dr. max) Maximilien, IBM\n\n\"As CloudFoundry gains more mainstream acceptance as the one stop shop Cloud Operating System for enterprises, the evolution of the platform is shifting away from re-engineering, or innovating on core components, to rather investing in enabling a vibrant ecosystem of extensions. With that aim, late in 2016, the Program Committee Council (PMC) which controls the direction of the platform, voted to create a separate, distinct, committee responsible to seeing the evolution of all extensions in CloudFoundry: called the CF-Extensions PMC with Michael Maximilien (aka Dr.Max) of IBM as its first leader.\n\nIn this talk Dr.Max will provide a summary (including statistics) of what has happened in the CF-Extensions PMC in 2017, including technical summary of the hot new projects, and those that are about to graduate from incubation to core projects. Additionally, Dr.Max will unveil the CF-Extensions PMC project on GitHub that help summarize the ever growing current pipeline of proposed and incubating projects and where each is in the process. Finally, looking forward to 2018, Dr.Max will also share where he and the community (those voicing their opinions) would like to see the platform evolve towards.\""
