description: "Wes Warner\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/182/\n\nIn this session, I will showcase our middle school STEM program with particular emphasis on how at Pacific Lutheran College implements a problem-based learning approach to its STEM program.  Artefacts our students create include rollercoasters, solar ovens, light projects, and underwater drones.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n#linux.conf.au #linux #foss #opensource\n\nMon Jan 13 13:30:00 2020 at Room 9"
