title: 'Using Pomelo to Enhance Algorithmic Thinking'
language: English
recordingDate: 1568627741
description: "We have designed Pomelo, an interactive robot that teaches algorithmic thinking through collaborative tasks and games. With Pomelo we aim to drag the interest of young children into programming both in and outside of classroom environments.\n\nSchools provide great opportunities and methods so that children can learn subjects like maths or sciences at school. However, children commonly lack basic yet vital skills of the 21st century, some of these skills are effectiveness and contributions to a group project, learning from previous mistakes and experiences, and algorithmic thinking. This talk is about a toy designed by high school students for primary school students. The aim of Pomelo(the toy) is to enhance collaborative, experimental-leaning through physical interactions/games, and to help children understand the basics of algorithmic thinking. The talk also contains a comparison between Pomelo and pre-existing alternatives such as Scratch."
