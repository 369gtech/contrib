description: ".NET Summit 2020 Online Edition https://dotnetsummit.by - the 4th community driven .NET conference dedicated to practical experience of solving business challenges with .NET and technical challenges in .NET application\n\nRoberto Freato, 100 machines do 100s work in 1s [EN]\n\nThis session mixes many of the lesson learned in years while writing distributed software. First is \"design for failures\", to be sure our code will never generates inconsistencies. Second is \"stateless (almost) everywhere\", to be sure our compute power can be built in minutes. Third is \"performance\", which has to be considered a feature itself while it is often a competitive gap between you and others. In this session we approach the \"simple\" problem of reducing the computation time of a CPU intensive application, using C#, Queues, Azure Batch and a bit of shell scripting.\n\nGeneral Partner - ISsoft - https://issoft.by"
