Now we need the next step to reach another level of software releases. Now we want to test our business hypothesis. Two different approaches outstand in this area: smart routers and feature toggles. We'll have it covered. And lately we've hearing about Service Meshes: we'll do stateful dark launches too!\n\nCome to this session to see lots of demos and deployments with smart routers and feature toggles to check how effective A/B testing can be achieved. Of course A/B testing is nothing without monitoring, so we'll a monitoring platform setup and integrated for everything! You may be thinking about A/B, but after this session we'll get you from A to Z.\n#ABTesting #CanaryDeployments #FeatureToggles #SmartRouters #ContinuousDelivery\n\nPresented by Edson Yanaga\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DevoxxPL\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/grzegorz.duda.official/\n\nJoin us also here:\nTechnology Radar Review: https://dworld.pl/radar\nDevelopers World Academy: https://dworld.pl/akademia\nDevflix: https://devflix.pl\n\n#Devoxx #DevoxxPoland #IT #Development #SoftwareDevelopment"
