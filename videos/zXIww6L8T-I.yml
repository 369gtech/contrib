description: "Organizations face a need to identify many topics within huge amounts of unstructured documents. Oftentimes these topics do not occur frequently, so users face the need to find many different types of needles in one big haystack. Take for example interesting topics like “Drug Trafficking” or “Race Relations”; such topics are not very frequently mentioned in the news, but each occurrence of them could be important to a customer. In addition, these topics are complex, and it is hard to build a search query that would bring all relevant documents without too much noise. It is common wisdom to turn to Machine Learning (ML) solutions in such cases, but typical users don’t have the technical skills needed to build a ML solution on their own. On the other hand, data scientists often lack the domain expertise to create and evaluate such classifiers. Our Self-Service Classification solution is an interactive Do-It-Yourself tool that allows a user who is not a data scientist to train and deploy a classifier by herself. Several similar solutions have been suggested; they, however, typically require significant data collection efforts in order to create train & test sets, and these efforts might be a showstopper. Our solution, in distinction, provides a framework for creating a training set with minimal effort (a “labeling tool”), the ability to train an initial model very quickly, and the ability to improve an initial model via an interactive tuning phase. During the development of this tool we came to an understanding that reducing the data collection efforts is key, and built a workflow that simplifies the data collection process and requires much less work from the user. This process is built on the observation that we can identify ‘areas’ in the corpus of documents where the topic at hand is more prevalent. We help the user build and expand a query in order to retrieve highly relevant documents. After she labels an initial set of positive documents we identify keywords that enable us to define Triage terms to discard completely irrelevant documents. The result is that the user is required to tag a rather small set of positive documents, and we automatically identify the negative documents from an uploaded corpus of (unlabeled) production data. Our approach also offers model-tuning capabilities, which allow the user to intervene in the internal algorithmic steps, and customize them to her needs. This system enables domain experts to train a topic classifier in a couple of days. It is used in Thomson Reuters by several teams to expand TR Intelligent Tagging topic tagging capabilities.\n\nVisit the largest developer playground in Europe!\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/wearedevelopers\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/WeAreDevs\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/_wearedevelopers/\n\n#WeAreDevs"
