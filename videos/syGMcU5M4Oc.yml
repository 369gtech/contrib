description: "Brian Fanzo: Limitations Inspire Creativity\n\nChange is exciting, Change sucks, Change is rapid, Change is scary, Change is constant! To embrace this rapid pace of change, we must embrace a mindset that allows change and create strategies that redefines what success looks like. Snapchat content disappears after it’s viewed. Twitter is now blocking the ability to share the same tweet to multiple accounts, Facebook is changing almost daily around privacy and use of third party tools…. Many look at these changes as bad or as an excuse to stop using the platforms but for smart social marketers they look at these challenges as opportunities to create amazing possibilities. It’s time for business leaders, marketing managers and content creators to shift their mindset, embrace change and leverage these limitations to create new strategies and goals that redefine what success looks like - to the benefit of their communities.\n\nThe speech was given on 2018-05-23 at infoShare 2018 (Inspire Stage) in Gdańsk.\n\nMore info: http://infoshare.pl \nFollow us: https://facebook.com/infosharepl\nhttps://twitter.com/infosharepl\nhttps://instagram.com/infoshare/\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/1272775/\nhttps://plus.google.com/+infoshare/"
