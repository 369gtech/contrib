title: 'PKS Automation Station...All Aboard: Enabling Team Access to PKS with a Concourse Pipeline'
language: English
recordingDate: 1571259897
description: "Would you like the PKS cluster creation and PKS cluster user onboarding process to become automated with a Concourse pipeline? We'll demonstrate how to define your PKS cluster details as a single YAML file and provision your PKS clusters using the Concourse pipeline. In addition, we'll show how to automate granting the access to end users within an LDAP group so that end users can access their PKS cluster with only the Kubernetes command-line tool. We'll cover, in detail, how we utilized Vault to share the kubeconfig to PKS cluster users. We'll also share a templatized GitHub repo so anyone can try it on their own.\n\nLearn more: https://pv.tl/32ONZT6\n\nSpeakers: John Paice, Platform Reliability Engineer, DICK'S Sporting Goods; Vaseeharan Seevaratnam\nPlatform Reliability Engineer, DICK'S Sporting Goods\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2019\nSlideshare: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/pks-automation-stationall-aboard-enabling-team-access-to-pks-with-a-concourse-pipeline"
