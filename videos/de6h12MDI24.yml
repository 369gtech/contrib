title: 'Building a Self-Serve Stream Processing Platform with Flink'
recordingDate: 1603796407
description: 'Intuit''s Stream Processing Platform (SPP) allows any developer to easily build and manage stream processing applications. With SPP, a developer only needs to focus on developing their business logic and data transforms. They can then configure, orchestrate, and monitor their application through the SPP UI, while we take care of everything else under the hood. With a combination of open source technologies (Beam, Argo, Flink, Kubernetes), SPP is lowering the barrier to entry for operationalizing real-time use cases and making it such that "anyone can stream".'
