title: 'Benefits of Functional Programming beyond map/filter/reduce by Dierk König'
recordingDate: 1519313108
description: "Since Java 8 we have grown to exploit the benefits of Lambdas and Streams together with high-order functions to map, filter, and reduce our data. But this is only the beginning. With purely functional programming we can explore new territory where we can go safely parallel, ensure through the type system that we never call from the wrong thread, and expand our solution space with new mental tools. Any new trick that you learn this way is immediately applicable to a growing number of functional languages: Frege for the JVM, Elm and Purescript for the web, and Haskell and Idris for native code.\n\nDierk König, Canoo Engineering AG\nDierk König (Java Champion, JavaOne Rock Star) is professor for computer science and fellow at Canoo Engineering AG, Basel, Switzerland. He is a committer to many open-source projects including OpenDolphin, Frege, Groovy, Grails, GPars and GroovyFX.He is lead author of the \"Groovy in Action\" book, which is among the publisher's best-selling titles of the decade.\n\nRecorded at Jfokus 2018\nhttps://www.jfokus.se/jfokus18/schedule.jsp"
