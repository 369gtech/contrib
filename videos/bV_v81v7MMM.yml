description: "Should We Return to Python 2?\n[EuroPython 2021 - Talk - 2021-07-28 - Ni]\n[Online]\n\nBy Miroslav Šedivý\n\nMigration to Python 3 is over, but that's not the end of the journey. Although your code runs with the currently supported Python 3.6 to 3.9, there may be some pieces of code that look obvious to you, but may surprise younger developers who have never seen Python 2 code.\n\nA few months ago, I started looking for Python projects on GitHub and helped them to get rid of those Python 2 relics. I'll show you a few recipes beyond the automatic tools, how to make your code modern and prepared for future updates.\n\nAnd no, we should not return to Python 2. We should get rid of it completely.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2021.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/"
