description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nDiscussion & Comments: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2019\n—\nWhen we code, we often assume that the computer has an infinite amount of\nmemory. This is, of course, /very/ false. It is false for embedded\nprogramming, where memory is often limited to a few megabytes or even a few\nkilobytes, but it is also false for the most powerful workstations and\nservers. Using memory wisely makes your application possible on small\nsystems as well as prevents, or at least reduces, scaling problems for\nlarger applications. While some programming languages are designed to hide\nimplementation details from the programmer, C++ allows the programmer to\nspecify, with a good level of control, how memory is allocated, structured,\nand used. In this talk, we will explore what can be done at run-time with\nnegligible cost, what can be done at compile-time with meta-programming,\nand how we can thwart default compiler behavior to achieve memory-efficient\ntype-safe data representations. We will also extend the discussion to the\nhigher-level reorganization of data structures in order to make a better\nuse of memory.\n— \nSteven Pigeon\nUniversité du Québec à Rimouski\nAssociate Professor\nRimouski, Canada\n\nSTEVEN PIGEON (steven.pigeon@uqar.ca) is an associate professor of mathematics and computer science in the Department of Mathematics, computer science, and engineering at the Université du Québec à Rimouski. He received his PhD. from the Université de Montréal for his thesis on data compression in 2001. His post-doctoral studies were conducted at Western Ontario then McMaster universities during 2002 and 2003. From 2003 to 2005, he developed laser-based 3D range finding equipment for industrial applications in the private sector. He returned to academia in 2006 where he joined an ÉTS research team on video adaptation and transcoding. In 2011-2012, he joined the Ubisoft industrial chair on artificial intelligence as principal systems architect. Since 2012, he teaches mathematics and computer science at the Université du Québec à Rimouski, where he also chairs the Mathematics and Computer Science section. His current research interests are, in addition to data compression, machine-efficient implementations of algorithms and memory-efficient data structures.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
