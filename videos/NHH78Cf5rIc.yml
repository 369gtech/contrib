description: "Steven Hanley, Angus Lees, Hugh Blemings\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/120/\n\nLinux.conf.au has justifiably earned an enviable reputation in the Linux and broader FOSS community as being one of the most consistent and worthwhile conferences in the annual calendar.\r\n\r\nThis session will look under the hood at what makes LCA special and tease out some of the unique qualities that have served it so well (and in some cases not so well) over the years.\r\n\r\nWhile there will certainly be a fun “trip down memory lane” element to the session, the speakers will be focussing on the specific consistent nuts and bolts that make LCA work - much of it often invisible to those attending.\r\n\r\nThe three presenters have all had the good fortune to have not only attended CALU and all the LCAs since, but also between them to have been involved in their running in various capacities from conference director to speaker, Linux Australia representative to BoF leader.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
