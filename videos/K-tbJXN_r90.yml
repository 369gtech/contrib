title: 'Anti-Patterns in the Wild - Maarten Faddegon,  Pawe≈Ç Antemijczuk - EUC17'

recordingDate: 1499853011
description: 'Anti-patterns make code harder to understand for the human programmer and hence hide defects and make adding new functionality harder. However, little data exists on which anti-patterns occur in real-world software. This is a pity, because academic researchers cannot gauge which direction has most impact, and programmers have to re-evaluate which approach work best in practice.'
