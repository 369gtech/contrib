description: "( Java Training - https://www.edureka.co/java-j2ee-soa-training )\nThe purpose of a DTD is to define the legal building blocks of an XML document. DTD defines the document structure with a list of legal elements. A DTD can be declared inline in your XML document, or as an external reference. It also provides an application which is an independent way of sharing data. With a DTD, independent groups of people can agree to use a common DTD for interchanging data. We can use a standard DTD in our application to verify that data that you receive from the outside world is valid. We can also use a DTD to verify your own data.\nThis video gives a brief insight of XML DTD.\n\nHere are the related blogs:\nhttp://www.edureka.co/blog/understanding-java-hashmaps/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=xmldtd\nhttp://www.edureka.co/blog/methods-and-method-overloading-in-java/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=xmldtd\nhttp://www.edureka.co/blog/dynamic-data-allocation-in-java/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=xmldtd\n\nEdureka is a New Age e-learning platform that provides Instructor-Led Live, Online classes for learners who would prefer a hassle free and self paced learning \nenvironment, accessible from any part of the world.\nThe topics related to 'XML DTD' have extensively been covered in our 'JAVA/J2EE & SOA' course.\n\nFor more information, please write back to us at sales@edureka.co\nCall us at US: 1800 275 9730 (toll free) or India: +91-8880862004"
