Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nPlanning the Zero-Downtime Lifecycle of Your Service Mesh- Christian Posta, Solo.io\n\nA service mesh is a critical piece of application infrastructure that lives on the request path between your services. Once you get past the “hello world” for your particular mesh, you are left having to plan out your production deployment and more importantly, future upgrades. The architecture and patterns for deployment are as important (if not more?) as the specific mesh capabilities you choose. For example, patterns like separating ingress, running canaries, and focusing on limited configuration blast radius are foundational to enable zero-downtime upgrades of your mesh. In this talk, we discuss the vital patterns and practices cultivated working with mesh adopters around the world. The audience should come away with a core set of practices to enable successful lifecycle management of their service mesh."
