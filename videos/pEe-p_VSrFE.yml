description: "IoT has introduced many new opportunities in the areas of smarthomes, healthcare, automotive and logistics. So much so that the evolution of the technology has outpaced the much-needed governance and compliance to control false events and unwanted outcomes. As the IoT industry usage matures so does its need for applying integrity to the automation and machine driven decisions. The accuracy of real-time data streaming after applying transformations is paramount. False positives happen, and will continue to happen regardless of future technology. The ability to quickly diagnose a chain of decisions quickly can determine whether your company sinks or swims. Enfuse.io is building enterprise governance frameworks for application accountability. The solution allows Enfuse.io to provide verifications of thousands of machine driven decisions a second, mid-stream. These verifications are based off of a set of rules, actions and re-actions, largely known in Blockchain as smart-contracts. These contracts can guarantee that the action intended and initiated by a stream of data is validated before driving a potentially very important outcome. Corelogic is an Enfuse client which benefits from an immutable audit trail provided by blockchain through an easy to use software development kit which acts as a layer between the blockchain and Corelogic's data driven applications.\n\nSpeaker:\nCahlen Humphreys\nCo-founder, Enfuse\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
