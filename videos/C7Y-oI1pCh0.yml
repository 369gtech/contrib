description: '003 Ok, Ok, so when we write HTML to generate a tag with a class attribute, we can type a dot. followed by the value of the class attribute and press the TAB key. Emmet from Visual Studio Code will convert it into an HTML tag for us saving typing time. Another important aspect of following a tutorial is to instantly hit "Pause" and google a specific term from the video which is new to us or we don''t have enough information. We can also hide the explorer in Visual studio code by clicking on the first icon in the action bar. Super useful is "ALT + z" to toggle Word Wrap.'
