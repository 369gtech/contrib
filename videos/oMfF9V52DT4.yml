description: "Slides and more info: http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2016/michal-plachta\n\nAre you familiar with the following recipe?\n- First define an API and its documentation.\n- Then take the API and create its server implementation.\n- Then create a client for the same API, but in JavaScript land.\n- Then imperatively modify the browser’s DOM in order to allow user to do and see stuff.\n\nSounds about right?\n\nDuring this talk you will forget about all these things and become a functional web developer. I will show you how to write type-level web APIs, purely functional server and client implementations and how to render things without touching browser’s DOM.\n\nThe talk is divided into two parts: backend & frontend. The first part of the talk will introduce the concepts behind haskell-servant and we will implement a simple web app backend. Then we will code the app itself using Elm and reactive approach."
