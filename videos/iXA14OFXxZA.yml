description: "From Velocity Amsterdam 2015: A modern web application today is made up of 90 percent third-party code. We use third-party modules, platforms, domains, and more to get our applications running quickly and well. However, we often overlook the threat involved in running someone else’s code as though we wrote it ourselves. Each such piece of code may be malicious, compromised, or have vulnerabilities – and we’d be none the wiser.\n\nIn this demo we’ll introduce Snyk Stranger, a tool that helps you better track and control these security concerns easily and quickly.\n\nAbout Guy Podjarny (Snyk):\nGuy Podjarny (Guypo) the founder of Snyk.io, building web security tools for developers. Guy was previously CTO at Akamai and founder of Blaze.io. Guy’s research and writing focuses on web security and performance, often running large tests to reach data-driven conclusions. Guy is a frequent conference speaker, writes at guypo.com and Medium, is the author of Responsive & Fast (O’Reilly Media), and the creator of Mobitest.\n\nAbout Assaf Hefetz (Snyk):\nAssaf Hefetz is the co-founder of Snyk.io, building web security tools for developers.
