description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nGroupless Autoscaling with Karpenter - Ellis Tarn & Prateek Gogia, Amazon\n\nAutoscaling is a powerful technique to improve reliability and save costs. However, configuration of node autoscaling systems is a complex art. Karpenter is an open source, vendor neutral project that enables node autoscaling without the need for configuration and discovery for node groups in any cloud provider. With direct provider integration and out-of-the-box support for common node parameters like architecture, operating systems etc., taints, and labels, Karpenter gets users up and running quickly, while extending cleanly to more complex use cases.\n\nIn this session, we'll explore the history of autoscaling and our latest approach to low latency node autoscaling."
