title: 'Clojure and Android - Daniel Solano Gomez'
recordingDate: 1357585589
description: 'My ideas are naturally about Clojure and Android. The first is primarily about the technical challenges to making Clojure a first-class language for Android development and would appeal primarily to developers who are interested in hacking the language or are interested in lower-level language details. This talk would first start with some background on the Android platform and how it differs from a traditional Java stack. The next part would concentrate on how I got Clojure fully working, including dynamic compilation, on Android. I would then talk about how the change from 1.2 to 1.3 affected Clojure on Android and conclude with my thoughts on what barriers are left to making Clojure a first-class choice for Android development.'
