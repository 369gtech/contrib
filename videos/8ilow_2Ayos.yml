title: 'Making apps with React Native - Christian Brevik'
recordingDate: 1499244160
description: "As devices keep getting faster, people come to expect responsive and good-looking mobile apps. With React Native, you can make apps that feel completely native, but are written in JavaScript. That means you can leverage your skills as a web developer, while at the same time re-use pretty much all the code on several platforms.\n\nYou could write a native app, in a compiled language like Objective-C, C# or Java. But compiling code takes time. With React Native, you don't have to build the app to see changes. This accelerates the feedback loop, and you'll be much more productive.\n\nIn this talk, I'll introduce you to React Native and lessons learned from using it in production."
