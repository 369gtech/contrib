What's getting in their way isn't the technology - wrapping something in a docker container (usually) isn't that hard. Instead, it's the structures that have been put in place to manage risk and the relationships between teams that trip companies up. In this talk, I'll share some stories of customers struggling to get cloud native, and how we applied our methodology to turn things around. I'll cover the ideal team size, the ideal microservice size, what skills a team needs, the role of architects, how to know if something is ready to ship, and whose fault everything really is.\n\nHolly Cummins is the worldwide development discipline lead for the IBM Cloud Garage, and a developer in the London Cloud Garage.
