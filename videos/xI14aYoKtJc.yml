language: English
recordingDate: 1463984011
description: 'This session will explain how Java is evolved through the Java Community Process (JCP) program and how you can participate in that evolution as an individual, as a representative of your employer, or as a member of a non-profit organization such as a Java User Group. We will discuss the Adopt-a-JSR program and provide examples of the ways in which Java User Groups from all over the world have helped to define, to implement, and to test the Java EE 7 and Java SE 8 platforms. Java EE 8 and Java SE 9 are being developed now. You can help, and in the process you will have fun, learn new skills, and advance your career. Learn how to make the future Java!'
