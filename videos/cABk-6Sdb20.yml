description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\neBPF on the Rise - Getting Started - Quentin Monnet, Isovalent\n\neBPF is rising as an essential component for observability and networking programmability on Linux and in containers. Due to its performance, flexibility, and scalability, Liz Rice listed it as one of the five CNCF technologies to watch for 2021! In an opportunity to fully comprehend its potential, this introduction will help you get started with eBPF. First, the core architecture. What is an eBPF program? How to attach and run it safely in the kernel, and most importantly, what for? And what are the other components of the eBPF subsystem? Come and learn the basics. Then, augment your toolbox with utilities to manipulate eBPF objects. Inspect, debug or trace with bpftool, bcc tools, bpftrace, or libbpf and its Golang equivalent. Equipped with knowledge and tools, here you come, now prepared to instrument clusters with eBPF! Before you go load-balancing traffic and chasing metrics, the last part focuses on eBPF's benefits for cloud-native environments. Ready to surf the eBPF wave?"
