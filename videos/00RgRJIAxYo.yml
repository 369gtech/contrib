description: "Bringing the 'So What' to Big Data\n\nThe onset of the Big Data phenomenon has created a unique opportunity to improve the human condition, but the challenge ahead of us is to move beyond Big Data infrastructure to real, applied, and prioritized comprehension that is morally and practically useful. This requires redirecting our collective energies toward new algorithms, more distributed systems, and purer software architectures that more optimally exploit the infrastructure to answer questions of great social and personal value. Technologies that close the \"Understanding Gap\" can make great strides to prevent evil, reduce suffering, and create more actualized human potential. This pursuit is more than an opportunity- it is a key responsibility for the technology community today and through at least the next decade.\n\nhttp://strataconf.com/stratany2012/public/schedule/detail/26300"
