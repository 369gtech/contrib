description: "For more than a century the insurance business has been: evaluate risk, collect premiums, and pay claims. We had a lot of physical insurance agencies relying on paper documentation. The digital revolution has changed everything. \n\nWith machine learning and smart insurance we know the damages in advance and we can anticipate claims; with black boxes and IoT applications we can give support to our customers in real time. We sustain the collective intelligence of Generaliâ€™s people with hackathons and bootcamps and continuous learning. \n\nAbout: \nFabio Oggioni, Head of IT, Generali Italia\n\n Fabio has 20 years IT experience working for banks and insurance companies. He joined Generali Italia in 2014 and became Head of IT in 2017. In recent months he has been directing the IT Transformation program, focusing on the evolution of architectures and the introduction of new working practices. Besides working, he enjoys travelling, exploring and climbing. His passion for soccer is huge!"
