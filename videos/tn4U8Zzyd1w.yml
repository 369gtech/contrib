title: 'TheUXConf 2020 | A New Visual Interface for the City of Oslo | John Aurtande | Creuna'

description: "About the talk:\nOslo, Norway’s capital, is a modern and growing city, loved by its residents. It has 15 districts, 36 agencies, 53 000 employees, and countless projects and initiatives. But, with over 250 logos in use, this caused confusion and clutter. As a result, Oslo’s residents didn’t recognise much of the good work their municipal government actually did.\n\nThat’s why we created one logo and identity – to unite Oslo. The new identity adapts to the diversity of the city’s institutions and services. It creates a unified visual identity across all channels and is designed for use in two dimensions, three dimensions and motion.\n\nIn this talk I'll share our design process and challenges building the city's new identity that helps Oslo and its residents continue to connect and thrive together.\n\nAbout the speaker:\nJohn Aurtande – Brand Strategist at Creuna solving complex branding challenges.\n\nJohn has been leading several award-winning branding projects, including the rebranding of the City of Oslo. He has more than 15 years of experience as strategist, advisor and analyst.\n\nAbout the conference:\nDesign conference that’s not about buzzwords, but collaboration between designers. Our 5th User Experience design conference on March 2020 was themed around how UX, UI, content and graphic designers can work together better. \n\nWe've had insightful talks on day 1 and hands-on workshops on day 2 by speakers with experience working in Transport for London, OpenTable, The Paciello Group, Nike, Government Digital Service, Airbnb, Shopify, InVision, DuckDuckGo and others. From A/B Testing and Content Design to Design Language Systems and Ethical design.\n \nThe event was organised by The School of UX and kindly supported by SumUp and Sketch.
