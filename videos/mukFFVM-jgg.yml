description: "IAC (Infrastructure as code) has become a mainstay for teams looking to automate their infrastructure deployments however is it actually code or just text?\n\nMost cloud provider provisioning system or tools such as Terraform rely on a text based document to describe the infrastructure. Most of these approaches have had to shoehorn in some programming constructs (such as conditional logic and loops) into the languages to provide support for more complex scenarios.\nThis talk compares provisioning infrastructure using cloud provider approaches, Terraform and Pulumi.\n\nWith a combination of slides and code we'll see how solutions like Pulumi are providing real code based approaches for provisioning infrastructure and compare this to alternatives from cloud providers.\n\nAfter this talk attendees will have a better idea of the options available for provisioning infrastructure and why they may choose one approach over another.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks, courses, and conferences in the following links:\nhttps://ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndcdevops.com/"
