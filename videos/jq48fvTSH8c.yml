description: "Evelina is a Senior Research Data Scientist at The Alan Turing Institute,  the UKâ€™s national institute for data science and artificial  intelligence. She is passionate about making data science understandable  and accessible to everyone. She also does machine learning and F#  trainings and is a partner at FsharpWorks.\n\nAbout the session: \nMachine learning and artificial intelligence are becoming wide-spread and productionalized - you no longer need a mathematics PhD and months of software development time to implement and use a machine learning algorithm. You can treat them almost completely as black-boxes and use them directly in your applications! Not so fast - all the algorithms have some cases where they fail. In this talk, we will look at practical examples of such cases and explain what algorithms struggle in what areas and why. You will find out that although you don't need to understand all the math behind a machine learning algorithm, you should still be aware of how to use it effectively.\n\nwww.buildstuff.lt\nwww.buildstuff.es"
