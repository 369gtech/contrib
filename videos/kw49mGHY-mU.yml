language: English
recordingDate: 1521645068
description: "Microservices are popular: they are extremely focused and target a single action. You get the benefits: not tied to physical location, fewer deployment issues, faster development, language of choice, REST APIs, efficient data management, etc. But how do you minimize the downside? For example, achieving high performance and availability is not easy, latencies add up and security is paramount. In this session, we will show you how to maximize service levels and prevent threats and data loss from the most common bottlenecks and vulnerabilities by using ML. With ML, you can monitor performance, trace applications across multiple tiers, understand utilization of resources, troubleshoot problems rapidly and monitor for security threats.\n\nVijay Tatkar is Product Management Director for Oracle Management Cloud.
