language: English
recordingDate: 1623120165
description: "The dark market is full of cloned Point of Sales terminals and offers for fake merchant accounts. But how do they get there if every terminal is built to have anti-tampering mechanisms, segregated memory for private crypto keys, and multiple other layers of protection? In this talk, we follow the life cycle of the most popular PoS terminals of major vendors from their release onto the retail market through to breaking the device and cloning the terminal. We show you exactly what it takes for hackers to use PoS terminals to cash out.\n\n=== \n\nTimur Yunusov is a head of offensive security research and security expert in the area of payment security and application security.
