description: "f(by) 2020\nFP track\n\nLaTeX DSL for Kotlin - Vitaly Khudobakhshov @khudobakhshov\n\nAdoption of functional programming ideas, particularly lambdas, has changed software engineering enormously. Nowadays you can design your own embedded domain specific programming language in a very short period of time.\nMany languages like Haskell and Scala have a very suitable syntax to deal with embedded DSLs. Over the past few years Kotlin joined the family of DSL-friendly general-purpose programming languages with its own set of features, especially type-safe builders.\nn this talk I'd like to explore this very balanced Kotlin feature set with ultimate goal in my mind: to embed LaTeX-like DSL into Kotlin. I will dwell on Kotlin's pros and cons with respecting to this particular task.\n\nGeneral Partner - Evolution Gaming https://eng.evolutiongaming.com/"
