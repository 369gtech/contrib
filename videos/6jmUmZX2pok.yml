description: 'The problem that new technology doesn’t fix is unmaintainable code. Clean code with good tests is essential, but not enough. This talk introduces techniques like getting better at naming, explaining code with tests, the few code comments you actually need, README-driven development and writing Minimum Viable Documentation. After the excitement of adopting new technology and software craftsmanship comes the horror of your next software maintenance project. As Jean-Paul Sartre said*, ‘Hell is other people’s code’. Whatever your level, your future happiness depends on maintainable code.'
