title: 'DrupalCon Baltimore 2017: This Time, It’s Personalized: Preparing your site'
recordingDate: 1493195543
description: "Many sites are focused on two key goals: improved conversion and improved user experience. Web personalization has the potential to significantly increase performance on both.\n\nWith personalization, we can show a message in Mandarin to a visitor from China, for example, or remember a user’s previous visit and display an upcoming program more likely to be relevant to them. Evidence shows that this kind of personalization works -- some studies indicate average conversion increases of as much as 30%.\n\nYet despite a driving need for organizations to improve both conversion and usability, many groups are stuck, not knowing where to start, what processes need to be put into place, and what they need to prepare beforehand.\n\nIn this talk, we will discuss how to get started with personalization, including suggestions on incremental steps you can take to make web personalization a sustainable part of your team’s daily activity.\n\nWe will also discuss how personalization can be accomplished in Drupal. Finally, we’ll talk about the preparation you can do to ensure your personalization initiative will be successful, and how to get buy-in from internal stakeholders.\n\nNote: Some familarity with the concepts of personalization are useful, but no prior knowledge of the subject is assumed. We'll explain in plain language what personalization is and how it can be used."
