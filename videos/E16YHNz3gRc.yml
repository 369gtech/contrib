description: "Speaker: Eric Tracz\n\nRunning a business with a WordPress site is relatively easy. Tens of thousands of plugins out there do help a lot, but sometimes it’s hard to find a perfectly tailored solution. Often, you do end up developing custom code for your site. Consider putting a bit extra effort and convert that custom solution into a sellable product. That can not only cover the cost of initial development and maintenance but also present another revenue stream.\n\nAbout the speaker\n\nI’m a Digital Nomad currently living in Kuala Lumpur. Co-Founder and CEO of PeepSo.com and TwistPress.com. I began my journey with Open Source about a decade ago and never regretted it. I care about creating beautiful and useful solutions for WordPress. What’s more important, solutions which are also fully supported by the very people creating them.\n\nAfter years of hard work, I’m finally in a place where I can have myself and the company give back to the WordPress community by sponsoring WordCamps and sharing my knowledge and experience.\n\nEvent Page: https://2019.singapore.wordcamp.org/sessions/#wcorg-session-1114\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/qmSm/"
