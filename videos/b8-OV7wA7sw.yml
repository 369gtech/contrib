description: "(Recorded at Jfokus 2016. http://www.jfokus.com)\n\nFrege: purely functional programming for the JVM\n\nFrege is a Haskell for the JVM. It is the only purely functional JVM language and has a lot of interesting features in that regard. Most of all, it interoperates with Java in a very special manner that doesn't try to mix but combines with the object-oriented world without sacrificing any of its language guarantees in terms of purity. Pure functions cannot possibly have mutable state or any other side effects and are thus the ultimate tool for concurrent and parallel programming. If you ever wanted to see how functional programming looks in its pure form, this session is for you.\n\nDierk König, Canoo Engineering AG\n\nDierk König (JavaOne Rock Star) works as a fellow for Canoo Engineering AG, Basel, Switzerland. He is a committer to many open-source projects including OpenDolphin, Frege, Groovy, Grails, GPars and GroovyFX.He is lead author of the \"Groovy in Action\" book, which is among the publisher's best-selling titles of the decade."
