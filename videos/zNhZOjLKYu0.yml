description: 'When the team is shifting to product development style, leader (or manager) faces typical problems. And for many years of building and transforming teams, each leader compose sets or frameworks of practices that allow him to succeed. I want to talk about typical problems and practices of their solutions: about product mindset and design thinking, about mentality and legacy, about evolution or revolution of development processes, about architecture and refactoring, about testing and delivery, coding and support. With each of these areas the leader lives every day in “cheek to cheek” mode and solving transformation problems. Hope my experience will helpful for you.'
