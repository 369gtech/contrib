description: "After mastering python basics, it gets increasingly difficult to produce well-structured and test-driven code. Code that is fit for purpose in the short term could become stale due to a lack of composability and testing. In this tutorial, we will go beyond a typical modeling notebook and turn it into well-structured python code equipped with tests that are easy to understand, maintain and extend.\n\nWhether developing new models in Jupyter Notebooks or porting existing code from older infrastructure or other technologies (e.g. Excel, SAS), data scientists are often faced with disorganized structure, reproducibility issues or low run-time performance. Model implementation quality and performance plays a critical role in successful deployment, continued use and future maintenance costs. Key drivers of this success include modularized code and tests that are well defined, both of which often get neglected or left out entirely. In this tutorial we will start with a Jupyter Notebook that represents a sample model with typical shortcomings, such as a mixing of input data processing with model logic, missing tests, lack of usage examples or confusing code.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
