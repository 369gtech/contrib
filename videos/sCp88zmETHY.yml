description: "Esmée Babet Snoey Kiewit is 24 years old and a CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker). She works as an information security consultant at Securesult in the Netherlands. So on a daily basis she advices companies about their security strategy and status, and she performs privacy and security tests (pen tests). Esmée holds a background in international relations and is nicknamed by her colleagues as 'the High Heeled Hacker'.\n\nThe new European-wide privacy legislation: General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is coming at us at the speed of light and only 3% companies are ready for it yet. In this Ignite I will tell how we help companies with their privacy protection and how we go about technical privacy testing.\n\nPrivacy and information security are important to all of us. In order to prevent data breaches, we conduct security tests. In order to protect data subjects and get ready for the new European-wide data protection regulation (GDPR), we conduct technical privacy tests. In this ignite you will get a brief overview of the most important steps while performing a technical privacy assessment and get a better understanding of how we contribute to protecting your data."
