description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nDiscussion & Comments: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2019\n—\nThis session will provide an introduction to pmr::test_resource, which supports testing memory allocation related behavior on a per-object basis. pmr::test_resource is a C++17 memory resource designed for testing that can be plugged into any test framework. It is the modernized version of the\_bslma::TestAllocator\_used in production for over two decades at Bloomberg, where it has helped to expose a variety of bugs, such as memory leaks, overruns, multiple deletes, exception-safety guarantee failures etc.\n\nThis presentation will show the use of test_resource in detecting errors related to memory allocation. We walk through code to demonstrate several bugs and show how they misbehave, how we diagnose them, and a reasonable fix. pmr::test_resource is being proposed for the Library Fundamentals 3 TS and full source code for test_resource,\_bslma::TestAllocator\_and the examples is available on GitHub.\n— \nAttila Fehér\nSenior software engineer, Bloomberg LP\nWorking with C++. Original proposer of the C++11 alignment features.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
