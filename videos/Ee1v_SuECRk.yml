title: 'Rob Conery - Rethinking NoSQL: Four and a Half Reasons Why RethinkDB Is Worth a Look'
language: English
recordingDate: 1443688953
description: 'NoSQL/Document databases have changed the way we build things - whether you like it or not. Even if you’re a diehard relational person - you’ve been touched by their impact. Many people dislike these NoSQL systems and their casual approach to writing data “eventually” as well as their quirky administration. RethinkDB is trying to change this. Safe writes by default, a simple, straightforward administration scheme, and a functional query language - RethinkDB is redefining NoSQL, in a good way. In this talk Rob Conery will show you the most compelling features of RethinkDB 2.0, and why it deserves consideration for your next project.'
