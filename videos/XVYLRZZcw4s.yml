description: "Click on SHOW MORE for video highlights! In our first session of the new year we welcome Daniel Semler, CMTS and lead developer for the Memory Guard functionality in the Autonomous Health Framework that integrates with RAC Database Services to prevent node evictions. \n\n02:45 - What is Oracle’s goal in developing Memory Guard?\n04:00 - How can memory stress cause a node eviction?\n05:30 - How does Memory Guard detect memory stress? \n06:20 - What does Memory Guard specifically do when stress is detected?\n08:06 - You mentioned database services. What are these?\n09:41 - Are there specific service parameters that I need to configure to make optimal use of Memory Guard?\n11:42 - What happens if my services are running only on one instance?\n13:02 - If I have a mixture of singleton and multi-instance services does Memory Guard shut down the later ones first? \n14:40 - Does Memory Guard only work with RAC Databases or can it protect nodes running SI databases as well?\n15:41 - That happens if I have RAC and SI DB instances on the same node? \n16:18 - How do I enable Memory Guard?\n16:45 - Can I disable Memory Guard, for example during patching and upgrades?\n17:50 - How do I know if Memory Guard is enabled and working?\n19:35 - Linux already has the OOM (Out of Memory) killer to identify memory stress on nodes. How does Memory guard work in conjunction with that?\n21:46 - How do I know a service was shut down by Memory Guard?\n23:30 - Can I get a notification when Memory Guard takes action or do I need to always check the logs?\n24:18 - Are these notifications available in Enterprise Manager and if so from which version?\n25:09 - Does the application tier need to be configured specifically for Memory Guard?\n27:18 - Do I need to use Application Continuity to reliably recover when a service is shut down by Memory Guard? \n28:48 - What if the FreeMem metrics keeps on decreasing, but from a Database standpoint it is confirmed that the processes consuming memory are *not* Oracle     process (SGA or PGA). What action would Memory Guard take here?\n31:43 - Does Memory Guard cause a stopped singleton service to be started on another instance? \n32:52 - How does Memory Guard’s stopping of services interact with Global Data Services?\n34:10 - How does Memory Guard’s stopping of services interact with Active Data Guard?\n35:40 - What is the overhead of Memory Guard?\n38:04 - If I am not using the GIMR (MGMTDB), will memory Guard still work?\n39:13 - Does Memory guard understand EXADATA architecture where for example, again Oracle processes )SGA/PGA), is not the memory contributor but rather RDS (Reliable Datagram Sockets)/Infiniband as an example is known to consume memory?\n40:43 - Do I need a special license to make use of Memory Guard? \n41:20 - Can I customize any settings such as memory threshold?\n43:10 - Can Memory Guard’s actions cause a cascade failure due to causing greater load on remaining nodes?\n47:00 - We have Machine Learning models being applied for components like CHA, HM etc, do we have any ML models being applied for Memory Guard?\n49:00 - Would Memory Guard provide any notifications for Autonomous databases so that customer can be notified accordingly so that he can scale up resources?? \n\nMark Scardina, Director of Product Management - Oracle Autonomous Health\nDaniel Semler, Consulting Member of Technical Staff - Applied Machine Learning Technology"
