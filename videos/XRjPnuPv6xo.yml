description: 'What would it be like to learn Clojure as the first programming language? Many of us will never know, but this talk might be a close substitute. It is a report of running a new Clojure programming course integrated into the Liberal Arts curriculum. Deep inside rural Japan, in the 2017 Spring semester, fourteen students finished the course, therefore it will be offered again next winter. Interestingly, closely observing the students’ struggle for understanding the language reorganizes the instructor’s thinking about programming as well.'
