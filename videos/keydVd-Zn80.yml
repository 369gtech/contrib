title: 'GopherCon 2018: George Tankersley - Micro optimizing Go Code'
language: English
recordingDate: 1536679105
description: "Everyone knows: if you need to go fast, bust out the assembly. But what if thereâ€™s better performance to be had just by writing Go more carefully?\n\nIn this tutorial session, George will optimize a hash function in pure Go, starting from a direct implementation of the RFC and going until he beats the standard library. This will cover the whole process - starting with the naive code and a set of tests, then progressing through some algorithmic improvements and down the rabbit hole of program tuning. Along the way you'll see the performance impact of API design, some microbenchmarking pitfalls, an introduction to profiling, and a lot of practical tips for doing this kind of optimization.\n\n\nWhen the hash function runs out, George will draw further examples from the standard libraries (mostly crypto!) and other high performance Go projects."
