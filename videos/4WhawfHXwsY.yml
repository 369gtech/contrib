description: "The talk from .NET Fest conference in Kyiv, Ukraine.\nPresentation: http://bit.ly/34fFb9q\nFb: https://www.facebook.com/dotNETFest/\nWebsite: http://dotnetfest.com/\n\n\nYou must have noticed how Docker and containers is playing a more and more important part in .NET development. Docker support is everywhere, so it should be easy to build solutions based on container technology, right? But, it takes a bit more to architect and create a .NET solution that use Docker at its core. Many questions arise: How do you design a solution architecture that fits well with containers? Would I use .NET or .NET Core? What is a proper way to migrate to such an architecture? What changes in the .NET implementation from pre-Docker solutions with micro-services? Where do container orchestrators fit in and how do I build and deploy my solutions on a Docker container cluster, such as Azure Kubernetes Service?\nThese and many other questions will be answered in this session. You will learn how to design and architect your .NET solutions and get a flying start to create, build and run Docker-based containerized applications."
