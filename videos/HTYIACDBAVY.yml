description: "Make More of the Sky - Air Traffic Management (ATM) services affect the quality and performance of every commercial flight in the world - currently transporting about a billion passengers a year. Growing traffic, limited systems capacity, strict safety requirements, and high environmental awareness demand a constant ATM services improvement. \r\nCome and listen to Heiko Udluft, AirSense Technical Leader, Jesse Anderson, BigData guru, and Vincent Chartier, Customer Success CTO at Microsoft France, tell how they use Azure to continuously develop, deploy and release AirSense services, the Airbus new generation ATM services. These services, powered by Azure Data & Analytics platform, provide business insights based on real-time aircraft position data to Airbus internal and external customers in order to shape the future of ATM.\r\nFind out how EventHub, CosmosDB and Databricks, amongst others, were combined to handle real-time streams, derive analytics, and provide decision support directly relevant and valuable for the Air Transportation industry. Heiko, Jesse and Vincent will also cover the collaborative approach they leverage to overcome the challenges encountered along the way."
