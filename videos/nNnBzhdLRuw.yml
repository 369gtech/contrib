description: "Erlang User Conference 2013\nMore info and slides on the website: http://www.erlang-factory.com/conference/ErlangUserConference2013/talks ]\n\n\nAll \"systems\" need to be managed, typically using some \"manager\" software speaking some protocol to the system being managed. In this talk I'll be providing some opinions on management software written in Erlang.\n\nErlang has been around for quite some time, and over the years a plethora of various protocol implementations have accumulated, both on the server (agent) side and also on the client (manager) side. In the early days we saw ASN.1 and SNMP, and these days all the rage is about NETCONF/YANG and Openflow.\n\nI will discuss some of these protocols and provide guidance on when to use which protocol. History repeats itself and new and hyped is not necessarily better than old proven and bug free."
