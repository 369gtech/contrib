description: "Erlang Factory SF Bay Area 2013\nMore info and slides on the website: http://www.erlang-factory.com/conference/SFBay2013/talks\n\nElixir is a programming language for the Erlang VM. Elixir provides a first class macro mechanism, supports polymorphism via protocols (similar to Clojure's) and many other features while keeping the functional aspects of Erlang used to build distributed, fault-tolerant applications.\n\nIn this talk, José Valim will introduce Elixir and showcase some of its features, going into details about how they can be a useful part of developer's daily tools."
