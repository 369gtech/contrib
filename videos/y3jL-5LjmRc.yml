title: 'Taking it to the Nest Level - Nested KVM on the POWER9 Processor'
recordingDate: 1548381850
description: "Suraj Jitindar Singh\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/145/\n\nNested virtualisation is the idea of running a virtual machine within another\r\nvirtual machine. The new IBM POWER9 PowerPC processor has increased hardware\r\nsupport for nested virtualisation and Suraj has been in the process of\r\ndeveloping software support for this feature. In this talk he will delve\r\ninto the rational behind developing this, the implementation details including\r\nthe changes involved to KVM and qemu to support this feature, the challenges\r\nfaced, and finally a discussion about the current state of the project and \r\nfuture work still to be completed. Suraj will also attempt to answer the \r\nquestion on everybody's lips \"but how deep can you nest?\"\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
