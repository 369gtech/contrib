description: "\"This talk introduces machine learning through the lens of three use cases:\n\nTeaching a computer sign language (supervised learning)\nPredicting energy usage in Texas (time series data)\nUsing machine learning to find your next job (content-based filtering)\nEach use case demonstrates techniques applicable in real-world machine learning problems.\"\n\nMachine learning can feel like a magic black box. Learn the math behind the magic in this beginner-friendly talk. Attendees will walk away knowing what the different kinds of machine learning are, how to use the PyData stack to apply them, and how to approach problems commonly encountered when practicing machine learning in the real world.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
