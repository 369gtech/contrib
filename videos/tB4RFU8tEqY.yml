title: 'Effective IDE(A) (Anton Arhipov)'
recordingDate: 1543246827
description: "Modern IDEs are quite complex. Even IDE developers say that they sometimes discover new features only while reading the IDE’s code. And does this sound familiar: your colleague is trying to find a class in the project tree, and he doesn’t remember the name of the class, and so you are trying hard to scream:“Just press Ctrl+Shift+E!!!“\nGenerally, developers just use IDE and so often do not utilize the power of automated refactorings, shortcuts, fast navigation, and other awesome features that IDEs provide.\nThe audience will learn a lot of tips and tricks, and a lot of different shortcuts will be also covered"
