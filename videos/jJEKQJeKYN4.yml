description: "This video was recorded at Code Mesh LDN 19 - http://bit.ly/37xc3Nr\n\nGet involved in Code Sync's next conference - http://bit.ly/2Mcm4aS\n\n---\n\nYOUR BRAIN ON SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT\nby Fahran Wallace\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nPsychology\nSoftware Delivery \nCognitive Bias\n\nTALK LEVEL: Beginner\n\nABSTRACT\nThe brain encounters more complexity than it can possibly deal with in life, and it's evolved a rich set of heuristics to deal with the problem. Those heuristics are fantastically tuned for staying fed, not getting eaten by bears etc., but are they well-suited for designing software?\n\nThis talk is for software engineers and architects alike, who are curious about how they make decisions, and how they think. It's threaded together from stories, personal experiences and otherwise, of systems that ended up a very strange shape, or were killed altogether, not through bad coding, but through humans collectively optimising for the wrong thing.\n\nLearn about the biases that affect our programming choices; how we favour the first solution we think of (Anchoring effect), are suspicious of things that were “Not Invented Here”, and just how difficult it is to change your worldview (the Backfire effect).\n\nYour Brain on Software Development is a whimsical talk that explores the intersection of Programming, Architecture and Psychology, through the medium of funny-in-retrospect memories, borrowed war stories, and attempts to avoid people swearing at my design choices 5 years later.\n\nSlides & full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/fahran-wallace/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - FAHRAN WALLACE\nA wildly enthusiastic engineer at OpenCredo\n\nFahran Wallace is a Senior Consultant at OpenCredo. She’s been programming professionally for 8 years, and her current focus is Data Engineering. She finds the intersection of people and software to be a constant source of fun and adventure. Building things, and absorbing the stories of others, are her two favourite ways to learn.\n\nMore on Fahran Wallace: https://codesync.global/speaker/fahran-wallace/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE MESH LDN 19\nCode Mesh LDN is powered by Code Sync.
