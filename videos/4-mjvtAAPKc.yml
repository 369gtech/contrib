language: English
recordingDate: 1517274000
description: "Open Source sells itself as being about technical problems—delightfully thorny technical problems, at that. However, successful projects are filled with people, which introduces a whole different set of problems that programmers often have not developed the skills to handle.\n\nKatrina is an ecosystem engineer at GitHub. She accidentally became a\ndeveloper while pursuing a degree in molecular biology. When\nprogramming, her focus is on automation, workflow optimization, and\nrefactoring. She works primarily in Go and Ruby, contributes to\nseveral open source projects, and is the creator of exercism.io, a\nplatform for code practice and programming mentorship.\n\n\nFor more on YOW! conferences, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
