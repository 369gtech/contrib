language: English
recordingDate: 1618957651
description: "One of the holy grails of responsive web layouts is the “Masonry” grid commonly used on Pinterest and many other sites.

However, this design pinnacle still stands strong as a challenge to frontend engineers, often requiring a mess of complex JavaScript to manipulate the DOM successfully. Now, there’s a light at the end of the tunnel!
