description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nConnecting with Prometheus World: Logs and Metrics - Eduardo Silva, Calyptia\n\nFrom a data collection standpoint, Logs and Metrics were always handled separately: different sources were handled by different \"agents\". Systems administrators for years have asked for a unified experience where both, Logs and Metrics, were collected, pre-processed, and shipped from a single agent. In the Logging space, Fluentd and Fluent Bit projects are one of the preferred choices, and surprisedly our users have asked that we integrate native Metrics handling, and today this has been implemented. As the Fluent project, we evaluated not only how to collect metrics, but also how to provide smooth integration with the defacto industry standards. We decided to launch our first Metrics support by fully integrating with OpenMetrics and Prometheus. In this presentation, you will learn about the integration, best practices for Metrics collection with Fluent, and how to leverage our Node Exporter, Prometheus Exporter and Remote Write implementations with your current Prometheus services and tooling without any disruptive change. In the Fluent project, we believe in lowering the friction for our users and integrating with their current standard services. These are interesting times where Prometheus and Fluentd are finally in sync."
