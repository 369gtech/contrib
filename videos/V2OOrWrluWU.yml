title: 'Changing The Game: Leveraging Game Theory to Transform Your IT Organization (Kevin Crawley, US) [EN]'
recordingDate: 1577301660
description: "As organizations begin the process of digitally transforming they will often struggle after initial efforts at automation (the dreaded J-curve). In this session we’ll discuss why the J-curve phenomenon occurs and define the concept behind the Pareto Inefficient Nash Equilibrium through a game show called “Golden Balls”. In this entertaining segment we’ll discuss how you can introduce this concept to effectively change the game and push past the low-end of the J-curve.\n\nThe journey doesn’t end there, as organizations begin shipping changes more often, introducing new features, services, and dependencies complexity begins to rise. This often results in teams forming centers of excellence around reliability and availability. We will talk about how Site Reliability Engineers enable organizations by accelerating into the upper end of the J-curve through leveraging observability to effectively establish error budgets, SLOs and SLIs. We’ll discuss how SRE teams can leverage distributed tracing aggregates, system metrics, and log analytics to effectively measure “all the things” and the value this measurement brings to engineering teams through visibility, communication, and accountability."
