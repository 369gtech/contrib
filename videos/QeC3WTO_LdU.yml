title: 'Modernizing Traditional Applications: From PoC to Production'
language: English
recordingDate: 1509732025
description: 'A proof of concept is a great way to see if your traditional applications are worth Dockerizing. However, getting that first application into production in an enterprise can pose many challenges, both technical and organizational. In this talk, I will take you through the journey starting with high-level decisions such as what applications and components to Dockerize and methodology, then move on to more detailed decisions such as what components to put in images, configuration management, and version control. I will also cover how this impacts the development pipeline and strategies for operationalizing and scaling out the application onboarding process.'
