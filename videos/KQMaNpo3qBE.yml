title: 'Cameron Davidson Pilon - A crash-update to lifelines | PyData Global 2020'
language: English
recordingDate: 1609873316
description: "Talk \n\nlifelines, the popular Python survival analysis library, has come a long way since its release in 2013, and development has accelerated these past two years. In this crash-update, I will demonstrate some of the newest features of lifelines in the past two years, our philosophy of “make the current best practice easy”, and what’s to come in lifelines as we plan our first 1.x release.\n\nSpeaker\nCameron Davidson-Pilon has worked in many areas of applied statistics, from the evolutionary dynamics of genes to modelling of financial prices. His contributions to the community include lifelines, an implementation of survival analysis in Python, lifetimes, and Bayesian Methods for Hackers, an open source book & printed book on Bayesian analysis. Formally director of data science at Shopify, Cameron is now applying data science to the alt-protein space.\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
