title: 'API First or Events First: Is it a Binary Choice?'

description: "\"When do you use API-first or events-first architecture? Is this a binary choice? This is a false dichotomy! A mental model is needed to frame the architecture, packaging, and programming choices for modern applications.\n\nVarying degrees of combination of events and APIs can be used to design a system. Event notifications-based systems require an API callback to the source. CQRS and event-sourcing patterns, on the other hand, are on the complex end of the event-driven spectrum. APIs also have a maturity model, evolving with the adoption of reactive paradigms. \n\nIn this session, weâ€™ll look at heuristics such as cost, latency, security, and external integrations that will influence implementation. Architects will learn actionable fitness functions to strike a balance between APIs and events to build sustainable architectures.\"\n\nMadhav Sathe, Sr Platform Architect at VMware; Rohit Kelapure, Principal Solution Architect at VMware\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/api-first-or-events-first-is-it-a-binary-choice-238456715"
