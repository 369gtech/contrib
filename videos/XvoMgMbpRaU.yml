description: "Slides: http://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/platforms-as-contracts-64888820\n\nPlatforms like Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) can be viewed as contracts between applications and the people who build, operate, and deploy them. At the root of these contracts is a core premise: if your application checks off a few boxes, the platform can provide enormous amounts of power and enable capabilities that wouldn't otherwise be possible.\n\nIn this talk, I'll argue that every platform makes a contract to this effect (sometimes implicitly, especially in the case of proprietary in-house platforms). We'll examine the ways in which these contracts manifest themselves in different platforms, the kinds of contracts that exist in PCF, and how to assess whether a given platform makes a good tradeoff.\n\nSpeaker: John Feminella; Advisory Engineer, Pivotal."
