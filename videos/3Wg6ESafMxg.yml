description: "Talk \nSmall Big Data is a grey area in data science between “it fits in memory” and 100 Tb. Some of the tools used for big data are overkill, and they might require a particular set of expertise that not every organization has. In contrast, many of the libraries and paradigms used for small data can become expensive when deploying to the cloud. How can we process large-ish data fast and efficiently?\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
