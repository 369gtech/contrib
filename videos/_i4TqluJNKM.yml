title: 'YOW! Lambda Jam 2015 Rowan Davies & Stephan Hoermann - Using Relative Monads for Cheap Syntax'
recordingDate: 1514643597
description: "We will walk through a production use of this at CBA (converted to Haskell), which has allowed us to cheaply add error handling to new monads and the theory behind it. Finally, we will compare this approach with monad transformers and monad layers.\n\nIn this talk we will present a technique based on relative monads that allows one to embed generic syntax involving a monad, m, which can then be simply reused for any relative monad, relative to m.\n\nI am a software engineer and functional programming mentor in Omnia, the Commonwealth Bank advanced analytics and big data project. Previously I was a lecturer and researcher in computer science at the University of Western Australia 2001-2014, and a computer science PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University 1993-2001 supervised by Frank Pfenning. My research focuses on programming and languages, using concepts from logic and type theory. Some of my notable research contributions to functional programming and languages include a derivation of monadic types from a constructive interpretation of modal logic, and the first practical implementation of refinement types.\n\nStephan is tech lead for the big data ETL tooling team at Commonwealth Bank, bringing functional programming and open source to ETL.He discovered his passion for functional programming and static typing after writing a distributed mass binary analysis framework in Python.\n\nFor more on YOW!
