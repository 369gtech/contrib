description: 'We instrumented 15k LOC codebase with spec so you don''t have to (but probably should). Validation; testing; destructuring; composable "data macros" via conformers; we''ve tried spec in all its multifaceted glory. This talk is a distillation of lessons learned interspersed with musing on how spec alters development flow and one''s thinking.'
