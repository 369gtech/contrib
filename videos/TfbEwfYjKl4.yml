title: 'Learn how to scale your applications with Google Compute Engine (100 Days of Google Dev)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1441309210
description: "Google Compute Engine offers automatic scaling and load balancing so that your applications can easily respond and handle increases or decreases in traffic. This is the same technology used by Google, and its powerful features are now available to Google Compute Engine users. This video describes both autoscaling and load balancing, sets up a common scenario, and lastly, demonstrates how to use each service.\n\nAt some point in your application development, you will start to think about scaling your application so that it can respond quickly and appropriately to your customer requests, without overloading your virtual machine instances. Use load balancing so that you can distribute traffic to your application among groups of virtual machines, optimizing for network, region, or content-based load balancing. Set up autoscaling so that Compute Engine monitors traffic to your application and can make logical decisions to add or remove instances from your cluster, so that you can respond to heavy traffic, or reduce costs in times of lower traffic. Use the two features together to create a truly scalable solution.\n\nFor more information about autoscaling, visit the Scaling Group of Instances: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/autoscaler/\n\nFor more information about load balancing, visit the Compute Engine Load Balancing: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/\n\n100 Days of Google Dev / 100 developer videos over 100 days / #GoogleDev100 \n\nSubscribe to the Google Developers channel at http://goo.gl/mQyv5L"
