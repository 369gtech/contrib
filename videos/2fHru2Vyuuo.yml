description: "Document Redaction with LibreOffice Preventing Leakage of Sensitive Information by Redaction in Collaborative Environments\nby Muhammet Kara\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/UD2.119/collab_drwl.webm\n\n\nRedaction in its sanitization sense (as distinguished from its other editing sense) is the blacking out or deletion of text in a document, or the result of such an effort. It is intended to allow the selective disclosure of information in a document while keeping other parts of the document secret. Typically the result is a document that is suitable for publication or for dissemination to others than the intended audience of the original document. For example, when a document is subpoenaed in a court case, information not specifically relevant to the case at hand is often redacted. Another example is patient information of hospitals, which is distributed to be used for research purposes. \n\nA new document redaction feature for Collabora Office is being developed, and it will also be available on the next major version of LibreOffice. This new feature will provide a much more efficient means than the traditional print-redact-scan process, and will try to prevent also the accidental leakage of redacted information by completely removing them in the resulting PDF document, rather than just hiding. \n\nRoom: UD2.119\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 18:45:00+01"
