Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nIntro to Kubernetes Sig-Architecture Subprojects - Davanum Srinivas, VMware & Jordan Liggitt, Google \n\nSIG Architecture maintains and evolves the design principles of Kubernetes, and provides a consistent body of expertise necessary to ensure architectural consistency over time. The SIG takes care of evolution of Conformance definitions, API definitions/conventions, Deprecation Policy, Design principles, etc. To support these activities the SIG participants work on multiple subprojects.   They are as follows:   * Architecture and API governance - is largely oriented towards sub-project maintainers.  * Code organization - is oriented towards maintainers and distributions.  * Conformance - is oriented towards distributions and community/ISV ecosystems solutions.  * Production readiness - is oriented towards distributions, support organizations, and users.   In this talk, we will walk through what each of the subprojects does, how they work, how each of them benefit and influence work in the kubernetes community, and how you can get involved. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UajO"
