description: "Mobile technologies are evolving, client's needs change over time, but what about your application's architecture? \nHow can an architecture crafted 3 to 5 years ago be renewed, improved and changed on the go in order to fully meet the client's demands and to use the latest features that the SDK offer? In this session we will discuss about a case study involving the largest financial mobile application currently being developed here in Turin and how we are going through the migration from an \"old\" MVP ark to a much more modern MVVM model. \n\nWe will cover aspects such as Android Ark Components, EventBus, and much more."
