description: "Speakers:\nMichael Girma - GliHub - on hyperlocal learning solutions - from Ethiopia pilot to anywhere\nScott Klemer - UCSD - on designing a world where people teach themselves and each other\n\nSolve for X (www.solveforx.com) is a community of people working to accelerate progress on technology moonshots -- radical technology ideas for solving global problems. Radical in the sense that the solutions could help millions (or billions) of people; that the audacity of the proposals makes them sound like science fiction; and that there is some real breakthrough or new approach that makes us believe these ideas could be brought to life. We meet in-person and online. \n\nSolve for X is an open platform powered by Google [x] and many partners and friends\n\nWatch all Google I/O 2014 videos at: g.co/io14videos"
