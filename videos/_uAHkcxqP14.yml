description: "You've been given a design which is going to require a complex dropdown menu. You would've liked to save time and use a select tag but it's missing some features. Do you use a component library or do you courageously build your own component? We'll look into why the DIY route, no matter how challenging, is almost always the right choice. We'll also look into how to plan and build all the crucial features (UX, keyboard handling, styling, accessibility, testing, etc) in a reusable way.\n\nSlides: https://speakerdeck.com/julienben/diy-components-why-and-how\n\nYGLF 2019: Code Camp Blog - Julien Benchetrit:\nhttps://www.israel.yglfconf.com/post/meet-the-speaker-julien-benchetrit"
