language: English
recordingDate: 1563562530
description: "Julius Plenz, Google\n\nWhen running large scale systems, we strive to deliver both low tail latency and high utilization of servers. However, these two dimenions are at odds: increasing the average utilization of a system will have a detrimental impact on the tail latency.\n\nThis talk provides a light-weight walkthrough of the important basics of queueing theory (avoiding unnecessary formalism), illustrates graphically several typical outcomes of this analysis, and closes with a few basic rules on how to think about utilization and tail latency.\n\nView the full SREcon19 Asia/Pacific program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon19asia/program\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
