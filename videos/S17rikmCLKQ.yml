title: '#FOSSBack Keith Bergelt - OS Technical and Patent Collaboration in Parallel & Patent Risk Mitigation'
recordingDate: 1614611117
description: "Given the nature of collaborative development of Open Source Software (OSS) in projects, projects must ensure that technical development occurs along with legal cooperation between developers and users.  Participation in technology development through OSS requires that we look to community solutions for patent risk mitigation.\n\n\nParticipants will be introduced to the Open Invention Network and develop an understanding of the organization’s mission, free membership, community initiatives, and support of OSS innovation through projects.\n\n\n###########\n\nFollow us on Social Media and join the Community!\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Fossbckstg\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/groups/8653059/​\n\nFOSS Backstage is an event by Plain Schwarz – https://plainschwarz.com"
