Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nKubeVirt Intro: Virtual Machine Management on Kubernetes - Steve Gordon, Red Hat & Chandrakanth Jakkidi, F5 \n\nThis session will provide an introduction to the KubeVirt project, which turns Kubernetes into an orchestration engine for not just application containers but virtual machine workloads as well. This provides a unified development platform where developers can build, modify, and deploy applications made up of both Application Containers as well as Virtual Machines in a common, shared environment.  In the session, you will learn more about why KubeVirt exists, how people are using it today, and how the project actually works from an architectural perspective. You will also see a short demo of the project in action!  Finally, you will hear about future plans for developing KubeVirtâ€™s capabilities that are emerging from the community. \n\nhttps://sched.co/VyBC"
