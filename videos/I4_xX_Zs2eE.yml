In this talk, we will illustrate with architecture highlights and implementation details what this means, and how we chose to build it in Erlang.\n\nRead the full abstract: http://codesync.global/speaker/ulf-wiger/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - ULF WIGER\nErlang greybeard\n\nUlf Wiger has been using Erlang since 1992, bought the first-ever commercial license in 1993 and has been a full-time Erlang dev since 1996. While at Ericsson, he became something of an Erlang ambassadeur, speaking about the AXD 301 ATM Switch/Media Gateway and about how Erlang works in large industrial projects. After leaving Ericsson, Ulf joined Erlang Solutions as CTO. He then entered the Connected Device market first via the startup Feuerlabs, then as a freelance contractor to Jaguar Land Rover, and Lead Developer of GENIVIâ€™s Remote Vehicle Interaction component. Ulf joined the Aeternity Core Team in 2017 and is now busy exploring and developing blockchain technology. In the Open Source arena, Ulf is perhaps best known for components like Gproc, Jobs, and Exometer. In his spare time, Ulf doubles as an opera singer and dabbles in politics.\n\nMore on Ulf Wiger: http://codesync.global/speaker/ulf-wiger/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE MESH LDN 18\nCode Mesh LDN is powered by Code Sync.
