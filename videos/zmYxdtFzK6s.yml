description: "Kubernetes Networking: How to Write a CNI Plugin From Scratch - Eran Yanay, Twistlock \n\nCNI (Container Network Interface) plugins are the cornerstone of Kubernetes networking. CNI is the standardized way used by Kubernetes to expose network devices to pods, responsible for pod to pod communication across physical nodes in your cluster.  During this talk we will: - Explore the details of the CNI plugin interface - Understand how it is used with Kubernetes - Provide a detailed walkthrough of a simple CNI plugin from scratch  Attendees in this talk will gain insight into the process of creating a CNI plugin and get familiar with networking decisions required for having their pods connected and reachable from within the cluster and the internet.   \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPd2"
