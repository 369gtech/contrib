description: "Panel: Practising a Massive Public Disaster - How to Mitigate Risk When You Can’t Afford to Fail - Zenon Hannick, Armakuni, Deborah Wood, James Wynne, & Chisara Nwabara, Pivotal\n\nEach year, Comic Relief raises tens of millions of pounds to fight poverty. A few minutes of downtime during the annual TV event could mean missing out on millions of pounds to help those that need it most. For Sport Relief 2018 the platform was using Kubernetes for the first time. Hear how the app developers and operations teams ran extensive fire drills to practice troubleshooting across various layers of the stack under extreme load. Practising massive system failure built confidence in both team’s ability to support the event and ensure minimal time to recovery in case of disaster. Building, scaling and running a mission-critical multi-region multi-foundation solution is not for the faint-hearted or hero engineers; hear how collaboration across teams and the full platform stack allowed us to overcome the fear factor and avoid familiar pitfalls.\n\nhttps://cfseu18.sched.com/event/FRyy/panel-practising-a-massive-public-disaster-how-to-mitigate-risk-when-you-cant-afford-to-fail-zenon-hannick-armakuni-deborah-wood-james-wynne-chisara-nwabara-pivotal"
