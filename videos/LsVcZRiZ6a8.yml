title: 'Dr. Rochelle Carr: Breaking the Excuse Barriers in Leadership'
recordingDate: 1544403612
description: "Leadership is far more than interpreting a company’s mission and objectives and translating these into individual actions. Rather, it is an activity or set of attributes capable of producing powerful transformation, along with the ability to unleash innovation and development for both the leader and employees. As such, leadership development is an essential personal growth investment in today’s upward-moving business climate, as is the recognition that what’s worked in the past will not always work today. Yet it’s not about simply recreating the wheel – it’s about mindfully changing our approach. Leaders who are prepared to adjust by breaking excuse barriers are those who achieve personal and professional growth, greater employee engagement, and complete projects successfully. \n - Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/stretch\n\nhttp://www.stretchcon.com/"
