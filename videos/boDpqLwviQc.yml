description: "Getting data from the database, through the API, and to the WPF view - that's the goal of this video. Think of this as an end-to-end look at moving data. \n\nWe will start with updating the table, then move on to adding a stored procedure. After that, we will add the mode, set up data access, and add a new API endpoint with security. That gets us half way. \n\nThen on the front-end side, we will configure dependency injection, add an API call, pass in our bearer token, read back a model and map it to our front-end model, and finally display it properly on the view.\n\nPatreon ($5/month or more gets source code for this course as it comes out): https://www.patreon.com/IAmTimCorey\n\nNewsletter signup (with exclusive discounts, giveaways, and more):  https://signup.iamtimcorey.com/\n\nOne-off tutorials are awesome but they aren't the only thing you should be doing to learn C#. Another vital part of learning is learning how to put it all together. This interactive course is all about putting the pieces together. You can watch each video on its own or you can watch them in order and see a bigger picture. The choice is yours.\n\nThis course focuses on real-world development. As such, we are simulating that we work for TimCo Enterprise Solutions on a brand new product, the TimCo Retail Manager. Just like in the real world, we are starting out with one set of requirements but know that over time they will change."
