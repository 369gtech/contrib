description: "How do you get thousands of attendees to collaborate on a single, massive art project in the short timespan of a conference? We built a solution for this utilizing desktop CNC routers controlled by Java embedded technology with an Oracle Cloud backend. Affordable desktop CNC printers for subtractive prototyping are the next big Maker movement after the 3D printer revolution. CNC routers are the analog of 3D printers with the ability to remove material with full automation and repeatability and can cut a variety of materials from wood to plastic to soft metals. In this presentation we will demonstrate how you can use Java embedded technology running on a Raspberry Pi to control CNC routers and fabricate your own designs. Come to learn about the technology and stay to play with the cool demos and hardware!\n\nStephen Chin is the Lead Java Community Manager at the Oracle Technology Network, author of Raspberry Pi with Java, co-author of Pro JavaFX Platform, and JavaOne Community Chair. He has keynoted numerous Java conferences around the world including JavaOne, where he is a 5-time Rock Star Award recipient. Stephen is an avid motorcyclist who has done several Pan-European evangelism tours, interviewing hackers in their natural habitat and posting the videos on http://nighthacking.com/. When he is not traveling, he enjoys teaching kids how to do embedded and robot programming together with his 13 year old daughter.\n\nAlexander is principal software engineer in Java team at Oracle. He was a primary developer of a number of JavaOne demo projects such as the Chess Robot Demo, Internet of Things Automotive demo and has a history of more than 6 years of involvement into JavaOne demo projects. In the past Alexander was actively involved in JavaFX QA and development."
