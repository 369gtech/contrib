But if you learn it step by step, you'll find that there's a reason Git is quickly becoming the world's most popular version control systemâ€”not just for software developers, but also for teams that write documentation and collaborate on other work.\n\nMay 3 - Episode 2 - Collaborate with Git\nUse Git to track changes to source code and collaborate with other developers.
