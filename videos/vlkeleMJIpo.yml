recordingDate: 1533650888
description: "Security is a top concern for IoT implementers. IoT platforms have great security stories and track records around the cloud, but IoT security is much more than just the back-end. The server and desktop security knowledge does not apply directly to small less capable devices or $5 sensors deployed in the field.\nMake sure your webcam, electronic door lock or toaster does not take down Netflix, Twitter and Amazon like the IoT devices controlled by the Mirai botnet in 2016.\n\n\nThis session will discuss IoT security fundamentals and show the importance of applying security best practices, including how to implement connectivity and device security.\n\nObjectives:\n- Understand the IoT security challenges\n- Learn the fundamentals of device design security\n- Discuss device security and provisioning from birth to grave\n- Provide a solid overview of the Microsoft Azure security patterns"
