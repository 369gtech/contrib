recordingDate: 1542749818
description: "When working in teams on a project, we often observe that people don't tend not to use very collaborative solutions for their work. Documents get scattered across multiple folders or in emails, it gets harder to distinguish an old version of a document from a new one and we miss the possibility to link documents between each others.\n\nXWiki aims to provide a solution to this problem. Based on the concept of \"wiki\" : a website on which people can create pages and make links between them ; XWiki offers an actual platform that, in addition to providing every features needed for a good wiki (page history, links, hierarchy, …), allows the real creation of collaborative spaces.\n\nThis conference aims to show how XWiki can help any individual or team to build a knowledge base adapted to his needs. We will run through some of the most popular features proposed by XWiki to adapt the platform to company use cases.\n\nThe conference will be held as follows :\n\n* Presentation of the XWiki Open Source project and the concepts behind it ;\n* Demonstration of the creation of a knowledge base for a team with a specific use case ;\n* Questions and answers, either on the demonstration or more broadly on the Open Source project itself."
