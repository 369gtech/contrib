recordingDate: 1381881624
description: "Have you ever wondered how hundreds of developers from different companies around the world can produce quality software, with new features, on time? OpenStack is not only the fastest-growing open-source cloud project but is also a large-scale, complex system with a rapidly expanding code base and more than 1,000 contributors to date. Handling the quantity and pace of contributions is a huge challenge on its own.\n\nIn this webcast we'll cover:\n\n* Challenges of scaling a distributed development team to more than 1,000 unique contributors\n* The tools and processes developed by the OpenStack Core infrastructure team to handle increasing contribution activities while maturing software quality\n* How you can contribute to and make use of the same open source technologies for your development teams\n\nAbout James Blair\n\nJames works for the OpenStack Foundation and is a core member of the OpenStack project infrastructure team. As a sysadmin and hacker he gets to write elegant code and then try to make it work in the real world. He has been active in free software for quite some time, and has previously worked for UC Berkeley and the Free Software Foundation.\n\nProduced by: Yasmina Greco"
