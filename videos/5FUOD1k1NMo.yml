description: "Ближайшая конференция: \nDotNext 2021 Moscow — 21-22 октября, онлайн.\nПодробности и билеты: https://bit.ly/3BTQype\n\n. During this talk, we'll cover the theory and practical implementation behind the most common patterns in modern multi-threaded programming. How our everyday libraries and frameworks optimize the use of operating system resources for maximum efficiency. We'll also try to understand the differences between various approaches and what tradeoffs do they infer. Finally, we'll take a look at how they are supported by various compilers and runtimes."
