title: 'GeeCON 2019: Hrvoje Crnjak - Developer''s guide to selling your soul'
recordingDate: 1563984001
description: 'In almost every developer''s life there comes a time at which he/she has to choose. To go into management, or to stay in development. Now, if you''re a ''my concept of fun is reading about monads and category theory'' kind of developer, this will probably feel like you''re selling your soul to ''The Man''. But here''s the hard truth. No matter what you want to achieve in your professional life, chances are you''ll need other people to do that. So doing at least some sort of management is not an option, it''s a necessity. In this talk I''ll tell you my experience of going through this transformation. I''ll try to sum up my ups and downs into a quick and easy cookbook you can use in your day-to-day operations. So that you still have time to do what you love the most, develop!'
