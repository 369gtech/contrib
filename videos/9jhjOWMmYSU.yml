title: 'Toward Native JavaScript Performance on the JVM'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433231758
description: "The JVM, originally intended to be a Java runtime, is turning into a polyglot platform. This is a change that has picked up rapid speed these last few years. Dynamic languages such as JavaScript and Ruby are extra hard to turn into bytecode, because bytecode assumes static types. Nashorn, part of Java 8, has been engineered to provide good JavaScript performance on top of the JVM. These last 12 months, a special skunkworks project has taken place with the goal of getting to JavaScript near-native performance in several areas. This presentation shows how this is possible and then looks into the future. Most likely we will see a generic support library for fast dynamic languages on the JVM there.\n\n\nAuthor:\nMarcus Lagergren\nMarcus Lagergren has an MSc in computer science from the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. Lagergren has a background in computer security but has worked with runtimes since 1999. He was one of the founding members of Appeal Virtual Machines, the company that developed the JRockit JVM, which was bought by BEA Systems in 2002. Lagergren has been team lead and architect for the JRockit code generators and has been involved in most other aspects of JVMs over the years. From 2007 to 2010 he worked for Oracle on fast virtualization technology, and since late 2011 has been a member of the Oracle langtools team, investigating dynamic languages on the JVM. Lagergren is also a general runtime futurist, and co-author of the book Oracle JRockit: The Definitive Guide, which, despite the product-centric title, has been praised as the best book ever written on JVM internals in general.\nView more trainings by Marcus Lagergren at https://www.parleys.com/author/marcus-lagergren-1\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
