description: "Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a technique for building software, where feature development is guided by writing tests. While this technique is commonly used to build out business logic, it may be overlooked when it comes to security features, such as authentication and access control.\n \n In this talk, we'll build a secure application from the ground up using TDD. We'll look at what test driving means in the context of security features, by harnessing the Spring Security testing support.\n\nEleftheria Stein, Software Engineer at VMware\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/testdriven-security"
