description: "Erlang User Conference 2013\nMore info and slides on the website: http://www.erlang-factory.com/conference/ErlangUserConference2013/talks\n\nThe three of us (Joe, Robert and Mike) have more than 100 years combined experience of programming. We have noticed the vast majority of software development projects use programming languages based on concepts which were developed close on a half a century ago. Tools and development environments have changed, but with few exceptions the basic paradigms remain the same.\n\nWe will reflect on our experience, what is good, what is bad and what is ugly. How did the past and our experience influence us when we developed Erlang."
