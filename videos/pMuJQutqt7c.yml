The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nCloud Native Smart Contract with Knative - Jay Guo & Ying Chun Guo, IBM  \n\nSmart contract in blockchain carries out business logics by manipulating data in ledger. Hyperledger Fabric, a permissioned blockchain technology, manages lifecycle of smart contracts by building and running them in Docker containers. However, alleviated privilege is required to access Docker daemon, which is normally against security principal in enterprise. It is not scalable to co-locate smart contracts with Fabric on same host. Also, idle contracts can be waste of resource.  This session will cover in depth why smart contracts should be ran in cloud native fashion, and how this can benefit deployment, operation and performance. This talk will demonstrate the changes made to Fabric to offload smart contract lifecycle management to Knative, a Kubernetes native serverless platform. This talk will also walk through steps that deploy smart contract as Knative service exposed to Fabric. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UaX9"
