description: 'During this live coding session, we build both a Java EE application and a Spring application, using 10 productivity tools/projects/products that help coders get stuff done. Each tool is introduced live as itâ€™s used in the demo. The session addresses how applications can be developed and tested quickly, providing a development environment that enables us to deliver high-quality, performant code. It covers JIRA, Confluence, Tomcat/TomEE, Arquillian, JBoss Forge, JRebel, XRebel, IntelliJ, Jenkins, Gradle, and more.'
