description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2020 by Xiaoyi Li, Dashlane.\n\nMore info: https://android-makers-2020.firebaseapp.com/schedule/?sessionId=173975\n\nAs Android developers, security matters in Android development. With the rapid growth of Android devices in the world, Security has never been as important as it is today, and it will never be an outdated subject.\r\n\r\nThis session will talk about why derive a Password in application and how to do it on Android.\r\n\r\nPasswords or passphrases created by humans are often short or predictable enough to allow password cracking. Taking some examples of several common attacks we will explain why using the password directly for encryption and authentication is risky. We will understand how Secure Derivation of Passwords can prevent password cracking. And most important, we will talk about what are the solutions on Android.\r\n\r\nIn this talk you will learn password security on Android:\r\n- Cryptographic knowledge about password cracking\r\n- What is the key derivation\r\n- Solutions for key derivation\r\n- How to improve password security on Android using Password-based key derivation functions?\r\n- What are the existing Android framework API solutions, the limitations, the improvements?\r\n- On Android, how to use modern password-based key derivation functions such as PBKDF2 and Argon2\r\n\r\nAndroid engineers interested in improving password security and understanding cryptographic in Android development are definitely recommended to come to this talk."
