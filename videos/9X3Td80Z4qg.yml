title: 'YOW! 2013 Stewart Gleadow - No App Is An Island'
recordingDate: 1514385501
description: "Almost all apps rely on APIs, no app is an island, entire of itself. We want to keep our apps slick and simple, pushing complex logic to the server, allowing iOS devs to focus on shiny new user experiences. All the hipster developers are using microservices and deploying to the cloud, but what does that mean for your front end apps and APIs? At realestate.com.au, we’re building simpler apps backed by smarter microservices using REST, hypermedia and HATEOAS, not just object.to_json. This session will demonstrate how to quickly build iOS apps to discover, consume and navigate these services using HAL JSON, and some nifty Objective C libraries for networking and functional-reactive goodness in a way ‘future you’ will be thankful for.\n\nStewart Gleadow is developer and consultant with Bilue. His passion is in building great mobile experiences for apps and on the web, and in how to combine Agile methods with innovative product and delivery teams. His areas of focus are sustainable mobile architectures, APIs, maintainable iOS apps and automated app testing, as well as exploring emerging experiences on smartwatches and TVs. In particular, he’s looking at ways of using high level APIs to drive mobile applications, and to simplify the building and maintenance of these apps.\n\nFor more on YOW!
