description: "DjangoCon US 2018 - Wagtail CMS - Making Django More User (and Developer) Friendly by Sara Heins\n\nDjango is a robust framework that can handle a lot of complex problems. However, if your goal is to get a simple marketing website up and running, it can be a little too complicated - especially for beginners who are new to frameworks. The admin itself can also appear clunky and confusing to users, and the path to creating a new type of page is paved with views, urls, templates and more!\n\nWouldn’t it be nice to have an intuitive UI for the admin, and a quick, templated way to create pages in just a few lines of code?\n\nEnter Wagtail - a simple, yet elegant, content management system. With a beautiful admin (great for your clients), a Page class that abstracts things like url structures and views (great for beginners) and built-in WYSIWYG page models (great for on-the-fly content customization), you can focus on getting a flexible site up and running while still having the power of Django to solve complex problems (like querying) when you need it.\n\nThis talk will teach you the basics of how Wagtail can save you time and effort by not re-inventing the CMS wheel. It’s aimed at anyone who wants a more user-friendly, out-of-the-box CMS, whether you’re a beginner who is struggling to grasp the concepts of a framework or a seasoned developer looking to streamline this aspect of your project."
