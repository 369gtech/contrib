description: "Apps Need Data, Redux: The untold true(-ish) story of one developer’s search for a complete microservices platform - Dormain Drewitz & Cornelia Davis, Pivotal    \n\nMeet Jamie. Her team is building a new feature for a human resources application. It's going to make vacation requests so much more fun - almost as fun as the vacation itself! \n\nBut there's just one problem. \n\nThat HR application is a monolith. So Jamie sets out to figure out how she can build her service as a microservice. She thinks about managing the APIs that the monolith will use. She thinks about the persistence layer her application will need. She thinks about how she will secure her application. She thinks about how she will manage performance - oh the spikes of traffic before major holiday weekends! \n\nYou can probably guess where Jamie found such a platform that would support all her requirements (hint: Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, and Cloud Foundry). But in this talk, Dormain Drewitz and Cornelia Daviswill take you through the surprising twists and turns of how she got there. After all, Spring Boot makes it easy to make stand-alone Spring applications and Spring Cloud provides the scaffolding to coordinate distributed Boot apps, but what about API management? Performance monitoring? Persistence? It takes an ecosystem to complete a microservices platform.\n\nCornelia Davis\nPivotal\nSenior Director of Technology\nSan Francisco\nTwitter Tweet\nCornelia Davis is Sr. Director of Technology at Pivotal, where she works on the technology strategy for both Pivotal and for Pivotal customers.
