At its core, sites created with the Jamstack utilise static sites generated by various tools. Up until recently such static site generators were using frontend frameworks such as Vue.js and React, however recently the first Angular SSG has been created and it goes by the name of Scully. By the end of this talk attendees will be familiar with the Jamstack and its ecosystem including the capabilities and relevance of Scully.\n\nPer restare aggiornato su tutti gli #AperiTech:\nTelegram #AperiTech https://t.me/aperitech\nCalendario del Developer https://bit.ly/devcalendar\nCodemotion Tech Community https://bit.ly/CodemotionTC"
