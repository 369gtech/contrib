title: 'Design Patterns: Why Event Sourcing?'
language: English
recordingDate: 1513279801
description: "Event Sourcing has been becoming more and more popular over the last few years. Greg has been talking, teaching, and innovating in the Event Sourcing space since 2006. This talk will look in depth at what Event Sourcing is, when it may be valuable (more importantly when its not), and how problems can change when looked at through a different lens. There are many trade offs, misconceptions, and of course FUD associated around Event Sourcing, hopefully we can sort them all out.\n\nEVENT: Dutch PHP Conference 2016\n\nSPEAKER: Greg Young\n\nPERMISSIONS: The original video was published on Ibuildings Dutch PHP Conference YouTube channel with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nORIGINAL SOURCE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3uH3iiiDqY"
