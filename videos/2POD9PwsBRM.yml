description: "The world of virtual reality allows us to build new 3D interactive spaces that we can fill with anything we want - like the art of the great Renaissance masters. More into Cubism? With a quick click - now the gallery is full of a completely different genre. With new AR features, we can actually build the gallery in our own space - and just as easily swap out the art - all in our browser! In this talk, we’ll walk through the steps to build a virtual ARt gallery, with web technology available today, but also take a peek at the new WebXR technology that is coming to our browsers soon!\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
