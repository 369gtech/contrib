description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nOpenTelemetry Collector Deployment Patterns - Juraci Paixão Kröhling, Red Hat\n\nThe OpenTelemetry Collector is a versatile piece of software and can be deployed in numerous ways. In this talk, we’ll explore some of these patterns, starting with the classic “agent and collector” and landing at “scalable tail-based sampling,” talking about “multi-tenancy” along the way. We’ll see how they look in theory and practice with live demos on a real Kubernetes cluster. You’ll leave this session with knowledge about some of the essential processors for the OpenTelemetry Collector, how to employ them individually, and as part of a vaster deployment topology."
