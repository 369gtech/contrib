description: "\"From Oops... to Ops! Sloppy Little Serverless Stories\" by Sheen Brisals\nEverything fails all the time! A quote repeated by many everyday. How does it feel when things fail in production? How do you recover from such situations? How can you make sure they don't repeat? All these discussed with real production incidents and the measures taken to mitigate such failures. We will also look at few of the most common failure possibilities in a serverless ecosystem. Remember, when everything fails all the time, you must learn something everyday to be operational all the time!"
