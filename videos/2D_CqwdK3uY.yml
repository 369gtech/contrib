title: 'Introducing the Numenta Platform for Intelligent Computing (NuPIC)'

description: "From OSCON 2013. This new open source library is based concepts first described in Jeff Hawkins' book On Intelligence and subsequently developed by Numenta Inc. NuPIC consists of a set of machine learning algorithms that accurately model layers of neurons in the neocortex. NuPIC's algorithms continuously learn temporal patterns, make predictions, and detect anomalous behavior within streaming data. These are the same algorithms and code used in Numenta's commercial product, Grok.\n\nNuPIC represents a new approach to machine learning and machine intelligence. Given the large interest we have had from people wanting to study these algorithms and apply them in novel ways we created the NuPIC open source library and the accompanying Numenta.org website.\n\nIn this hands-on session, we'll introduce NuPIC's Online Prediction Framework (OPF) and demonstrate how one creates models using an OPF client. We'll set up some live streaming data to pass into the client and watch as NuPIC makes online inferences, learning the changing patterns in the streaming data set. NuPIC and the OPF have been applied to many scenarios and form the foundation for Numenta's commercial product, Grok. To master NuPIC you will have to become comfortable with concepts such as sparse distributed representations and on-line learning. You can read about these concepts and the algorithms in this white paper: https://www.numenta.com/htm-overview/education/HTM_CorticalLearningAlgorithms.pdf.\n\n - Don't miss an upload!
