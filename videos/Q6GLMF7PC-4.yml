The network traffic management in the application layer is one of the most complex and challenging problems. In this webinar, we will discuss and demonstrate how to effectively manage the network traffic in the application layer on AWS platform based on containers and serverless. The main contents include:\n1. How to use API gateway, ELB, K8s Ingress to manage the north-south traffic\n2. How to manage the east-west traffic in the cluster with service mesh\n3. How to manage network traffic with CI/CD\n4. How to use distributed tracing for network traffic"
