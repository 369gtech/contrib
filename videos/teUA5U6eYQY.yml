description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nDiscussion & Comments: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2019\n—\nModern C++ attributes such as [[noreturn]] and [[deprecated]] can be used to improve code quality and programmer productivity. They provide valuable information to the compiler, allowing it to generate more efficient code and provide more useful warning messages. C++20 is slated to include several new attributes, including [[no_unique_address]] and the design-by-contract attributes. They also let you use compiler extensions on specific toolchains without locking you into using only those toolchains.\n\nThis session explores several C++ attributes and provides examples of how to use each one to improve your programs. Although it focuses on the standard attributes, it also includes examples of non-standard attributes from specific toolchains.\n— \nBen Saks\nChief Engineer, Saks & Associates\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
