title: 'Letting Science Drive Technology at GlaxoSmithKline'
language: English
recordingDate: 1509731694
description: 'GlaxoSmithKline is a global science-led healthcare company whose mission is to help people do more, feel better, and live longer. In support of this mission, GSK not only discovers, develops and makes medicines that treat a broad range of the world''s most common acute and chronic diseases; but also must optimize this process to make them as quickly and widely accessible as possible. But in practice, innovation and process optimization doesn’t come naturally. Our Scientists will often download and deploy niche open source software to solve key scientific problems, resulting in adoption and abandonment of different software components. Additionally, to support the needs of our R&D organization by embedding analytics within the business, we have several Hadoop clusters with different hardware genotypes each with its own respective entry points. So many entry points can become a nightmare to manage let alone customize based on the needs of the end users. In this session, Ranjith Raghunath, Director, Big Data Solutions, Data Centre of Excellence and Lindsay Edwards, Head, Respiratory Data Sciences Group, will share how GSK is using Docker to deliver ‘edge nodes on demand,’ decoupling a gateway from a specific cluster, allowing users to move from one cluster to another while keeping everything they have intact, and reducing deployment of a production grade software package from 6 months to a few hours.'
