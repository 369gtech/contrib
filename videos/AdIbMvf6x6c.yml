description: "At MyScript we are building handwriting recognition technologies for more than 15 years. Recently we build a polymer component easing the integration of hand recognition in your webapp. We will briefly demo the different kind of technology accessible with our techno (Text, Math, Music ...) , how it works behind the scene with machine learning and then live-code an app with handwriting recognition.\n\nCome with your phone, tablet or laptop to see polymer in action !"
