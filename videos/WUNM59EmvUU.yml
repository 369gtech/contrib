title: 'BLACK FRIDAY: Lifelong tech- is this a joke?'
recordingDate: 1608125665
description: "A conversation around sustainability and most specifically climate change has been present in today's society for many years. And while there is a general understanding of what this means, it does feel at times that change towards a sustainable way of living -- and thus towards preserving the planet as we know it -- is a slow and tedious process.\n\nSo what can we do as a society? What could we do as an individual? And how could technology and innovation help drive that change? \n\nWe would like to explore and discuss all of this in a series of events that we call Critical Tech & Sustainability.\n\nIn our first event, we want take a closer look together at the electronic devices of our day-to-day life and our relationship with them.\n\nWe all use and even rely heavily on electronic devices for many things. But it is hard to ignore that their life expectancy and thus time with us can be surprisingly limited. Why is that?\n\nOpening modern electronic devices reveals a large amount of intricate components. But how do they work and what are they made of? And what happens when we throw them into the recycle bin? What can we do to reduce our electronic waste and are there any alternative approaches to our habits of consumption?\n\nTogether with volunteers from Repair Cafe, an organization who helps individuals learn how to repair things, we would like to find answers to the questions above and dive into the areas of (product) policy and lifetime extension. Jessika from Repair Cafe focuses in her research on the topic of environmental impact of electronics and circular economies, and can share some findings from that research.\n\n\n___________________________\nFoo Café is a meeting place for people with an interest in software development and IT. \nHere, user groups and partner companies find the perfect atmosphere for sharing knowledge and develop competence. \nFoo Café is open for everyone and is free to attend. To make an event at Foo Café, you have to become a partner company with us or you can run a user group with an in-depth technical focus.\nWe welcome companies with sponsor challenges.\nWe are currently present in Stockholm and Malmö and have made over 2048 tech events since the start in 2012. \nAt Foo Café there’s an event going on everyday, year round."
