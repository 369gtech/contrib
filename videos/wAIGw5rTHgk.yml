description: "Four Tips for Optimal Performance\n\nWith much of the processing in modern AJAX-based applications taking place within the browser itself, in the cloud, or through calls to third party services, traditional data center-based monitoring solutions have significant blind spots. Because this activity frequently does not generate calls back to the organization's network, it becomes necessary to also monitor activity at the edge, from within the browser itself, to obtain a complete picture of application performance.\n\nJoin us for a live webcast led by Dell web performance expert Steve Fox, and DevOps/Cloud expert Keith Hudgins. You'll see why common web monitoring practices fall short of pinpointing key issues, and learn effective alternatives to ensure your current monitoring is adequate.\n\nRegister today to discover:\n\n-Why you should treat AJAX performance differently than other web monitoring initiatives\n-How monitoring approaches must adapt to adequately meet the challenges presented by DevOps and Cloud\n-Four technical tips for getting a true handle on web and mobile application performance\n\nAbout Steve Fox\n\nSteve is Product Manager for Dell Foglight.
