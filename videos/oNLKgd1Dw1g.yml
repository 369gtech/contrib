This workshop is for everyone that is still stuck with PHP 5, and wants to review his million LOC project before jumping to PHP 7.\n\nWhen migrating, we need to check old code and target only the interesting issues. This session will connect the backward incompatibilities and new features to actual location in the code, relying on static analysis to process quickly large code base. Based on the accumulated experience of the tools and our own, we'll review the issues, diagnose criticality, select the best fixes and prioritize the tasks. All tools are Open Source, and ready to be integrated into your project life.\n\nAbout the speaker:\n\nDamien Seguy is CTO at Exakat Ltd., a company specialized in PHP code quality solutions for the industry.
