title: 'Naoufal Kadhom - React Native Payments  Bringing the Payment Request API to React Native'
recordingDate: 1536920890
description: "What if I told you that accepting payments in mobile apps could be easy and that you could use a single API to accept payments across three different platforms? In this talk, weâ€™ll learn about the Payment Request API, a new W3C standard that dramatically simplifies accepting payments on the web, and how we can use React Native Payments to leverage it in our mobile apps.\n\nThis talk was presented at React Native EU 2017, September 6-7, Wroclaw, Poland."
