description: "Saurav Joshi\nOracle\n\nBuilding an end to end Data science & Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline is tricky. There are multiple challenges from taming Big Data at scale to selection of right A.I Algorithms and tool set.  The problem gets quadrupled when the hype and noise around A.I and Big Data is added.  The presentation would attempt to demystify some of the myths and focus on building and end to end pipeline. It will further discuss how Oracle’s Open Public Cloud can address the most critical problem of the puzzle by providing the infrastructure to run A.I at scale."
