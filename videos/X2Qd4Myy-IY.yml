title: ' DevTernity 2019:  Sergei Egorov â€“ Integration Testing with Docker and Testcontainers'
language: English
recordingDate: 1576870311
description: 'Unit testing is fine, but without proper integration testing, especially if you work with external resources like databases and other services, you might not know how your application will actually behave once it has been deployed to the real production environment. Testcontainers is a popular JVM testing library that provides lightweight, throwaway instances of common databases, Selenium web browsers, or anything else that can run in a Docker container. In this talk, we will briefly go throught the past, present and the future of the library.'
