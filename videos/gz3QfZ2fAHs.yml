description: "Want to view more sessions and keep the conversations going? Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe in Barcelona, May 20–23 (https://bit.ly/2B2vhMl), in Shanghai, June 24–26 (https://bit.ly/2JZcBjs), or in San Diego November 18–21 (https://bit.ly/2K031wW) in 2019. \n\nDeep Dive: SIG Cluster Lifecycle - Di Xu & Alexander Kanevskiy, Intel \n\nThe Cluster Lifecycle SIG is the Special Interest Group that is responsible for building the user experience for deploying and upgrading Kubernetes clusters. Our mission is examining how we should change Kubernetes to make it easier to operate. Since the group's formation we have primarily focused on creating kubeadm, a streamlined installer tool and building block to simplify the installation and upgrade experience, and enhance kops, the easiest OSS way to get a production-grade Kubernetes cluster up and running in AWS. We have recently begun building a Cluster API to provide an abstraction of machines across different deployment environments along with a common control plane configuration. In this Deep dive session, we will review recent accomplishments, and discuss our future development plans, where you are very welcome to contribute to the discussion. \n\nTo learn more click here:\_ https://sched.co/FzI2"
