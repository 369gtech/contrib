Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nScaling Your Cluster (Both Ways) - Scott Coulton & Patrick Chanezon, Microsoft \n\nKubernetes has many ways to scale your workloads, most of what we hear about is scaling our cluster up with either with vm sets or autoscaling groups. There is another way, in this talk we will look at virtual kubelet. Virual Kubelet will allow us to talk to a cloud providers container as a service platform like ACI, fargate or ECI. We will deep dive into how you can scale your applications across virtual kubelet. One issue is the kubernetes service type has is scaling to zero due to the way routing to the pod happens if there is no pod for the service to route too. Scaling our applications to zero is just as important and scaling up. We will look at projects that integrate with the horizontal pod autoscaler that fix this issue. Allowing us to not only scale our applications up but as easily down to make our cluster truly elastic. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Uacu"
