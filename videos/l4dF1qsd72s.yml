description: "Agile evangelists typically tell companies that each of their teams needs a Scrum Master. However, we rarely show proof of their added value to the teams. Could it be that 18 years after the Agile Manifesto, we still do not know how to measure the performance of a Scrum Master? In this talk, we will look at metrics for each of the three aspects of a Scrum Master role: Facilitator, Servant Leader and Change Agent. I will provide Scrum Masters with practical tips on how to continuously measure themselves and use that as an argument for pay raises in their performance reviews and a larger lever in the change process. While metrics are often seen as negative, we will have a look at the Do‘s and Don’ts of using them and why Scrum Masters should actually be eager for their companies to introduce metrics. Come and join me for a different view on this controversial topic.\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
