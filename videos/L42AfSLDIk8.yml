description: "An Introduction to CoreOS \nby Dom Davis (@idomdavis)\n\nDocker, containers and immutable infrastructure seem to be the buzzwords of the day, but while it’s easy to get immutable infrastructure in Docker it’s not always so easy with the infrastructure that runs the infrastructure. Enter CoreOS, a simple, relatively lightweight Linux implementation designed out of the box to run containers as distributed infrastructure. In this talk we’ll be having a brief look at what CoreOS is, why it’s needed, and some of the things you can do with it.\n\nDom Davis is a veteran of The City and a casualty of The Financial Crisis. Not content with bringing the world to its knees he then went off to help break the internet before winding up in Norfolk where he is now a technology evangelist for a small startup. Dom is an enthusiastic and impassioned speaker [read: he gabbles] who uses a blend of irreverent sarcasm and flippant humour to bring complex technical subjects to a broad audience. Whether or not they understand him is up for debate, but he likes to believe they do."
