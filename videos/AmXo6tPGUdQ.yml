description: "gRPC is a popular technology for microservices, leveraging HTTP/2 and Protobufs for efficient service-to-service communication. Did you know you can add http and json support to gRPC for rich client-to-service APIs?\n\nNamely, an HR SaaS company, has adopted gRPC and developed open-source tools to create grpc-gateways and GraphQL endpoints. This talk will be a brief overview of gRPC, and cover how you can add http annotations for generating gateways, and how Namely built an API suite using this technique. You can also use Google Cloudâ€™s API Gateway product to automatically map http/json requests to microservices."
