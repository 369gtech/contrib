title: 'Web UI Testing in Python'
language: English
recordingDate: 1638743605
description: "Unit tests are great, but they don’t catch all bugs because they don’t test features like a user. However, Web UI tests are complicated and notoriously unreliable. So, how can we write tests well? Never fear! Let’s learn how to write robust, scalable Web UI tests using Python, pytest, and Selenium WebDriver that cover the full stack for any Web app. In this talk, we will write one simple test together that covers DuckDuckGo searching. You’ll learn how to write battle-hardened Web UI tests for any Web app, including Django and Flask apps. I’ll also provide plenty of hands-on tutorials and resources to continue learning after this talk.\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).
