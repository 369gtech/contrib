title: 'Don’t Start Up With Hidden Debt: Understanding and Managing Technical Debt'
language: English
recordingDate: 1453310379
description: "Technical debt is a metaphor developed by Ward Cunningham (developer of the first Wiki and pioneer in patterns and XP) to frame the problem of the inevitable trade-offs made between rushing to capture market vs. the longer term viability of code and infrastructure. As a startup, these trade-off decisions will never be more constant and far reaching. While technical debt may be unavoidable, understanding and managing technical debt from the beginning is crucial to a startup’s ability to grow and scale. Members from the eBags IT Team share their perspective and experience with technical debt as a successful Denver startup 16+ years in.\n\nPresenters: Jamie Koback, Mike Frazzini, Henry Fieger and Scott McRae of eBags"
