title: 'The Bleeding Edge at Scale: 80-million users on Serverless and GraphQL - Tyler Love'
recordingDate: 1542181669
description: "This talk focuses on the story of adopting GraphQL and Serverless at Bustle. I will talk about our product and goals and how Serverless and GraphQL weren't just imposed on our team but won over traditional approaches to architecture holistically. My talk starts with a story of the caveats faced with existing architecture and how incrementally we wound up on the bleeding edge. I discuss in-depth what DevOps conventions we applied to make it work. How and why we chose the tools we did. What impact it had on our costs. How it improved DevOps. Through out the talk I provide takeaways and philosophies that we learned and applied that help attendees and organizations evaluate trade-offs for themselves. The goal isn't to prescribe a method for all companies but offer perspective from a company that adopted it early at scale.\n\nFull Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLp4wchugWzHunbhpQtRRE1XQtliXIkuYU\nWebsite: https://milan.serverlessdays.io\nServerlessDays Map: https://serverlessdays.io/map"
