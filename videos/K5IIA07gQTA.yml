description: "Google Tech Talk\r\nMay 1, 2009\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nMIMO Radios and Geolocation: Instant Networks Using Coin-sized Ultrawideband MIMO Localizers\r\nPresented by Vincent Coli\r\n \r\nUltraWide-Band (UWB) radio technology provides fine time resolution and excellent material penetration. This Tech talk covers research using custom radio chips, smart antenna's, and coding techniques to design handheld \"Localizer's\" which transmit and receive coded pulses to communicate and measure distances between nodes. Several nodes can be used to form a mobile ad hoc network that provides accurate 3D position and communication or the transmissions of the nodes can be coordinated in time as a MIMO to perform beam forming and steering to increase range and data rate."
