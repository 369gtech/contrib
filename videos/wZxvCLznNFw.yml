description: "There's a whole lot of spatial data out there. It's in your databases, in your spreadsheets, and streaming in from the great devices in all of our pockets. Getting the data isn't so much of a problem these days, but organizing it and sharing it across many applications is still a challenge. On-premise server software isn't for everyone, and pushing data to the cloud often raises questions about data ownership and security. What you need is a SaaS solution that has minimal startup costs and allows you to remain in control of your data. We will show you how this is possible with a system that gives you that control, helps you reach the audience you want, and gives you access to all sorts of useful services that are shared by a trusted geospatial community. This opens up a whole new world for developers to create meaningful geospatial apps that can be rapidly taken to market with a low initial investment.\n\nBern Szukalski\n\nEsri\n\nBern Szukalski has a degree in Biology and Chemistry and a background in both environmental consulting and biomedical research. A love of maps eventually led him to Esri in 1986 where he began his geospatial career as an applications specialist working on the Peacekeeper Rail Garrison and CIA World DataBank projects. Over the past 25 years at Esri he has held a variety of positions and served in many different roles, covering a broad spectrum of GIS implementation and software development projects. Bern is currently a product strategist and technical evangelist, focusing on ways to broaden access to geographic information and GIS capabilities.\n\nJeff Archer\n\nEsri, Inc.\n\nJeff Archer is a Senior Technical Engineer within the Esri Technical Marketing group. Jeff came to Esri 12 years ago from a background of applying geospatial technology to solve complex business problems in the energy industry. His current role involves building application prototypes using emerging web\\mobile technology and Esri's ArcGIS family of products, and staying abreast of the important topics and technology trends that affect how people interact with location."
