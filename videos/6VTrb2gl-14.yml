description: "Google Tech Talks\nNovember,  7 2007\n\nDigital cameras in their many forms will continue to be one of the\nprimary drivers towards new technologies in optics as well as\nimprovements of classical technologies. This has been well illustrated\nin the past 5-10 years which has seen, for example, the development of\ncompression molded glass aspheric lenses for improved performance and\npackaging. The incorporation of injection molded plastic lenses and\npossibly hybrid refractive/diffractive surfaces will grow.\nFurthermore, as the trend continues towards smaller pixels as well as\nmore pixels in a given sensor, the imaging optics will be further\ndriven towards higher image quality. Zoom lenses will increase in\ntheir zoom range, yet there will be a continuing emphasis towards\nsmaller and smaller packaging. The optics and their associated\nmechanics will need to be more robust with respect to stray light such\nas flare, glare, ghost images, and other undesirable image anomalies.\nAnd our optics must be more robust with respect to environmental\neffects such as thermal soaks and gradients. And with all of the\nabove, customers will want lower cost too. It is going to be a fun\nride over the next 5-10 years so fasten your seat belt and hold on\nreal tight to the safety bar!\n\nSpeaker: Robert E. Fischer, CEO OPTICS 1, Inc. Westlake Village, CA\nBob Fisher is CEO of Optics 1, a past president of the SPIE, and a\nwinner of that society's highest award, the Gold Medal for outstanding\nengineering or scientific accomplishments in optics andelectro-optics.\n Mr. Fischer's technical interests are in optical system design and\nengineering, in particular lens design.  He is also interested in\noptical component and system manufacturing, assembly, and testing.\nHis interests extend from the deep UV through the visible and on to\nthe thermal infrared.  He is known for his tireless efforts to advance\noptical science, engineering and scholarship. He served as a book\neditor of the McGraw-Hill Series on Optical and Electro-Optical\nEngineering, and as executive editor of OE Reports, bringing timely\nand practical information to professionals in the field."
