title: 'Mark Knichel: JavaScript Tools at Scale Using Type Information | JSConf EU 2014'
language: English
recordingDate: 1415640719
description: "2013 and 2014 has seen the rise of JavaScript parsers that generate a consumable AST (such as Esprima or Acorn) and static analysis tools that operate on that AST (eslint, esmangle, or escodegen, or graspjs). These tools all operate on the structure of JS but have to rely on the AST node type or full name to modify the underlying code. With type information, static analysis and refactoring tools could be made more powerful by being able to accurately refer to any JavaScript statement in the codebase.\n\nIn this talk Iâ€™ll show how to use declared and inferred type information to make JavaScript safer to use at scale (think prevent XSS) and how to use simple JavaScript templates to apply complex automated refactorings in minutes throughout extremely large code bases.\n\nTranscript & slides: http://2014.jsconf.eu/speakers/mark-knichel-javascript-tools-at-scale-using-type-information.html\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
