description: "DevDay (http://devday.pl),\n20th of September 2013, Krak√≥w\n\nMarco Cecconi - \"The Architecture of StackOverflow\"\n\nDescription:\n\"Stack Overflow, and its Q&A network Stack Exchange, have been growing exponentially for the last four years. They now encompass:\n- 103 Q&A sites\n- 3.6 million users\n- 6.5 million questions\n- 11.9 million answers\n\nIn this talk, I will describe:\n- The physical architecture of Stack Overflow. How many servers are there? What is their purpose and what are their specs?\n- The logical architecture of the software. How do we scale up? What are the main building blocks of our software?\n- The tooling system. What supports our extreme optimization philosophy?\n- The development team. What are our core values? What footprint do we want to leave as developers?\""
