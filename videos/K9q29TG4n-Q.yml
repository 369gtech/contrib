title: 'Mandy Michael - Variable Fonts and Responsive Typography'
language: English
recordingDate: 1600166926
description: "Variable Fonts allow typography on the web to adapt to the flexible nature of screens, environments and devices. \n\nWe can use variable fonts with pre-existing technologies to improve the performance, design, accessibility and usability of our websites. We can start to design our typography to adjust to various inputs, situations or events using Media Queries, JS events and the Sensor or Audio Apis. This will allow us to modify our fonts to aid in storytelling, achieve improved readability and legibility in different situations, environments or on larger or smaller screens. \n\nLetâ€™s explore new and exciting creative opportunities for storytelling, design and expression in ways standard fonts could never provide us. This is just the beginning of our journey to discover what we can do with variable fonts.\n\nSlides: https://noti.st/mandy/2W12mw/very-responsive-typography-with-variable-fonts"
