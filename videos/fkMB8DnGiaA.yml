title: 'Sponsor Demo: Rancher - K3s and Raspberry Pi to Go - Portable and Practical'
language: English
recordingDate: 1600177440
description: 'K3s is Rancher''s CNCF-certified lightweight Kubernetes distribution designed for resource-constrained environments like IoT and the edge. It''s fast and versatile, and to demonstrate, Sheldon Lo-A-Njoe from Rancher Labs has built a 6-node Raspberry Pi cluster into a Pelican case, complete with a video display and programmable LEDs.  In today''s demo he''ll give a quick walkthrough on installing and using K3s with an introduction to Rancher for managing it. He follows this with a deployment of the chaos engineering tool KubeInvaders that uses the LED array to show the creation and deletion of Pods while shooting down an attacking alien horde. It''s everything you can imagine - cool, awesome, informative, and fun, and you''ll walk away from it with a smile and an understanding of not only how pervasive Kubernetes will become in the near future, but also for how ready Rancher and K3s are to meet you there.'
