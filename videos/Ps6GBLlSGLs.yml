description: "Google I/O 2009 - Bespin and the Open Web\r\n\r\nDion Almaer, Ben Galbraith\r\n\r\nThe Bespin project from Mozilla Labs is an experiment in re-envisioning how we develop software. In its current guise as a sometimes-fast web-based text editor shrouded in a horribly incomplete code editing platform, its potential might not be readily apparent. In this talk, Ben and Dion (two of the folks behind Bespin) will discuss the goals of the project, how they got to where we are now, go into implementation details on what it takes to build a bleeding edge application for today's browsers (and not the ones from 1997) and share some hopes and thoughts on the future.\r\n\r\nFor presentation slides and all I/O sessions, please go to: code.google.com/events/io/sessions.html"
