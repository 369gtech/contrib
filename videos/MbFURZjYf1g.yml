description: "Panel: Look inside your smartphone and learn why (size) accuracy matters!\nPanel moderator: Justyna Redelkiewicz (GSA)\nPanelists: Kamil Grondys (Samsung R&D Institute Poland), Ed Parsons (Google), Manuel del Castillo (Broadcom)\n\nPart 1: presentation\n\nContent: GPS(GNSS) is considered a commodity inside smartphones, a few decades old technology with little room for innovation. Location information are used today in 50% of applications that are available for download in app stores. For most of them (check in on Facebook, car navigation, search of nearby restaurant, taxi ordering) the location accuracy of around 10 meters offered today is good enough. It is not good enough however for the applications of the future: Internet of Things, Autonomous Cars, Drones, Personal robots etc. The technology providers know this and there is already a silent revolution happening inside your smartphone: super powerful chipsets that can process data from 4 GPS-like systems at the same time for better accuracy, location data from various technologies (GNSS, wi-fi, sensors) integrated seamlessly in one device, OS providers making necessary changes to make these innovations available to the application developers and users. Now it is time for IT developers to get inspired and make business around these innovations.\n\nPart 2: panel discussion\n\nRepresentatives from global top chipset industry, handset providers and OS providers will confirm they are ready to empower the new IT apps with new level of location accuracy. During the panel we will also touch upon the concerns of data privacy – if my phone knows at any point of time where I am, it better keeps it for itself!\n\nThe panel took place on 2017-05-17 at infoShare 2017 (Inspire Stage) in Gdańsk.\nhttp://infoshare.pl\n\nFollow infoShare:\nhttps://facebook.com/infosharepl\nhttps://twitter.com/infosharepl\nhttps://instagram.com/infoshare/\nhttps://linkedin.com/company-beta/1272775/\nhttps://plus.google.com/+infoshare/"
