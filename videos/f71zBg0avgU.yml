title: 'Codemotion Berlin 2019 I The 20 Year Platform - Why Cloud Native will be relevant for you'
language: English
recordingDate: 1601628139
description: "Cloud Native is the modern architecture for the next 20 years of application development. Open Source technologies combined with Cloud have defined a new platform allowing developers to rapidly build and operate high scale applications. We will discuss the key role Kubernetes plays in this platform and the work underway to align 12-factor applications and serverless functions with Kubernetes through the Knative project. We will also talk about service meshes with Istio and how developers need to think differently about continuous delivery, the development process and application architectures.\nLanguage: English\n\nAbout: Michael Behrendt, Distinguished Engineer, IBM:\n\nMichael is a Distinguished Engineer, Serverless / FaaS & IBM Cloud Functions Chief Architect for IBM."
