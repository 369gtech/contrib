For example, std::partial_sort takes considerably more time to sort half a vector than std::sort to sort it completely... \nStarting from this counter-intuitive result, we'll engage on a journey where we'll look at the standard, read implementations of the STL and benchmark code to understand how std::sort, std::nth_element and std::partial_sort are implemented and why. In the process, we'll see some of the challenges STL implementers encountered and how they chose to overcome them. \nThis session is targetted at STL users who are curious to know how their tool are working.\n— \nFrederic TINGAUD, Development, Murex S.A.S\nFred Tingaud is the creator of quick-bench.com. | He is also a Principal Software Engineer at Murex where he works on UI and front-end APIs. | His interests range from code efficiency and readability to UI ergonomics.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
