description: "There's tons of options for doing data processing in other languages like Java and Python. With actionhero.js, you can use Nodejs's event loop model to create a scalable and cohesive API for processing and serving large amount of data. From the actionhero.js documentation, here's a quick synopsis of this great framework:\n\nìactionhero.js is a multi-transport API Server with integrated cluster capabilities and delayed tasks. The goal of actionhero is to create an easy-to-use toolkit for making reusable & scalable APIs.î\n\nIn this session, we'll use actionhero.js to build some examples, with lots of code, to demonstrate the capabilities of this framework. We'll consume some data, do some task processing, then access the data via an API. We'll use Websockets along with standard HTTP to build a real-time, web-enabled, application.\n\nEVENT:\n\nÿredev 2017\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nPratik Patel\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nÿredev Conference Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video."
