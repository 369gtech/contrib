description: "VB.NET and C# are both .NET programming languages. They both compile down into the same intermediate language. So which language should you choose to develop in? Does it really matter? In this video, we are going to discuss the origins of VB.NET and C#, look at the two languages side by side, and look to the future of each as well. By the end of this video, you should have a much better grasp on why each of these languages exists and why you should choose one over the other.\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/IAmTimCorey\n\nNewsletter signup (with exclusive discounts, giveaways, and more):  https://signup.iamtimcorey.com/"
