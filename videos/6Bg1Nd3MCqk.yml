title: 'Antanas Kompanas: When SCRUM is not enough'
recordingDate: 1413867062
description: "Antanas Kompanas is a long time employee of Baltic Amadeus. During his 10+ year carrier he worked as a developer, project manager, consultant and architect both in local and out-sourced teams in Lithuania and abroad. The last two years he was a member of a .NET development team that was improving and extending a big enterprise solution for a Scandinavian client and directly contributed to the evolution of team’s and client’s understanding and application of agile methods.\n\nWhen SCRUM is not enough\n\nOnce you start using SCRUM and its time-boxing approach there is a natural urge to put everything into the sprint to get better control of it: initial analysis, architecture, testing, meetings, etc... However, it turns out that it’s not that simple and some tasks are just not meant to be handled in sprint. In this session we will explore how usage of SCRUM evolved in one of the development teams in Baltic Amadeus while working on a big enterprise solution and how we managed to stabilize sprint scope by offloading particular development tasks to KANBAN. We will also show what stages each user story must pass to make it work well in an enterprise environment."
