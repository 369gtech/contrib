description: "Talk recording from Amsterdam JSNation 2018 Conference https://amsterdamjs.com\n\nBringing Mobile Web back to Life\n\nWe rebuilt the whole Pinterest mobile web experience for authenticated users. It looks and feels just like our native apps while maintaining the fast load times expected of mobile web. We used cutting edge technologies which led to a 40% increase in each of our core engagement metrics and up to 30% in time spent. But it was not all sunshine and rainbows ! In this talk I will share challenges, technologies and best practices that we used for the new Mobile Website."
