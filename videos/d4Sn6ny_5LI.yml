description: "Time series is the fastest growing category of data out there! It's a series of data points indexed in time order. Often, a time series is a sequence taken at successive equally spaced points in time. In this video, I'll cover 8 different time series techniques that will help us predict the price of gold over a period of 3 years. We'll compare the results of each technique, and even consider using a learning technique. From Holts Winter Method to Vector Auto Regression to Reinforcement Learning, we've got a lot to cover here. Enjoy! \n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/Time_Series_Prediction\n\nPlease Subscribe! And Like. And comment. Thats what keeps me going.\n\nWant more education?
