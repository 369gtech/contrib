On top of this, projects like Katana are gaining in popularity. The latest project from Microsoft, Helios, is like NodeJs fully async and implements the very core of a \nweb server.\nWe will in this session\nexplore, code and deploy the new Microsoft stack to various environments.\n\nSpeaker\nMarcus Classon (@marcla) is founder and architect at Stratiteq in Malm√∂. He has been developing software professionally since 1994 and in .NET since 2002."
