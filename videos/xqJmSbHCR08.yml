Anusha Bhat - Multi-threading in Javascript - Myth or Reality?\n\nWith the advent of PWAs, we are delegating a lot of processing to the client-side. With JS being single-threaded, at times this results in jitter. Consider an example of client-side filtering on a very big list or image processing. Here, the main thread is blocked resulting in the end user being blocked.\n\nWhat should we do now? Is it necessary to do all the computations in the main thread? Wonâ€™t it be great if we can perform computations in a worker thread and then notify the main thread about it?\n\nHere comes background thread to the rescue. We can perform a heavy computation task in the background thread. Due to this, the main thread is unblocked and so is the user. Background and main thread can communicate asynchronously. This talk will will be focussing on how we can now use background threads in JavaScript and do multithreading in it. \n\n\n2. Lucien Immink - 1 component a day keeps the doctor away. \n\nLet's talk about web components and how they help to build scalable and maintainable applications. Do you need to replace your whole front-end stack by web components or can you replace bit by bit? Spoiler: it's the latter. Ever wondered if they play well with Angular, react or vue.js?\n\n \nLucien is a Software Architect by day, audiophile by night Lucien tries to find the bigger picture while working with the details that make front-end development what it is: The best job in the world. Has a strong feeling that the internet should be inclusive, accessibility is a must!\n\n\n3. Rolf Strijdhorst - Functional Programming"
