title: '#HITBCyberWeek D2T1 - Jailbreaks Never Die: Exploiting iOS 13.7'
language: English
recordingDate: 1607244325
description: "This talk will reveal the iOS 13 exploits I showcased earlier on Twitter (@08Tc3wBB) – an exploit chain for iOS 13.7 that relies upon a different kernel vulnerability since the 13.6 update patched the old one. I’ll be talking about the root cause and techniques used during the exploit development to bypass the mitigations that are unique to iOS to ultimately get the privilege of reading and writing kernel memory.\n\n=== \n\n08Tc3wBB is a Bug Bounty Hunter and a Security Researcher."
