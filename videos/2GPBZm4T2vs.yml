description: "Best Practices for DevOps-Ready Infrastructure Management and Automation\n\nAngelo Lynn, Solution Engineer, Electric Cloud \n\nInfrastructure management and self-service environment provisioning are key building blocks of DevOps. Configuration Management and Infrastructure-as-Code have paved the way to enable DevOps-ready infrastructure, yet supporting it at scale comes with a unique set of challenges.\n\nOrganizations needing to support large number of releases, complex applications, and deployments across large-scale clusters or hybrid environments experience challenges around operationalizing environment configurations and IT policies at scale. These challenges include ensuring fidelity across environment, security, reservation, scheduling and visibility, as well as VM sprawl and infrastructure cost increase.\n\nThis talk focuses on several use cases and best practices for infrastructure management and automation to support large-scale DevOps – for both legacy applications, as well as modern technologies such as microservices and containers.\n\nDOES17 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
