description: "Speaker(s):\nEvan Rapoport, Luc Vincent\n\nDescription:\nGoogle Maps is creating the world's most comprehensive geolocated photo library through Street View. We're also empowering anyone to contribute photos and 360-degree panoramas to Google Maps via products like Trekker, Business View, Views, and Photo Sphere. In this talk, we'll show how developers can integrate billions of panoramas into their projects. We'll also show how anyone can quickly publish imagery of places they care about, then easily access them via our APIs and viewers. This session is relevant to developers creating experiences that include location and imagery.\n\nWatch all Google I/O 2014 videos at: g.co/io14videos"
