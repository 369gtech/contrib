description: "Marmaray is Uberâ€™s open source, general-purpose Apache Hadoop data ingestion and dispersal framework and library. Built and designed by Uber's Hadoop Platform team, Marmaray allows Apache Hadoop users to add support to ingest data from any source and disperse to any sink leveraging the use of Apache Spark. The name, Marmaray, comes from a tunnel in Turkey connecting Europe and Asia. Similarly, we envisioned Marmaray within Uber as a pipeline connecting data from any source to any sink depending on customer preference. \n\nDuring this Uber Open Summit Sofia 2019 presentation, senior engineer Eric Sayle discusses how to leverage Marmaray for your own Big Data ecosystems.\n\nLearn more about the Uber Open Summit Sofia 2019: https://uberopensofia.splashthat.com/"
