recordingDate: 1400655878
description: "Slides: https://speakerdeck.com/istanbultechtalks/itt-2014-matt-brenner-localization-2-dot-0\n\nWhat developers want is localization which is uniform across platforms (Android, iOS, Windows Phone, HTML/5), fully supports static and dynamic phrases, eliminates mixing and matching file types, and integrates seamlessly (largely transparently) into the development process. Welcome to Localization 2.0, the next generation. If you have already undertaken localization, this talk will show you the benefits of Localization 2.0 and how to achieve them. If you haven't begun localization, learn how to avoid the costly shortcomings of outdated localization approaches."
