The game of Go has 1.74×10^172 unique positions and is about a 'googol' times harder to calculate than chess. Experts thought it would take at least another decade before A.I. would be able to beat the best human players. So how did DeepMind tackle this problem? What algorithms did they [...]\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotoams.nl/2019/sessions/760\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOamst\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttp://gotocon.com\n#AI #ML #ArtificialIntelligence #MachineLearning #AlphaGo #DeepMind\n\nVideo Credits\nDeepMind: https://www.youtube.com/DeepMind"
