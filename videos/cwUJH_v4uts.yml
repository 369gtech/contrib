description: "In three parts, we'll demystify digital accessibility and why it matters, going over some of the reasons why things are so inaccessible. We'll learn why inclusion is one of the fastest ways to a great design and good business, what it means to have different access needs, and why you should care. Finally, we'll end with some ways we can take action immediately, as a balanced team, to make our products better and more accessible for everyone.\n\nSpeaker: Eliza Aierstuck; Senior Software Engineer, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2019\nSlideShare: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/everyone-should-be-able-to-use-your-software-building-an-inclusive-software-product-as-a-team"
