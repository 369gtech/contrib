description: "In this session master Cat Herders' Fredrik Mörk and Benny Olsson will give you the run-down on the developers' view on security when facing ignorant users, function-oriented customers, and projects\nwith super-tight budgets. \n\nThere will be some laughs, some \"oh-no-you-didn't\"s, and, hopefully, some \"a-ha\"s and a handful of new ideas to take back home.\n\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry in the Malmö/Lund region. Foo Café is aimed at those interested in sharing, learning and creating. \nJoin the fun at foocafe.org"
