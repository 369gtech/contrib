description: 'We will demonstrate a deep learning framework to predict survival of lung cancer patients by using convolutional networks to learn high-dimensional representations of tumor phenotypes from multi-scale cancer data and clinical parameters. We evaluate our framework from three independent cohorts with survival data, and we show how the addition of clinical data improves performance. Furthermore, we describe how noise can improve the robustness of our model to delineation errors and introduce the concept of priming which helps improve performance when trained on one cohort and tested on another cohort.'
