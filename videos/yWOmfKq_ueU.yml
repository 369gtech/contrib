title: 'Can we do it without requirements - Kris Wnuk'
recordingDate: 1433246613
description: "This seminar will bring the details of Axis’ requirements process and discuss the important success factors of their approach. Moreover, the benefits and the challenges of the approach are explored, its scalability is examined and the viability of implementing a requirements database in the company's context is considered.\n\nRequirements knowledge is shared in other ways than documentation, e.g. through direct communication between colleagues. This approach is, for example, facilitated by the company’s culture and organization and yields many benefits and challenges. Currently, scalability does not seem to be a major challenge.\n\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry in the Malmö/Lund region. Foo Café is aimed at those interested in sharing, learning and creating. \nJoin the fun at foocafe.org"
