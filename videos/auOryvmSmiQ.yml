description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nAI inference on the Edge cloud using WebAssembly - Michael Yuan, Second State\n\nMichael Yuan will discuss options to run Tensorflow model inference on WebAssembly. Using a Mobilenet image classification task as an example, he will cover the plain JS approach, Tensorflow.js, pure Rust libraries for Tensorflow, and WASI-like Tensorflow extensions that run on specialized inference chips. The session will go through the journey of 60,000x performance gain over the evolution of WebAssembly. He will also discuss what’s the future for WebAssembly-based AI on the edge cloud."
