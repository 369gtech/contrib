description: 'With the rise of the mobile devices, the IoT ("Internet of Things") and all connected gadgets, home networks became a wild environment for all the family members. But the landscape is much broader and, today, developers must write code that will run on a multitude of different systems that do not offer the same flexibility as classic "computers". In this talk, I''ll explain why security is important and why we (infosec people and developers) need to work together. Then I''ll review some challenges that developers could face when developing on small hardware platforms and how to decrease the risks associated to them.'
