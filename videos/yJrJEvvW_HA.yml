title: 'SSL/TLS for Mortals by Maarten Mulders'
language: English
recordingDate: 1573162196
description: "Using SSL/TLS the right way is often a big hurdle for developers. We prefer to have that one colleague perform “something with certificates”, because he/she knows how that works.\n\nBut what if “that one colleague” is enjoying vacation and something goes wrong with the certificates? In this session we’ll take a close look at secure communication at the transport level.\n\nStarting with what exactly SSL and TLS is, we’ll dive into public/private keys, and signing. We’ll also learn what all this has to do with an unfortunate Dutch notary.\n\nOf course, there’ll be plenty of practical tips & trics, as well as demo’s. Attend this session to become “that one colleague”!\n\nPassionate architect, senior developer and trainer. Passionate about \"building the right thing\" and \"building the thing right\". Focusing on lean and elegant solutions. Love to share new ideas and knowledge. Outside work, I appreciate preparing and consuming good food, photography, and music, in no particular order."
