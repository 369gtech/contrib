description: "What if the code you’ve written accidentally excluded 25% of its users? Or what if it only worked 50% of the time for some people? These are the possible effects when we do not account for the diverse set of users when we are writing AI, ML and NLP code. While some effects may be comically embarrassing - like a smart speaker not accounting for the US’ southern accents; others can be deeply unfair to large groups of your users. Come with me on a journey to explore the importance of knowing your users, and building inclusive apps for a better world!\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
