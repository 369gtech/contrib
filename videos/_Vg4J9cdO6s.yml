recordingDate: 1571334401
description: "Understanding application behavior is important in any environment. The most efficient way to observe application behavior relies on metrics, key/value pairs of numerical data. Micrometer provides collector-agnostic APIs to help developers define and gather application metrics. This session will explore the capabilities of Micrometer, including examples of meter types and integration with different collectors like Prometheus or StatsD. We'll also explore how gathered data can be used in order to determine what should be measured.\n\nLearn more: http://micrometer.io/\n\nSpeakers: Erin Schnabel, Senior Technical Staff Member, IBM\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2019\nSlideShare: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/metrics-for-the-win-using-micrometer-to-understand-application-behavior/Pivotal/metrics-for-the-win-using-micrometer-to-understand-application-behavior"
