title: 'Interview with Matthias Buchner from Gemalto about a GWT app to manage smartcards'
language: English
recordingDate: 1269653178
description: "I met Matthias Buchner from Gemalto at the SXSW conference, and he showed me a very innovative GWT application.\r\nGemalto is using GWT to build a smartcard management app: they built a browser plugin that exposes the smartcard reader API to the developer in javascript, then developed a GWT library to use this API from a GWT app.\r\nOne innovative aspect of the app is that you can run it from a server, or as a desktop app, where you just run the javascript and html from the local file system."
