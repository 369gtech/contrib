description: "Code Mesh London is the best place in Europe for non-mainstream tech and programming languages. On 4-5 December 2013 over 50 inventors and originators of the most innovative languages and technologies of the moment shared their experience with 200 attendees. Topics included Scala, Haskell, Clojure, Erlang, Elixir, Julia and much more. See you at Code Mesh 2014! codemesh.io/\n\nAbout the talk:\nAs the industry awakens to the abuse of relational data modelling, the graph datastore arises as a compelling choice for many data needs. This may not be extremely obvious to those who have been raised in the RDBMS era, for use beyond modelling social networks. Even if you aren't working at Facebook or in a similar space (or even with jvm languages), there are many reasons you may want to look at a graph for your data needs, specifically Neo4j.\n\nIn this session I will discuss Neo4j, how it works, and when to use it. We'll talk about what makes it different from aggregate data stores and then look at the query language, Cypher. Hopefully by the end of this session you will see graph data stores as one of the tools for your polyglot persistence needs.\nTalk objectives\n\nIn this session I will discuss Neo4j, how it works, and when to use it.
