description: "This video was recorded at virtual Code BEAM V Europe conference, which took place on 19-21st May 2021 - https://codesync.global/conferences/code-beam-sto-2021/\n\nMore great virtual tech conferences - https://codesync.globalâ€‹ \n\n---\n\nKeynote: Fireside Chat on LiveView, the Future of Phoenix Web Development\nby Sophie DeBenedetto & Bruce Tate\n\nABSTRACT\nJoin Bruce Tate and Sophie DeBenedetto, authors of Programming Phoenix LiveView, for a fireside chat on LiveView and its impact on the future of web development. \n\nLiveView will change the way you develop single-page apps and increase Elixir and Phoenix adoption. It gives teams the ability to move fast while focusing brain power purely on the server-side, using the power of Elixir and Phoenix to support fault-tolerant single-page flows. \n\nBruce and Sophie will talk about some of the basic building blocks that make LiveView so powerful, including discussions of how LiveView lets you build complex interactive flows without writing any JavaScript, how this differs from traditional SPA development, what it's like to test LiveView, what the Surface component library brings to the table, and how you can design a beautiful, layered UI with one simple pattern. \n\nThis chat will be an interactive conversation not only between Sophie and Bruce, but also with you, the audience. Bring your LiveView questions so we can have a lively discussion about what LiveView brings to web development, and where it needs to go next.\n\n---\n\nSPEAKER - Sophie DeBenedetto\nSophie is an engineer at GitHub and co-author of Programming Phoenix LiveView. She is a graduate of, and former teacher at, The Flatiron School and has a passion for coding education. That passion, plus her love of Elixir, has also led her to become a maintainer of Elixir School, a free, open-source Elixir curriculum. She also participates in an Elixir mentoring program and is always seeking opportunities to help others learn and grow. Historically she is a cat person but will admit to owning a dog.\n\nSPEAKER - Bruce Tate\nBruce is a kayaker, climber, programmer and father of two from Chattanooga, Tennessee. A serial entrepreneur, he has helped start three companies and most recently served as CTO for icanmakeitbetter.\n\nThe author has more than a dozen books published in more than 10 countries. Bruce is active in the Elixir community as a speaker, author, editor and conference organizer. His love for teaching and computer languages led him to found Groxio in 2018.\n\n---\n\nCode BEAM V Europe\nWebsite: https://codesync.global/conferences/code-beam-sto-2021/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/CodeBEAMio"
