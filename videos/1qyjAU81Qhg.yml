description: "Riak is much more than just a database. In this webinar, we're joined by Heinz Gies, who will take a look at some the components that it is built with and how they work together. As the central part of Riak, he focuses on riak_core, and directly connected libraries and components.\n\nGiven the size of Riak's codebase and time limitations, this webinar is not an exhaustive examination but enough to allow us to understand the underlying concepts.\n\nHeinz uses this new found knowledge to take a look at DalmatinerDB. DalmatinerDB uses some of the same components but swaps out some others. He compares how those design choices can lead to different tradeoffs and a very different system as a result.\n\n\nWhat will you learn?\n* An idea of some of the components of riak(_core)\n* How databases built on Riak work internally\n* How they can be used to build new systems\n\nWEBINAR LIVE DATE: Thursday 22 February 2018 | 1800 CET / 1700 GMT / 1200 EST / 0900 PST\n\nDeck: https://www.slideshare.net/secret/gBNQfm9AufxWCT\n\n ——————————————————————— \n\n SPEAKER CONTACT DETAILS \n\nHEINZ GIES - A leading figure in the Riak community, Heinz is the mastermind behind DalmatinerDB, built on the riak_core for scalability and incredible resilience. Heinz is currently a technical wizard at Project FiFo. \n\nProject-FiFo offers open source smartOS cloud management and builds distributed systems on riak_core like the FiFo cloud management system or the DalmatinerDB metric database.\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/heinz_gies\nProject FiFo: https://project-fifo.net/\n\n ——————————————————————— \n\n COMPANY CONTACT DETAILS ERLANG SOLUTIONS \n\n- Website: https://www.erlang-solutions.com \n- Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/ErlangSolutions \n- LinkedIn: http://www.linkedin.com/company/erlan… \n- GitHub: https://github.com/esl"
