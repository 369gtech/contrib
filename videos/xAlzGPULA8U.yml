description: "From #Vilnius to #Mallorca! BUILD STUFF is going to celebrate summer! An amazing weekend on APRIL 29-30, 2017 – MALLORCA, SPAIN will take you out of the office into a seaside event full of professional lectures, technical sessions, beach games, umbrella drinks, and wonderful sunset. #buildstuffes #beachconference #code www.buildstuff.es\n\nMindaugas is a software developer, book reader, speaker, movie lover and an all-around geek. Most of the time these days he spends doing his darned best to help make second-hand the first choice worldwide as Head of Engineering at Vinted, the highest-valued startup in the Baltics.\\n\\nWhen he's not doing that, Mindaugas contributes a lot back to software development community. He has made significant contributions to open source with his own projects and improvements to existing ones. Mindaugas is also a frequent speaker at software development community events, sharing his personal experience and that of Vinted engineering team.\\n\\nPersonally, Mindaugas has a strong focus on self-­growth. During his earlier years, he was primarily driven to becoming a great writer of code. Eventually, it hit him that there’s more to being a software developer (and a human being) than slinging code."
