title: 'Zachary Kessin - Using Logic Programming Tools to Drive Property-based Testing'
language: English
recordingDate: 1409061887
description: "PBT with tools like QuickCheck and Proper are quite powerful, but building the models to test against is still probably the hardest part. I aim to use a Logic Programming tool (Kanrem or Prolog) to create the model and validate the results.\nTalk objectives:\n\nTo show how to use the powerful tools of logic programming and to how to build models to test Erlang code.\nTarget audience:\n\nThis will appeal to those who really enjoy programming languages and new tools."
