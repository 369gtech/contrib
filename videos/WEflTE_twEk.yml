description: "Clojure just celebrated its 11th birthday and it went a long way from being yet another Lisp into a complete and flourishing programming ecosystem. Today we have amazing tools built on top of Clojure's solid foundations: ClojureScript, Core.Async, Core.Spec, Transducers, Core.Logic, Tools.Analyzer and much more. \n\nIn this talk I want to explore what Clojure has to offer and illustrate how much power you can achieve once you embrace the power of Lisp."
