title: 'Using Clojurescript to launch iOS/Android apps to 1M users - Emin Hasanov (Lambda Days 2017)'
recordingDate: 1490361977
description: "http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2017/emin-hasanov\n\nStory of how a small company in Azerbaijan used ClojureScript + React Native to launch iOS/Android apps to its one million users in just 3 months and with only one mobile app developer.\n\nI will go through how we were able to quickly develop and iterate both iOS and Android versions at the same time, how we connected existing Rails app to provide a Transit API and how we use CodePush to provide over-the-air updates without going through app stores. \n\nThis will be a practical talk, with code examples and description of real problems and how they can be solved."
