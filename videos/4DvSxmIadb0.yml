description: "Did you master all of C++? Learnt all the features, read all the proposals and crave for more?\n\nThis is the talk for you and everybody who is just curious to learn some complementary features.\n\nMany attempts were tried to defeat C++ with new languages, but C++ is only getting stronger.\n\nNew C++ features are sometimes a bit late, but we learnt by the success and mistakes of the other languages.\n\nThat way we got the fastest and best lambda implementation.\n\nIn this talk, I will collect desirable features of other programming languages and frameworks.\n\nThe goal is not to create new C++ proposals, but to understand the potentials and try them with current C++."
