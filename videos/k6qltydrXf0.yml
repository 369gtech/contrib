description: "\"There is no cloud, it's just someone else's computer\". Maybe you heard that joke, and of course it's true. But of course when that someone is Microsoft, and the computers are thousands and thousands of servers, people start paying attention. In this presentation, Laurent Bugnion, a Microsoft Azure Cloud Advocate will guide your first steps into the cloud. We'll discover some key cloud services, see how you can deploy your code easily, and understand what tools can be used to manage the remote infrastructure. The cloud can be scary at first, but we'll take you by the hand and guide you step by step.\n\nAzure Fundamentals: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/azure-fundamentals/?WT.mc_id=8397-SDC-8397-Laurent.Bugnion"
