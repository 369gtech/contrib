description: 'In a tribute to Romero''s masterpiece, we will examine the resurgence of vulnerabilities we all thought dead. As soon as a security expert looks at the firmware and code of IoT devices, 2017 may as well be 1997: format string bugs, basic stack overflows and hardcoded credentials arise. Zero-days are actually forever-days. We will look at a number of real world cases of industrial and consumer IoT devices we tested and broke, and besides analyzing the most common and most outstanding findings, we will wonder why we seem unable to kill these pests once and forever.'
