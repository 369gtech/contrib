description: "In this talk, Patrick Kua explores the breadth of skills and experience an architect requires and the balance of traits that makes a well-rounded architect. He also explores some of the failure modes when an architect focuses too much on a single aspect at the cost of others, and the impact it has on teams and organisations. HE concludes by exploring a conceptual model to help assess, learn and maintain the balanced set of skills to become a well-rounded architect in a modern team.\n\nThe global dev community meets at WeAreDevelopers, an event dubbed by many as the “Woodstock of Developers”.
