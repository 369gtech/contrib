description: "Observers are an awesome (though maybe under appreciated) feature of Polymer that let you react to property changes in your JavaScript. With observers you can watch a single property, subproperties, multiple properties, or even toss in a wildcard to monitor multiple subproperties all at the same time! Crazy awesome!\n\nPolycasts playlist: https://goo.gl/r5fsMq \nPolymer Slack: http://bit.ly/polymerslack\n \n\nSubscribe to the Chrome Developers channel: https://goo.gl/OUF4e2\n\nLike the music in the endcard?
