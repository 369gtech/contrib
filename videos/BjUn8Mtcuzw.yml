Hopefully not frequently — but they do. Sometimes they are small, other times big. Sometimes they can be existential crises that can leave deep professional scars.\n\nThis talk describes such a mistake — by the person who made it — and how the person and the organization recovered and grew from it.\n\nThis keynote is sponsored by EdgeCast, now part of Verizon.\n\nAbout Will Pressly (EdgeCast):\nWill Pressly is a Principal Engineer at Verizon EdgeCast. Pressly leads the team that authors, maintains and operates all DNS and Load Balancer code for EdgeCast’s CDNs and its DNS Product, Route.
