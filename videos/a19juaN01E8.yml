title: 'Reverse Engineering a Bluetooth Lightbulb - Jesse Phelps'
recordingDate: 1533199328
description: "I recently made build lights for the company I work for and my home office. They integrate with TeamCity and indicate when a build is running and success/failure of all the tests.\nIn this session, we will reverse engineer a bluetooth light bulbâ€™s protocol, learn how to have an Intel Edison communicate with the bulb, and by the end you too will know how to make your own build lights! Please note that this talk will be highly technical. We will be discussing low level details of bluetooth communication, protocol analysis with Wireshark, sniffing bluetooth packets, etc."
