description: "Slides and more info:  http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2016/claudia-doppioslash\n\nHow to connect Elm on a Web client with Erlang on a Server in in a lightweight and low latency way using Websockets?  Don't want to have to pull in a whole Web Framework for this?  Now you can get use Elmer to just make your Elm front-end talk to your Erlang processes.\n\nThe use case shown is the start of a Web-IDE for a PLC component running on a embedded system written in Erlang.\n\nPLCs are used to control everything from a simple garage door opener to complex industry transport system for manufacturing.   Traditionally they are programmed with a variety of graphical and textual languages using a IDE.   To be able to develop and debug such systems it is necessary to get realtime information about the internal variables and state of the actual embedded system.\n\nWe will give a short overview of Elm and how it fits well to the application domain, show how the Websocket communication was added to Elms internals and will demo the communication between Erlang and Elm."
