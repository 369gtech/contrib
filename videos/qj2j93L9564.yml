description: "SREcon17 Americas - So You Want to Be a Wizard\n\nJulia Evans, Stripe\n\nI don't always feel like a wizard. Like many of you, I've been doing operations for a couple of years, and I still have a TON TO LEARN about how to do this \"SRE\" job.\n\nBut along the way, I have learned a few ways to debug tricky problems, get the information I need from my colleagues, and get my job done. We're going to talk about\n\n• how asking dumb questions is actually a superpower\n• how you can read the source code to the Linux kernel when all else fails\n• debugging tools that make you FEEL like a wizard\n• how understanding what your _organization_ needs can make you amazing\n\nAt the end, we'll have a better understanding of how you can get a lot of awesome stuff done even when you're not the highest level wizard on your team.\n\nJulia Evans is a developer who works on infrastructure at Stripe. She likes making programs go fast and learning how to debug weird problems. She thinks you can be a wizard programmer.\n\nView the SREcon17 Americas Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon17americas/program"
