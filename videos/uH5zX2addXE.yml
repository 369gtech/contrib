description: '003 Before we start to write our first component in React, we want to link our local project to a repository on GitHub so itâ€™s easier to keep track of it, share or collaborate. A good tip coming from a decade of SEO experience where we present data to the user in the most efficient way, I suggest writing the name of the folders and files using hyphens and all lower case to separate words. Naming a file PlayVideoList only makes sense in JavaScript, and JavaScript has nothing to do with the operating system and naming files. You can look as many times as you want to PlayVideoList and play-video-list, the later one will always be easier to read.'
