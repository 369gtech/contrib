description: "Spring I/O 2018 - Barcelona, 24-25 May\n\nSpring Boot, the convention-over-configuration centric framework from the Spring team at Pivotal, marries Spring’s flexibility with conventional, common sense defaults to make application development on the JVM not just fly, but pleasant! Spring Boot aims to make address the common functional and non-functional requirements that gate quickly moving to production. The framework is as clean as it gets, wouldn’t it be nice if the language matched its elegance?\n\nKotlin, the productivity-focused language from our friends at JetBrains, takes up the slack to make the experience leaner, cleaner and even more pleasant!\n\nThe Spring and Kotlin teams have worked hard to make sure that Kotlin and Spring Boot are a first-class experience for all developers trying to get to production, faster and safer.\n\nIn this talk, Josh and Sébastien will live code a Spring Boot 2 + Kotlin application to show you concretely how efficient and fun coding can be when using these 2 technologies together."
