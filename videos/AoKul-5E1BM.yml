description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nImplementation Challenges: From HPC to Containers in the Academy - Lukáš Hejtmánek & Viktória Spišaková, Masaryk University\n\nContainer computing does not have a lengthy history in the academic environment. Traditionally, HPC holds the first place because of high resource availability, direct multi-tenancy support, and researchers having legacy experience. This session will introduce efforts made at the CERIT-SC/Institute of Computer Science of Masaryk University to implement Kubernetes infrastructure and move scientific computing to containers. We will present challenges of multi-tenancy assurance, deploying applications under users, resource sharing, and building trust towards containerization among the research community. We will discuss several created solutions, present a couple of European open-source projects and demonstrate how containers help in the academic environment. Furthermore, we present other issues we fight and propose ideas on new features."
