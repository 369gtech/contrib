title: 'DEF CON 29 Cloud Village - Rod Soto - Detection Challenges in Cloud Connected Credential  Attacks'
language: English
recordingDate: 1631397890
description: 'With the widespread adoption of cloud technologies, many companies are now managing environments where the line between the perimeter and the internet is blurred. This presentation outlines the challenges defenders face in the light of the implementation of new technologies that enable users to operate seamlessly between the cloud and the perimeter. A “converged” perimeter brings new attacks such as Golden SAML, Pass The SAML, Oauth Token Hijacking which are some of the manifestations of current and future challenges in these types of environments. Presenters will propose a new approach based on current attack research and new defense posture, with specific detections developed to address these new threats.'
