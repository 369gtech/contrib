description: "A lot of things have been developed over the last 15 years that should make the process of making a browser easier. In this talk we will explore a bunch of different tools, platforms and libraries that could go into making a browser in 2020.\n\nWe will also see a live demo of a simple browser built with these OSS projects. We will also discuss the limitations and future work needed to make this work in practice.\n\nCheck out more of our talks at: \nhttps://ndctechtown.com/\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/"
