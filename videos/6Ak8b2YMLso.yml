description: "Time to rock! Staying enthusiastic about your art and design is not entirely about finding new clients, nor is it about the changing industry. We need inspiration, entertainment, progression, a solid bridge between conceptual and technical, and a positive outlook on our place in the design universe. \r\n\r\nIn this recorded session from FITC Toronto 2011, James White discusses the ins and outs of selling your personal artwork online and the adventure of building a line of designer t-shirts and posters. He also presents the lessons learned from running his Signalnoise Design Studio for the past five years and how he went about creating his name in the design industry.\r\n\r\nThanks to our video sponsor Vitamin T for making this possible.
