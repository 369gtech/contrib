title: 'DEF CON 29 Biohacking Village - Thom Dixon - Securing the Internet of Biological Things'
language: English
recordingDate: 1632543299
description: 'The coming age of robust two-way communication between living and non-living systems can simply be described as the Internet of Biological Things (IoBT). Interfacing optoelectronic systems with optogenetic-, bioelectrochemical- and biosensor-based information substrates will challenge key assumptions underpinning information security. A cyberbiosecurity mindset is needed to maximise the benefits and minimise the downsides of the pervasive, persistent and immersive information environment that arises from an IoBT world.'
