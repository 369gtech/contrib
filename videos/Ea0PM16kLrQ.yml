description: "Held on August 28 2018\n\nClick on SHOW MORE for video highlights! In our August session, Mark Scardina welcomed Barry Gleeson who was responsible for architecting the Oracle Database Quality of Service Management feature that provides operational runtime autonomous performance management of Oracle RAC databases. Questions ranged across the full gambit of design, functionality and best practices.\n\n01:55 - What is Oracle’s goal in developing QoS Management?\n03:02 - What collection of servers and databases does a QoS Management instance manage?\n04:10 - How does QoS Management define and measure Response Times?\n05:40 -  What types of actions does QoSM recommend to help maintain Response Time Objectives when there is a load surge?\n10:17 - What actions will QoSM recommend when load is so large that all Response Time Objectives cannot be met at the same time?\n12:10 - What does QoSM do when a Response Time problem is detected, but none of the available Actions helps or is appropriate?\n15:20 - Since you can rank workloads how can I manage them when their rankings change – ex: weekdays and weekends?\n18:32  - Can these policies be switched on a schedule automatically? \n19:15 - What type of user interfaces does QoS Management support?\n21:00 - What QoS Management functionality is in Oracle Enterprise Manager?\n23:17 - Is having QoSM managing the DB resources the only benefit of this product?\n31:50 - What is the best practice to make use of QoSM modes?\n36:22 - Does QoS Management require any specific database deployment?\n38:10 - For QoS, we are evaluated SQL that is already running. Is there a way to prevent new SQL from being fired if system is already overloaded?\n39:55 - How about using a (custom defined) function to perform consumer group mapping?\n42:22 - The problem we are facing is the module/action are dynamic generated. Can we use a custom defined function to generate the list?\n44:28 - What if module and action are from URL endpoint? \n43:44 - Does QoSM support wildcard matches, more advance mapping like regexp or even from a table that I can provide the list? \n46:45 - Which versions of Oracle databases does QoS Management support?\n48:15 - Can you also cover new feature QoS (ORM) added in 18c before we end today?\n49:50 - How does QoS Management specifically support classifying requests into Performance Classes? \n50:15 - What is the overhead of using QoS Management?\n52:38 - How do I change service during a session?\n54:51 - Does QoS Management negatively affect an application’s availability?\n56:00 - What happens should the QoS Management Server fail?\n57:18 - Are there any limitations on the types of applications that Oracle QoS Management can measure and monitor?\n59:18 - Are there any limitations on the types of workloads that Oracle QoS Management can manage?\n\nAskTOM Office Hours offers free, monthly training and tips on how to make the most of Oracle Database, from Oracle product managers, developers and evangelists.\n\nhttps://asktom.oracle.com/\n\nOracle Developers portal: https://developer.oracle.com/\nSign up for an Oracle Cloud trial: https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/tryit\n\n\nmusic: bensound.com"
