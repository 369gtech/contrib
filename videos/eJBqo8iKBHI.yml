description: "What if there was a way you could take advantage of the latest microservice architectures by leveraging the developers and skills you already have?!? In this session we’ll show you how with Eclipse MicroProfile and Red Hat’s implementation Thorntail. We discuss all the cool features it allows you to easily use, such as OpenTracing, Metrics, and layout the current roadmap plans.\n\nThen we move onto a demo that showcases what’s possible with Eclipse MicroProfile, utilizing the existing specifications, built with Thorntail. We will develop a microservice that integrates all the specifications. By the end of the session the attendee will have a better understanding of Eclipse MicroProfile, and how to develop to it with Thorntail.\n\nVoxxed Days Microservices 2018: 2 days conference (+1 optional workshops day) only on Microservices. \n\nFollow us on :\nWebsite : https://voxxeddays.com/microservices (bit.ly/vxdmicro)\nTwitter : https://twitter.com/vxdmicroservice\nLinkedin : https://www.linkedin.com/in/voxxed-days-microservices-906115164\nKeep in touch : https://t.co/pxf7cHZOpl\n\n#developers #conference #microservices"
