recordingDate: 1635891048
description: 'Android Automotive OS is a version of Android tailored for In-Vehicle Infotainment (IVI) â€“ navigation, vehicle status, audio, and more. The first car to use AAOS is the Polestar 2. In this presentation I will talk about the changes Google have made to Android to make it ready for the road. There is a a new hardware abstraction layer that allows applications to access the vehicle bus in a controlled way. There are changes to the Android audio subsystem to handle the complexities multiple input and output channels. And, there is a new sub system to handle the rear view cameras. Amongst other things, I will be asking: how does a car differ from a smartphone? What are the consequences of running a consumer operating system in the IVI head unit? Which parts are open source and which proprietary? Come along to find answers'
