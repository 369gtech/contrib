description: "Driving DevOps at Global Scale\n\nBrian Timmeny, Head of DevOps & Engineering Processes, BBVA\n\nIn this presentation, Brian Timmeny, currently serving as Head of Global DevOps and Digital Transformation at BBVA, will explain the restart/continuation of the BBVA transformation journey. Within the first attempt at the agile journey yielded less than optimal results (to improve the speed of delivery). Within the most recent iteration of this transformation, BBVA is now concurrently focused on transforming both the cultural and processes, along with the technology enablement suites to drive a full scale transformation. \n\nThis journey has begun with a focus on how to sustainably transform a large organization over time to a culture of continuous learning and constant improvement. The initial establishment of seed talent within regional hubs served as the launch point to set up local (by geography, country) delivery centers of excellence, and side-by-side delivery talent to drive both the top down and bottom up transformation required to execute at the organizational scale of BBVA. These delivery organizations were then cemented together through the use of execution communities, with a focus on cross-sharing cultural and technology wins, and fostering at at-scale support group to assist and balance regional and global transformation consistency. Driving learnings and wins from regional teams through an “incrementing pilots program” has catapulted BBVA’s delivery organization to the next level of transformation.\n\nBrian will explain the BBVA journey over the past two years, including the stops and restarts that have led to the current transformation model which has exponentially accelerated the BBVA transformation, driving capabilities at an ever-increasing pace. The baseline focus of this presentation will remain focused on BBVA’s use of continuous learnings and improvement of the transformation model itself that has translated to the manner in which BBVA now looks to its associates to drive transformation within the fabric of our culture. This is not a point-in-time transformation. Transformation is contestant, and BBVA’s drive toward this culture has been, and will remain, pivotal to the organization’s success in the immediate and long term future.\n\nDOES17 London\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/eur/"
