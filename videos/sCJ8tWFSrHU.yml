description: "Google Tech Talks\r\nMarch 24, 2009\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nTechnology plays a role in baseball from the game on the field to the business and team operations in the front office. Find out how the San Francisco Giants use technology in game-related functions and business areas.\r\n\r\nHear about the Giants plans to experiment with dynamic pricing during 2009. The Giants are trying something new with ticket sales in a few tough-to-sell upper-deck outfield sections of AT Park for 2009: cost based on demand.\r\n\r\n\"We're going to experiment with this a little bit in a few sections of the park,\" team President Larry Baer said. \"What this really is, is the ticket business is changing dramatically and quickly. There's a chance we might wake up 10 years from now and tickets will be priced according to demand, like the airlines. We'll see how it works and how the fans like it. This would be a first. We have innovative people in our ticket office.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3740092\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/article/60741\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeaker: Larry Baer\r\nA fourth generation San Franciscan with impeccable credentials in the world of sports management, television, film and politics, Larry Baer has gained a national reputation as one of professional sports' leading visionaries.
