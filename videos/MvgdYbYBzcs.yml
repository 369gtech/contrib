description: "What if payments were natively supported in the browser? This is the goal of W3C’s Web Payments Working Group first deliverable: the Payment Request API.\n\nNow implemented in most major browsers and with the Payment Handler API on its way, you’ll never think of payments on the web the same way. We want that by the end of this presentation, you not only know how to accept payments on the web through the Payment Request API, but would be able to code your very own payment method through the Payment Handler API.\n\nLet’s spread the knowledge around Payment Request and Payment Handlers, killing the checkout as we know it, forever."
