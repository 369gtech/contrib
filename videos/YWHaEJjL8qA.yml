description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2013\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nRuss Miles - Co-Author of Head First Software Development\n\nABSTRACT\nComplexity is the silent killer of productivity in software development. An unnecessarily complex solution can result in an order of magnitude larger problem for system evolution, even to the point of bringing a solution's development to a halt as 'it has just become too complex to develop further'. \n In this talk Russ Miles, principal consultant with Simplicity Itself, will share the story of how he helped architect, design and implement a flexible and highly integrated real-world solution that was drastically simplified by using events. \nEvent Driven Architectures are often associated with complexity (we even have 'Complex Event Processing' as a technique and toolset to manage this supposed complexity) but with the patterns and tools introduced in this talk Russ will attempt to show how this is not a case of intrinsic complexity but rather something we accidentally introduce and can avoid. \nUsing an implementation technology-agnostic approach, this talk will cover: \n  - What is architectural simplicity and why is it crucially important \n  - Tradoffs of simplicity vs. complexity when buying flexibility. What to barter with, and what to avoid. \n  - How to think differently about your architecture, its integration challenges & its evolution over time using the Life Preserver pattern & tool. \n  - How to design simple events and domains. \n  - How to apply these patterns to your daily architectural decision-making processes.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
