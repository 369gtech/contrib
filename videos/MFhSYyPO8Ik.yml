language: English
recordingDate: 1433231847
description: "Managing application infrastructure is not what developers want to spend time figuring out. The challenge of quickly automating facets of application development such as database infrastructure setup is still present in many cloud application projects. This session introduces developers to current cloud services (private and public clouds, terminology, service types, OpenStack) and relevant Java SDKs. This includes discussing the advantages of using open source, portable, and provider-agnostic solutions versus more-closed systems. The session describes the high-level jclouds architecture and presents and runs code examples showing how to manage cloud-based database infrastructure with OpenStack Trove.\n\n\nAuthor:\nZahari Shoylev\nZack Shoylev is a committer on the Apache jclouds project and a Software Developer for Rackspace. He is currently working on open source cloud SDK development. Zackâ€™s technical interests focus on open source development, cloud computing, and big data processing with Java. Zack has previously presented at JavaOne and ApacheCon.\nView more trainings by Zahari Shoylev at https://www.parleys.com/author/zahari-shoylev\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
