description: "Over ?75,000,000, 3 PCFs, 2 IaaSs, 1 Night - The Comic Relief Story - Marie Cosgrove-Davies, Pivotal; Zenon Hannick, Comic Relief; Benedict Dodd, Armakuni; Jay Marshall, Google; & Evan Willey, Pivotal    \n\nWhat happens when an entire country decides to exercise your app at the same moment? How do you architect an app, platform and IaaS where a second of downtime results in thousands of pounds of missed donations.\n\nThis was the challenge we faced to support the 2017 Comic Relief charity drive. The campaign is aiming to raise over £100 million and culminates in a 7 hour BBC telethon on March 24th. \n\nCome and hear from Comic Relief (customer), Armakuni (app developer), Pivotal (operator), and GCP (IaaS provider) talk about the challenges and solutions faced in preparing for and supporting the 2017 Comic Relief event.\n\nEvan Willey\nPivotal\nEvan is the Director of Program Management for Pivotal Cloud Foundry. He enjoys scaling agile organizations and telling dad jokes.\n\nMarie Cosgrove-Davies\nPivotal\nProduct Manager, CloudOps\nGreater Pittsburgh Area\nLinkedIn Connect\nMarie is a product manager for Pivotal’s CloudOps teams in the EU and SF. CloudOps supports EU-PWS (the environment that supported Comic Relief’s fundraising), Pivotal Tracker's PCF, and the open-to-the-public US-PWS (run.pivotal.io). In her spare time, she reads far too many books and works on her century-old house to ensure her cats can maintain the lifestyles to which they’ve become accustomed.\n\nBen Dodd\nArmakuni\nBen was a founding member of Armakuni, a company originally formed to transform the way Comic Relief ensure every penny is collected on their riskiest night of the year. Having run the event every year since, he continues to partner with the best and brightest in the Cloud Foundry community to ensure Comic Relief can concentrate on raising money and not worrying about technology being a limiting factor in its mission for a vision of a just world, free from poverty.\n\nZenon Hannick\nComic Relief\nCTO\nLondon\nWebsitecomicrelief.com\nZenon has worked in many different technology roles across financial services, startups and the third sector. As CTO he is leading an ambitious change program to bring technology and digital to the centre of the whole organisation. At Comic Relief he previously led the rebuild of the On The Night Donations platform to allow for peaks of 500 concurrent donations a second in order to facilitate the collection of millions of pounds during the Red Nose Day and Sport Relief TV shows.\n\nJay Marshall\nGoogle\nJay Marshall is part of the Solutions Engineering team at Google Cloud, and is an ex-Pivotal Field Engineer/early Cloud Foundry obsessor. He currently focuses on helping developers and enterprises build on top of Google’s massive global footprint of cloud infrastructure and services known as Google Cloud Platform. Jay is a lifetime wannabe musician and spends much of his free time recording music that no one else listens to."
