description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM SF 2020 - http://bit.ly/2wpn0SM\n\nGet involved in Code Sync's next conference - https://codesync.global\n\n---\n\nTHE YIN AND YANG OF MUTABILITY\nby Péter Gömöri\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nmutability\n\nTALK LEVEL: Intermediate users\n\nABSTRACT\nIn the footsteps of Erik Stenman and Michal Muskala, let's explore another part of the BEAM VM. The two extremes of mutability: atomic counters and persistent terms were introduced without much ado, almost secretly in the patch release OTP 21.2. Via an example using them in an hdr histogram implementation, I'd like to explore their behaviour, caveats and limitations. And also show some benchmarks for scenarios when \"you have to measure\".\n\nSlides & full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/peter-goemoeri/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - PÉTER GÖMÖRI\nBEAM Enthusiast, XProf maintainer\n\nPeter spent quite a few years at Ericsson where he became an Erlang native. Later he utilised his experience in various other industries from sports-betting to online advertisement at Erlang Solutions. Recently, he has joined Appliscale to fight with cloud-scale systems.\n\nMore on Peter Gomori: https://codesync.global/speaker/peter-goemoeri/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM SF 2020\nCode BEAM SF is powered by Code Sync.
