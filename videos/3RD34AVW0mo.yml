description: "Teaching yourself to code or do anything new outside of your comfort zone is hard. This talk outlines what the journey could look like, how you can build on the small pieces (classes) that get you to your first milestone and lessons learned that could be helpful to others who are teaching themselves to program or who are undertaking something new and beyond their comfort zone. The talk provides detailed examples of ideas and experiments anyone can try on their next learning journey. \n\nOn a high level, some of the lessons learned are: \n\n1. Forward progress is key \n2. Follow your curiosity \n3. It takes initiative \n4. It's not you, it's hard \n5. Open source your journey\n\nSpeaker: Neha Batra, Pivotal"
