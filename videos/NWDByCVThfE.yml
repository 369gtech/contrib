description: "http://g.co/gtac2013\nSlides: http://goo.gl/pOSkp\n\nIgor Dorovskikh and Kaustubh Gawande, Expedia\n\nExpedia started investing in Mobile Web and iOS/Android apps in early 2012. At the same time Test Engineers started developing test automation solutions to build quality and testability into the products from the beginning. In this talk, we will share our experience and learning of utilizing open source tools to build automated testing in Expedia's Agile development and continuous delivery environment. We will talk about Test Pyramid and go into more detail of specific open source tools that have worked well for us. Some of the open source tools we use are BDD tools such as Cucumber, web automation tool Selenium-WebDriver, iOS automation tool Frank, Android automation tools Robotium and Calabash, and Continuous Integration system Jenkins. In addition, we will share some of the Agile delivery principles we strive to adopt like TDD, Pair Programming, Build and Test Radiators. Finally, we will share some of the benefits we have realized from our investment in Agile and test automation and how that is getting us to our Continuous Delivery goals."
