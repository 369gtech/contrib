description: "Hi Spring fans! Welcome to another installment of [_Spring Tips_ (@SpringTipsLive)](http://twitter.com/SpringTipsLive)! In this installment we look at the _just-landed_ community contribution in Spring Batch adding support for Apache Kafka. This new support offers some tantalizing opportunities to bridge batch and streaming workloads. Stage large writes to backend warehouses with Kafka and drain the stream with Spring Batch. Load large amounts of data from existing datastores and funnel it into stream processing pipelines. And the possibilities become even more interesting when you consider Spring Integration, Spring Cloud Stream, Spring Cloud Stream Kafka Streams, and Spring Cloud Data Flow. If you want a quick primer on Spring Batch-basics you might like the Spring Tip installment on Spring Batch from - _gasp_! - two years ago!\n\nspeaker: Josh Long (@starbuxman) \ntwitter:    http://twitter.com/Starbuxman"
