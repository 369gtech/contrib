description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nDiscussion & Comments: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2019\n—\nC++ is a success story. One reason is its backward compatibility.\nBut that also makes C++ more or more unteachable.\nToo many features, too many rules, too many inconsistences.\n\nSo, the only solution (beside clean-ups for simple rules) are good style guides.\nHowever, these style guides contradict significantly.\nFor example, while some recommend to define operations as non-member non-friend,\nothers recommend to use hidden friends.\nOr when should we define virtual destructors?\nOr the details of the rule of 0, 3, 5, \"5 or 3\".\nOr how to initialize an object.\n\nI have no clear solution.\nBut it's time to open the stage for a consolidation of the situation.\nAt least in the interest of all the average programmers who do not know all the rules (well, yes, nobody does).\n— \nNicolai Josuttis\nIT Communication\n\nNicolai Josuttis (http://www.josuttis.com) is an independent system architect, technical manager, author, and consultant.
