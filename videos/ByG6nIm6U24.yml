title: 'Debug C++ Without Running - Anastasiia Kazakova [C++ on Sea 2019]'
recordingDate: 1550319282
description: "Macros, templates, compile-time evaluation and code generation, reflection and metaclasses – C++ tends to hide the final code passed to the compiler under the tons of various names and aliases. Add here the preprocessor that shadows the actual running curve of your program with dozens of alternatives mixed in a non-trivial way. While this allows to avoid boilerplate code and reduce copy-paste and other errors, such an approach demands better tooling support to make the debugging process easier.\n\nTo find an error in such a code, one has to continuously read-fix-run it and compare the results with some etalon, or to debug in order to find actual substitutions. But should you really wait until your code is run or even compiled to debug it? Or how to deal with the situations when the code can’t be run on the local machine? A text editor with code completion won’t help, while a smart IDE that “gets” your code can do a better job.\n\nIn this talk we’ll see interesting approaches to solving cases like macro and typedef ‘debug’, understanding types when auto/decltype hide them, dealing with different code branches depending on the preprocessor’s pass-through, and other ideas. The aim of this talk is to share the workflows supported by the tools that can help C++ developers create better modern C++ code.\n---\nAs a C and C++ software developer, Anastasia Kazakova created real-time *nix-based systems and pushed them to production for 8 years. She has a passion for networking algorithms and embedded programming and believes in good tooling. With all her love for C++, she is now the Product Marketing Manager on the JetBrains CLion team. Besides, Anastasia runs a C++ user group in Saint-Petersburg, Russia.\n\nhttps://cpponsea.uk/sessions/debug-cpp-without-running.html\n\nFilmed and Edited by Digital Medium Ltd: https://events.digital-medium.co.uk\nEnquiries: events@digital-medium.co.uk"
