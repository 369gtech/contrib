recordingDate: 1475913650
description: "File Systems are pretty convenient, but can have surprising and subtle behaviours. In this talk we will look at file systems and their APIs from the perspective of a database. And then we will explore implementing our own file system tailored to our needs.\n\nSpeaker\nChris Vest is a System Engineer at Neo Technology, working on the Neo4j database engine. He specialises in IO and concurrency, and other low-level details, and generally tries to keep the dragons on the right side of the Here Be Dragons sign.\n\n---------------------------------\n\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry in the Malmö/Lund region. Foo Café is aimed at those interested in sharing and learning.\n\nBorn out of the desire to create a year round conference like atmosphere, Foo Café is THE place for planned and spontaneous meetings of all sizes and interests within the IT arena.\nEnjoy a coffee or a cold beer, along with light pub fare, and engage with other like minded individuals interested in sharing their knowledge and learning from one another. Foo Café is sourced by individuals, small, medium and goliath-sized enterprises, as well as entrepreneurs. Awaiting you, after stepping over the Foo Café threshold, is a space that is recruitment and product placement safe!\n\nWe look forward to igniting inspiration and creativity year round to patrons of Foo Café."
