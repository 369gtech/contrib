recordingDate: 1493344257
description: "With Drupal being used for building websites and applications in government, non-profits, and corporate enterprises, it has become important to make sure that production projects follow mandated security controls. Guardr is a distribution that will kickstart your project with community selected and supported modules and configurations to strengthen Drupal security.\n\nGuardr maintainers have worked with the security departments of corporations, U.S. banks, and the U.S. Federal Government, combining security standards to not only pick out some great hardening modules, but also to configure them during install with hardened settings. Why download and configure individual modules when Guardr can do the heavy-lifting for you?\n\nSession attendees will learn about Guardr's philosophy, features, and how to start new projects with Guardr. Let's raise the bar on Drupal security with a more streamlined approach.\n\n\n\n\nSession Outline\n\nWhat is Guarder?\nThe Guardr philosophy and how modules are selected for inclusion\nWhat to expect when Guardr is installed\nWhy use Guardr?\nCIA information security triad\nHow Guardr goes beyond just including security related modules\nSecurity features in Guardr:\nAutomatically logout users after a specified period of time\nSession limits\nMonitoring server disk utilization\nData encryption options\nSet password policies\nReset all user passwords\nMonitor for hacked modules\nExtended logging of logins\nContent Security Policy modifications\nSSL/TLS, clickjacking, user enumeration, cross-site request forgery, and cross-site scripting protection enhancements\nDemonstrations\nHow to get involved and contribute"
