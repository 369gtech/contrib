description: 'Up until now, if we had to choose a language for low-level stuff we will often go with C or C++. Now we have a third option: Rust, a systems programming language designed for safe memory manipulation, providing high-level tools for low-level development and also used in the web for high-performance HTTP servers or web assembly. The talk will give an overview of the problems Rust allows to solve better and how to start with it.'
