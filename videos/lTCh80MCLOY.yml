title: 'Why your company needs an internal API and what you should do about it - Glenn F. Henriksen'
language: English
recordingDate: 1624881054
description: "A problem for many companies is that their information and processes is locked down in various software systems. Integrations are hard, often duplicated and multiplied by the number of systems. Changing core systems directly is slow, costly and hard. The complexity increases exponentially and slows the rate of innovation.\n\nCreating a company service platform on top of these core systems can allow for a simpler and faster way of innovating and experimenting. How do we ascend to this Nirvana? By good old-fashioned development. By doing the hard work only once and building services that exposes more and more parts of the internal systems and processes. Iâ€™ll show you the why and the how, enabling you to create a robust, scalable and secure service platform for your business."
