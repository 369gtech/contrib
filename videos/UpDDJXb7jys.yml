description: "Emil Mikulic, OpenCensus\n\nApplication metrics and distributed traces are immensely powerful for developers, but are difficult to automatically retrieve. Based off of the same technology used at Google, OpenCensus is an open source project that aims to make the collection and submission of app metrics and traces easier for developers.\n\nIn this talk you will learn about:\n\nThe benefits of traces and metrics, and how we use them at Google\nThe case for a common instrumentation implementation\nAn architectural overview of OpenCensus, including integrations and exporters\nIntrospection via z-pages\nOur vision of the future for instrumentation\nWhile the Census project originates from Google, it has evolved into an open source collaboration between multiple cloud and APM vendors and the OSS community, and already supports Prometheus, Zipkin, Stackdriver, and SignalFx.\n\nSee opencensus.io for more details.\n\nView the full SREcon18 Asia/Australia Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon18asia/program\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
