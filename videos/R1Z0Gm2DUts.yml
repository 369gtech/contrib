The threat posed by technological unemployment is not something that's just years down the road however. It's already here and the effects can be observed all around us. Furthermore, in a sane society, technological advances would not be something to fear, but something to embrace, by benefiting all members of society. In order for this to happen, the productivity gains of technology must be shared universally and unconditionally. For reasons that will be made clear for those listening, the idea of a basic income is not only an effective way to accomplish this critical goal, it's an absolutely necessary idea to implement immediately in nation after nation around the world in order to create a better present and future for all of human civilization.\n\nKey takeaways\nTechnological unemployment is real.\nTechnological unemployment is not something we should fear.\nIn order to not fear technological unemployment\nThe best way to decouple income from work is with unconditional basic income.\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
