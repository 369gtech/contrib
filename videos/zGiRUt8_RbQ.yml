description: "Speaker(s):\nBrett Lider; David Singleton\n\nDescription:\nMost of the time, your phone is in your pocket with the screen turned off. If you want to do anything with it, there's always those first few steps of getting it out and waking it up. Android WearÕs new platform feature, always-on, allows you to stay in an app for as long as you need it. This transforms the watch into whatever app you happen to be using: a map, a shopping list, a fitness coach Ð the possibilities are endless. In this session, you'll learn how to design and build for the new capabilities and opportunities that always-on screens provide.\n\nWatch all Google I/O 2015 videos at: g.co/dev/io15videos.\n\n#io15"
