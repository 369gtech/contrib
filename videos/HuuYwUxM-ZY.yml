description: "Speaker: Allison Kaptur\n\nWrestling bugs can be one of the most frustrating parts of programming - but with the right framing, bugs can also be our best allies. I'll tell the tales of two of my favorite bugs, including the time I triggered a DDOS of a logging cluster, and explain why I love them. I'll also give you concrete strategies for approaching tricky bugs and making them easier and more fun.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2018 and https://github.com/PyCon/2018-slides"
