description: "Are you writing mixed-language applications that call native code from Java? The Oracle Solaris Studio IDE is based on NetBeans and works on any Java-aware operating system such as Mac OS, Windows, Linux, and Oracle Solaris. It supports Java and C++ and provides impressively speedy code parsing, has a very low memory footprint, and delivers phenomenal remote debugging capabilities. Learn more about Oracle’s support for the new C++ 2011 standard and how you can leverage some of the powerful new features in your existing Java applications. This presentation demonstrates how key features of the IDE—such as code completion, advanced navigation, and code refactoring—help simplify development of mixed-language Java and C++ applications using JNI.\n\n\nAuthors:\nDmitry Zharkov\nDmitry is a Senior Manager responsible for the Oracle Solaris Studio IDE in the Systems Developer Tools group\nView more trainings by Dmitry Zharkov at https://www.parleys.com/author/dmitry-zharkov-1\n\n Ikroop Dhillon\nNo bio available\nView more trainings by  Ikroop Dhillon at https://www.parleys.com/author/ikroop-dhillon\n\n Petr Kudryavtsev\nPetr is a Software Developer in the Systems Developer Tools oganization responsible for several aspects of the Oracle Solaris Studio IDE\nView more trainings by  Petr Kudryavtsev at https://www.parleys.com/author/petr-kudryavtsev\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
