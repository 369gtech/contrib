title: 'Quantum Computing Deep Dive'
language: English
recordingDate: 1620942800
description: "You've probably heard of Quantum Computing, but it still remains a mystery? In this deep-dive session, I will explain important concepts like qubits, superposition, and entanglement. Theoretical knowledge about quantum physics, quantum gates, and quantum algorithms will be associated with practical examples using a real quantum computer on the IBM Q Experience and simulated using Microsoft Q# and Azure Quantum.\n\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nBuild Stuff provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish Build Stuff tech talks.\n\n****\n\nThe World's Top Billionaires: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20kZ6HSiB64&t=0s"
