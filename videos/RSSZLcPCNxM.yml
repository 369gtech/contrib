We pull data from agencies across the government use it and publish charts, articles, and developer APIs.\n\nThis talk will cover the development of Data.gov.sg’s production infrastructure. How we went from a single server to our current deployment environment involving Docker, Git hooks, multiple AWS services and more.\n\nSpeaker Profile\n\nHongyi worked as a product manager at Google from 2011 to 2013. During that time he worked on Spanner with the infrastructure team and the UI redesign of Image Search.
