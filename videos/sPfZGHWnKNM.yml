description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nRDMA Enabled Kubernetes for High Performance Computing - Jacob Anders, CSIRO & Feng Pan, Red Hat  \n\nAdoption of Kubernetes in scientific workloads has been hampered by limited support for high speed interconnects used in HPC clusters. Fortunately, we can now solve this problem by enabling RDMA in Kubernetes.  In this session, we will describe the HPC use case and requirements from an end user's perspective. We will discuss how RDMA, a highly efficient network transport protocol, can be used to address this challenge. We will then provide an overview of a community driven RDMA implementation for Kubernetes using CNI plugins and SR-IOV.  Finally, we will demonstrate real-world applications running in RDMA-enabled Kubernetes environment and provide a performance comparison between standard and RDMA-enabled networking.  You will leave this session understanding the state of the art for HPC networking on Kubernetes. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UacK"
