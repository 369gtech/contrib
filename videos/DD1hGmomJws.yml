description: "Bikeshedding - the act of endlessly iterating over meaningless details - is a natural pastime in software development. We love to design, redesign, and refactor, providing endless variations on a theme. Rarely do these sessions produce any actual business value.\n\nAn alternative is to harness conventions, where we encode patterns in policies, producing smarter code that removes these pointless discussions. In this session, I'll look at how conventions enabled our teams to produce more business value more quickly, not through unsustainable techniques like code generation, but through conventions. With conventions, we can finally blow up the bike shed once and for all.\n\nDevConf 2017 (http://devconf.pl)\n13-15 September 2017"
