description: "Intro: Helm - Michelle Noorali & Matt Fisher, Microsoft \n\nIn this session, we will introduce the basics of the CNCF Helm project. Helm is a Kubernetes package manager and it allows you to install and manages packages of Kubernetes configuration called Charts. Charts provide a way to deploy configurable, out-of-the-box applications and even package your own applications for Kubernetes. We will walk through how to get started with Helm and how to package your own applications as Charts. Helm was first introduced in 2015 and has since grown to meet the needs of its own rich ecosystem. We'll also discuss how Helm has evolved, why, and lessons we've learned along the way. \n\nhttps://sched.co/N4ke"
