description: "From OSCON 2015 in Amsterdam: In the explosion of new open source software “foundations” there’s a crucial element we’re overlooking; the core principle that got everything started and which is the basis for every developers’ success in a modern business. Before we start another Foundation, let’s agree that what we need protected is software freedom and not corporate politics.\n\nAbout Simon Phipps (Wipro):\nCurrently Director of the Open Source Advisory Practice at global technology implementer Wipro Technologies, Simon Phipps has engaged at a strategic level in the world’s leading technology companies, starting in roles such as field engineer, programmer, systems analyst and more recently taking executive leadership roles around open source. He worked with X-series standards in the 80s, on collaborative conferencing software in the 90s, helped introduce both Java and XML at IBM, and was instrumental in open sourcing the whole software portfolio at Sun Microsystems.\n\nAs a director of the Open Source Initiative and of the UK’s Open Rights Group, he takes an active interest in digital rights issues and is a widely read commentator at InfoWorld, Computerworld and his own Webmink blog.\n\nHe holds a BSc in electronic engineering and is a Fellow of the British Computer Society and of the Open Forum Academy.\n\nWatch more from OSCON Amsterdam 2015: https://goo.gl/VeF8tq\nVisit the OSCON website: http://oscon.com\nDon't miss an upload!
