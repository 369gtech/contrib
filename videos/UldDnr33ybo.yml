description: "This presentation was recorded at Voxxed Days Belgrade 2016 - https://belgrade.voxxeddays.com/\n\nAgile is about being agile, and willing to change, not about following any methodology in particular. This talk is about our process, how it evolves, what its current state is and which results did we get so far."
