description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2018\n—\nThe modern C++ community puts a strong emphasis on value semantics. We know how to build types and algorithms thinking in terms of values, their properties and relationships. However, when it gets to the big picture—the architecture—we end up growing ad-hoc webs of mutable objects that perform poorly and are hard to understand, debug and maintain. \n\nIn this talk, we'll learn what value semantics are about in a fundamental way. We'll then use values where they matter most: the architectural foundations of our system! As an example, we'll present the Unidirectional Data Flow Architecture, that is changing how people build interactive software. We'll show some patterns, examples and tools that make it easy to implement, and efficient to execute. \n\nWe will also present Lager, a library that implements such architecture and augments value-based programs with time-travel capabilities!\nLinks:\nhttps://github.com/arximboldi/lager\nhttps://github.com/arximboldi/immer\nhttps://github.com/arximboldi/ewig\n— \nJuan Pedro Bolivar Puente, Independent (Sinusoidal Engineering)\nConsultant\n\nJuanpe is a Berlin based freelance software engineer, with a focus on interactive software, modern C++, functional programming and open source strategy.
