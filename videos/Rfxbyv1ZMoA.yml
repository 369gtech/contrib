title: 'Carat: Collaborative Energy Debugging'

description: "Google Tech Talk\nSeptember 27, 2012\n\nPresented by Adam Oliner.\n\nABSTRACT\n\nWe aim to detect and diagnose code misbehavior that wastes energy, which we call energy bugs. This talk describes a method for performing such diagnosis on mobile devices and an implementation, called Carat, for iOS and Android. Carat takes a collaborative, black-box approach.  A non-invasive client app sends intermittent, coarse-grained measurements to a server, which identifies correlations between higher expected energy use and client properties like the running apps, device model, and operating system. Carat successfully detected all energy bugs in a controlled experiment and, during a deployment to a community of more than a quarter of a million users, detected (and sometimes diagnosed) thousands of instances of buggy apps running in the wild.\n\nAbout the speaker: Adam Oliner\n\nAdam is a postdoc in the EECS Department at UC Berkeley, working in the AMP Lab. Before coming to Berkeley, he earned PhD in computer science from Stanford University, where he was a DOE High Performance Computer Science Fellow and Honorary Stanford Graduate Fellow. Adam received a MEng in EECS from MIT, where he also earned undergraduate degrees in computer science and mathematics. His research focuses on understanding complex systems."
