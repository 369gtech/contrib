title: 'How to build decentralized serverless html5 applications - A. Confetti - Codemotion Amsterdam 2018'
recordingDate: 1530609411
description: 'Do you have an idea for a startup and don''t want to pay for scaling it up? Forget about bandwidth problems, servers to install and pay for, with the power of IPFS, DAT and the blockchain. In this talk, we will explore how to build an HTML5 DAPP (distributed application) with EmbarkJS, and figure out how to rethink servers, storage, messaging, data and payments in a distributed and decentralised way with the help of Ethereum''s smart contracts, IPFS and DAT distributed storage.'
