description: "The NetBeans platform is known for its comprehensive window framework and loosely coupled architecture. JavaFX offers a rich set of visually appealing GUI components. This tutorial shows you how to combine both technologies to enhance the user experience in desktop client applications. It begins with an overview of JavaFX 8 and the NetBeans platform. After migrating a standalone Swing GUI program to the NetBeans platform, youâ€™ll learn how to use JavaFX and FXML to enhance the user experience. The tutorial also shows you how to make JavaFX, Java 8, and Swing work together to create a rich responsive UI while leveraging Scene Builder to enhance the workflow process.\n\n\nAuthors:\nGail Anderson\nGail C.
