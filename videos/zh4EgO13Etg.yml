Really. \n\nOperator overloading is such an unloved part of C++. It's not new, it's not \nglamorous, it's frequently maligned for \"syntax abuse\", and often avoided due to \nperformance or implementation concerns. But operators deserve more \nconsideration! If you're designing types and interfaces, operators have the \npotential to offer concision, clarity, and flexibility, and foster intuition in \na way that functions can't. \n\nIn this talk we'll look at past, current and likely future practices, from the \nhumble old operator+ on arithmetic types to new uses like operator/ to \nconcatenate paths, and beyond. We'll cover concrete guidelines for principled \noperator usage and the implementation concerns involved. \n— \nBen Deane\nBen was in the game industry for 23 years, at companies like EA and Blizzard. He's always looking for useful new techniques in C++, and he | geeks out on algorithms, APIs, types and functional programming.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
