description: "Dan Callahan\nhttp://linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/105/\nI joined Mozilla five years ago to work on [Persona](https://login.persona.org/), a decentralized authentication service designed to replace passwords on the Web. Mozilla [cancelled development](http://identity.mozilla.com/post/78873831485/transitioning-persona-to-community-ownership) three years ago, and plans to [turn off the servers](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/mozilla.dev.identity/mibOQrD6K0c/kt0NdMWbEQAJ) one month before LCA.\r\n\r\nI'd like to talk about what it means to shut down a project like Persona. What did we learn? Where did our plans fail? Is it even possible to design software that gracefully degrades even beyond the point of its own death?"
