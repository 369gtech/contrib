description: "So, all your code is in source control and you have automated the builds and deployment of your software to production but what about the database? Database migrations can be one of the hardest tasks to automate. Rather than automate, a lot of organizations still manually deploy migrations when deploying to production!\n\nIn this talk, Iâ€™ll discuss how in a past role we, as an organization, started to automate our database migrations through development, test, and production in a safe way and give us confidence that our production deployment will work without any unexpected surprises.\n\nI will talk SQL script source control, the management of the migration process from development to production and what tools can help you achieve database migration paradise.\n\nCheck out more of our talks, courses, and conferences in the following links:\nhttps://ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndcdevops.com/"
