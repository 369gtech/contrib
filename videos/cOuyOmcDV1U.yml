description: "Arkadiusz Gil - Software Engineer, CS student and Telemetry contributor\n\nTelemetry ...and metrics for all\n\nTalk in three words: TLS security troubleshooting\n\nAbstract\nIn this talk, we'll look at Telemetry, a new project for metrics and monitoring in the Elixir ecosystem. Telemetry provides libraries for gathering monitoring data from libraries and applications. It's already integrated with Ecto and is coming soon to Phoenix. We'll go through the design and thought process behind it, discuss the rationale for the not-so-obvious decisions, and most importantly, see the bright future of using a unified monitoring solution throughout the community.\n\nObjectives\nThis talk aims to introduce the audience to the Telemetry project and describe the ideas behind it. It will dispel any doubts about it and encourage the whole community to use it in their projects.\n\nAudience\nEngineers who care about monitoring their Elixir systems. However it is really everyone within the Elixir community. One of the goals of this talk is to encourage beginners and experts alike, to start caring about monitoring.\n\nRead the full abstract: http://www.elixirconf.eu/elixirconfeu2019/arkadiusz-gil\n\nThe speaker \nArkadiusz is a student and a software engineer. He has a special interest in distributed systems, monitoring and software design. Recently, he has been working on the  Telemetry project and writing a thesis on improving quality of service in distributed systems.\nGithub: arkgil\nTwitter: @_arkgil\n\nElixirConf EU\nWebsite: www.elixirconf.eu\nTwitter: www.twitter.com/elixirconfeu\nMail: info at elixirconfeu"
