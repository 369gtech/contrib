description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2011\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nDave Thomas - Father of OTI, CEO of Bedarra Corp.\n\nABSTRACT\nIn this talk we describe the huge opportunity for innovation in Legacy systems! We argue there has never been a better time for creative legacy renovations which leverage new hot technologies – languages; data bases; web; cloud and Agile practices. Many talented developers turn up their noses or run away in fear from what they see as baroque environments with arcane tool chains. Talent panic often pushes for a grand rewrite using modern technology. Sadly experience shows the grand rewrite has too much risk and way too little business value. Hence given legacy investments the only option is innovation!\n\nWe illustrate legacy innovations via several case studies spanning a wide spectrum of legacy systems including: mainframe IT; Unix products; military systems; telecom; data banks and multi-vendor EAI and EAP applications. We explain the appropriate practices, teams, and tools to achieve high impact renovations by inserting new technology. We discuss appropriate investments in training, tooling and practices for different legacy environments. We look at approaches to ensuring lasting high value relationships between legacies and bleeding edge technology.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
