description: "Code from Video: http://goo.gl/YIxfI\n\nIn this tutorial, I cover GRASP, or General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns. GRASP defines rules you can use to decide which objects should have which responsibilities in your Object design.\n\nHere I cover the following rules: Creator, Expert, Coupling, Controller and High Cohesion. The tutorial includes a presentation, code examples, sequence diagrams and class diagrams to make everything understandable and interesting. The code used is available in the link above"
