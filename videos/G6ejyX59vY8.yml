title: 'Under the Hood of Reactive Data Access'
language: English
recordingDate: 1538670880
description: "A huge theme in Spring Framework 5.0 and its ecosystem projects is the native reactive support that empowers you to build end-to-end reactive applications. Reactive data access especially requires a reactive infrastructure. But how is this one different from the ones used before? How does it deal with I/O? In this session, we will demystify what happens inside the driver and give you a better understanding of their capabilities. You will learn about the inner mechanics of reactive data access by walking through reactive drivers that are used in Spring Data.\nSeptember 26, 2018\n4:20 pm - 5:30 pm\nNational Harbor 4-5\n\nSpeakers:\nMark Paluch\nSpring Data Engineer, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
