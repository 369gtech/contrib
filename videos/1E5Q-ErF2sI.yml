description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nReal-Time Data Anonymization the Serverless Way - Yuval Lifshitz & Huamin Chen, Red Hat\n\nHow do you ensure privacy protection in the far-flung computing workloads that make up many Edge infrastructures? One way is to ensure that personal information is hidden, on the fly, without introducing lag. Seems like a tall order, but it can be done. This talk presents a Cloud Native Serverless architecture to ensure real time data anonymization, using KEDA and Rook. Specifically, we have extended Ceph to support AWS SQS compatible APIs and developed an external Scaler in KEDA to allow Serverless functions to query, pull, and anonymize objects. This architecture is lightweight, reliable, and scalable. More importantly, the queue trigger mechanism in this architecture does not require us to expose external endpoints to Serverless functions that could become additional attack surfaces. This talk will demo an open source Serverless workflow based on the above technologies. It uses object detection AI models to anonymize images that are produced by Edge workloads."
