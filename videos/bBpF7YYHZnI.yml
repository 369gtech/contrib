recordingDate: 1489428856
description: "Java EE comes with a nice Docker integration and built-in robustness patterns like Bulkheads, Circuit Breakers, Back Pressure and capable telemetry features. The deployments are lightning fast and the deliverables tiny.\nIn this session I will implement a Java EE (Micro and Fullprofile) based “Thin WAR” Microservice based on patterns and common sense. No Slides. Challenging questions are highly welcome.\n\nConsultant and author Adam Bien is an Expert Group member for the Java EE 6 / 7, EJB 3.X, JAX-RS and JPA 2.X JSRs. He has worked with Java technology since JDK 1.0 and with Servlets/EJB 1.0 and is now an architect and developer for Java SE and Java EE projects. He has edited several books about JavaFX, J2EE, and Java EE, and he is the author of Real World Java EE Patterns—Rethinking Best Practices (http://realworldpatterns.com) and Real World Java EE Night Hacks. Adam is also a Java Champion, Top Java Ambassador 2012, and JavaOne 2009, 2011, 2012, 2013 Rock Star. Adam organizes occasionally Java (EE) workshops at Munich’s Airport (http://airhacks.com)."
