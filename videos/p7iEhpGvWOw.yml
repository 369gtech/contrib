title: 'Improving the architecture of your iOS app with GraphQL - Martin Walraven'
recordingDate: 1574948732
description: "GraphQL is a strongly-typed and efficient method for fetching structured data from a server, designed to be an alternative to REST. It was developed in 2012 at Facebook, and has powered Facebook's main iOS and Android apps for the last five years. After being open sourced in 2015, it is now being used by an increasing number of well known companies.\n\nIn this talk, Martijn will introduce GraphQL, discuss why it is such a great match for mobile development, and talk about his efforts to build an open source GraphQL client for iOS, written in Swift."
