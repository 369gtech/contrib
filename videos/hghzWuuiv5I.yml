description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTOpia Chaos Engineering Day 2021. #GOTOcon #GOTOpia\nhttp://gotopia.eu\n\nKelly Shortridge - VP of Product Management & Product Strategy at Capsule8\n\nABSTRACT\nWe all know that production systems must be protected so we can realize value from the software we develop. What is less understood is the right way to keep production systems safe, because trying to prevent any and all badness is more of a prayer than a strategy.\nIn this talk, we'll explore how security failure can manifest in prod systems and how Security Chaos Engineering presents a saner path. We'll cover why it's important to harness failure as a tool and a teacher, along with examples of security chaos experiments you can conduct on [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n02:04 Failure in production\n08:37 Example 1: Log files are deleted or tampered\n09:04 Example 2: Changes to boot files, root cert stores or SSH keys\n09:22 Example 3: Resource limits are disabled\n10:01 Security Chaos Engineering in production\n14:36 Example 1: Create & execute a new file in a container\n15:15 Example 2: Inject program crashes\n15:45 Example 3: Disable resource limits\n16:23 Example 4: Disable access to DNS\n16:58 Example 5: Time travel on host\n17:35 Conclusion\n18:32 Outro\n\nRead the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotopia.us/chaos-day-2021/sessions/1733/winning-at-security-whack-a-mole-with-security-chaos-engineering-security-and-chaos-engineering-a-novel-approach-to-crafting-secure-and-resilient-distributed-systems\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nKelly Shortridge • Security Chaos Engineering • https://www.verica.io/sce-book\nNora Jones & Casey Rosenthal • Chaos Engineering • https://www.verica.io/book\nNora Jones & Casey Rosenthal • Chaos Engineering • https://amzn.to/3hUmuAH\nMikolaj Pawlikowski • Chaos Engineering • https://amzn.to/2SQ5Olf\nRuss Miles • Learning Chaos Engineering • https://amzn.to/3hCiUe8\nMurphy, Beyer, Jones & Petoff • Site Reliability Engineering • https://amzn.to/2Vg6Mbr\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#ChaosEngineering #SRE #Security #SecurityChaosEngineering #Production #FailureInProduction #SCE #SSH #Container #DNS\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
