description: "Abstract: Many organisations are implementing no-deploy Fridays. Nobody wants to be paged on Sunday morning at 3am for a disruptive issue with software you released on Friday. But is simply stopping to deliver software altogether the solution? Is it really fair to your customers to release that same software on Monday? In this session weâ€™ll discuss the strategies, practices and processes you can leverage within your organisation to empower your software development teams to release quality software faster, meet customer requirements and sometimes even embrace failure.\n\nModerator: Angie Leong, Application Services Sales Director, Pivotal\n\nPanelists: \nDavid Varvel, Director of Pivotal Labs Singapore, Pivotal\nTamara Moona, Associate Director, Pivotal Labs Singapore, Pivotal\n\nFilmed at Pivotal Summit 2019 Singapore"
