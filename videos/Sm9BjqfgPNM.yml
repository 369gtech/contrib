title: 'How Community Made Me a #T1DCyborg by Jan Schenk | JSConf EU 2019'
language: English
recordingDate: 1576654725
description: "In his talk on Type 1 Diabetes and the DIY community, Jan describes how he and his daughter went from a standard approved therapy to something called “looping”, which would not have been possible without the immense effort that the community of developers and supporters has put into the Open Artificial Pancreas System (OpenAPS) project for the last 5 years. Looping helped the two of them to increase the quality of their life and avoid otherwise maybe fatal hypoglycemias. He calls to action for everyone to contribute to other communities that complement where medical care systems fails to provide solutions. Every contribution counts, be it still so little.\n\nhttps://2019.jsconf.eu/community-lounge/"
