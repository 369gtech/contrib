description: "\"Reduce hardware costs in Internet of Things using Python\nEuroPython 2020 - Poster session - 2020-07-24 - Poster 2\nOnline\n\nBy Vijay Sajjanar\n\nI guide students in developing systems which are real world and need less hardware. This is possible in 2 steps. One,reduce collecting data which is already available online. Two, compute on cloud instead on the hardware.\n\nCloud computing and Web services have opened a plethora of ways which were science fiction for electronics academia. Python packages such as requests, beautifulsoup and pyserial automate electronics at the grassroot level pushing  all complexities to the cloud.\n\nThis talk is about how I motivate students to use python for tasks which otherwise would require complex setup and costly hardware. I will present case studies of accessing websites (ethically per se!) of Indian Meteorological Department and Indian Railways for Internet of Things. \nReady to return to a classroom session?
