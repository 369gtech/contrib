description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2020 by Kai Koenig.\n\nMore info: https://android-makers-2020.firebaseapp.com/schedule/?sessionId=176505\n\n20-30 years ago the classic path to a software development career was a degree in computer science, mathematics or a closely related field. Our eco-system has changed a lot since then and many developers have joined the industry from all walks of life: self-educated, going through developer bootcamps, cross-training from other professions etc.\r\n\r\nWhile mathematics is not necessarily a requirement to be a good software developer, there are a lot of areas in our day-to-day work that use maths to a varying degree. Think about animations, machine learning, functional programming, lambda calculus and many more.\r\n\r\nThis talk is for people who are interested in extending their maths knowledge, building up on existing foundations or starting from scratch. \r\n\r\nWhile it's obviously impossible to teach maths in 40 minutes, this session will look at common areas in which maths help us being better developers and at the pathways to build up the knowledge needed. You will leave this talk with an idea of what might be useful to know and brush up on and some guidance on how to get there."
