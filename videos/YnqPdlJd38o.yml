title: 'YOW! Lambda Jam 2018 - Amy Wong - Introduction to recursion scheme'
recordingDate: 1533085203
description: "Recursion is used extensively in functional programming. It is indeed iteration through nested data structures. Therefore patterns are identified to generalise the nested structure iteration. Using these patterns can factor out the recursion mechanism from application specific logic for code simplicity. That's the purpose of recursion scheme.\n\nThis talk points out different recursion problems are having similar patterns. The recursion scheme is introduced to support these patterns. It will discuss how the common iteration mechanics is separated from the application specific logic by using the patterns, aka morphisms, provided by the recursion scheme. The fundamental pattern, catamorphism, and a few other commonly-used morphisms will be illustrated with some recursion examples.\n\nThe aim of the talk is to give audience an idea of how recursion can be implemented in simple and elegant ways by applying the various morphisms provided by the recursion schemes.\n\nSoftware engineer worked on concurrent/asynchronous/distributed applications, microservices and big data applications using Scala. \n\nFascinated by functional programming making programmers lazy, spending nights to learn functional programming and explore any design patterns and dependent type when having spare energy.\n\nFor more on YOW!
