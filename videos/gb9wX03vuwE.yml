title: 'Vue PWA to Hybrid with Corber - Alexander Blom'
language: English
recordingDate: 1544211790
description: "This talk will cover taking an existing Vue PWA and wrapping it as a native app – while adding custom mobile-only features (e.g. push). Alex will also touch on PWA performance, and what changes in a hybrid context.\n\nFor many the hybrid/cordova build process is complicated and frustrating – getting a successful build requires dependencies and configs that are not well documented, and never mind cloning to a new machine. He’ll use the corber CLI, which integrates with your existing Ember/Vue/React PWA, adding a unified build pipeline for hybrid, on-device live reload, error checking, improved clone/plugins support and splash/icons. Most importantly, the CLI will not change your existing web only environment.\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc\n\nSave 10% off any FITC event with discount code 'youtube'.\nSee our upcoming events at www.fitc.ca"
