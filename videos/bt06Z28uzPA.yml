description: "How LivePerson is Tailoring its Conversational Platform Using OpenFaaS - Simon Pelczer, LivePerson & Ivana Yovcheva, VMware \n\nThe conversational commerce experience needs to be personalized to allow customers to extend and customize the chat experience with bespoke code.    Attend this talk to hear how LivePerson took one of the most popular open source Serverless projects and built it into their product to add value for customers. Functions allow customers to create custom chatbot behaviour, messaging extensions and commerce workflows. You’ll see a live demo and hear about how the team put together the solution. We’ll cover how we operationalized an open source project so that we can build, ship and maintain our many functions whilst ensuring secure, multi-tenant access.    Ivana will give an overview of the OpenFaaS architecture, CRD and its set of UNIX-like components which build on top of primitives in Kubernetes. She will also share the vision of the open source project and where it’s heading next. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPeR"
