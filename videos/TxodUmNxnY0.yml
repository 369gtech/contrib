description: "RubyConf 2018 - Ruby is the Best Javascript by Kevin Kuchta\n\nSome people love Ruby and some people love Javascript. Both will hate this talk. In a display of complete moral depravity, we'll abuse flexible syntax and metaprogramming to make valid Ruby code that's indistinguishable from Javascript. We'll use a variety of tricks to accomplish it that you can take home and use in more respectable code."
