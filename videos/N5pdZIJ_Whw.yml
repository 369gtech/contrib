description: "\"NLPeasy - a Workflow to Analyse, Enrich, and Explore Textual Data\nEuroPython 2020 - Talk - 2020-07-24 - Parrot Data Science\nOnline\n\nBy Philipp Thomann\n\nEver wanted to try out NLP methods but it felt it too cumbersome to set up a workflow for textual data? How to enrich your data based on textual features and explore the results?\n\nNLPeasy (https://github.com/d-one/NLPeasy) does that: Enrich the data using well-known pre-trained models (Word embeddings, Sentiment Analysics, POS, Dependency Parsing). Then start the Elastic Stack on your Docker. Set-up indices and ingest it in bulk. And finally generate Kibana dashboards to explore the results.\n\nComplicated? Not at all! Just do it in a simple Jupyter Notebook.\n\nIn this presentation we will give an architecture overview of the different components and demonstrate the capabilities of this Python package.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2020.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/\n\n    \""
