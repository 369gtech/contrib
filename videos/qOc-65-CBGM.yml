recordingDate: 1634643159
description: 'Not a new organisational model, but rather a mindset that consider all organisational building blocks holistically. Managing Transformation in todayâ€™s world, requires a lot more than copying an organisation model. It requires rethinking the concepts of Value and Work, and the Sustainability of your enterprise in relationship with an environment that is more and more VUCA.'
