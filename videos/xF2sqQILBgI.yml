description: "I am going to share my experience working with drupal for the last 11 years.\n\nI started developing drupal as a hobby working alone without financial incentive. After 11 years, I have been working in a team of 2-6 of a pan-european company, in team where I collaborate with multiple companies and helping a government body creating in-house drupal team.\n\nIn this session, I am going to share the transition that I had, the change of mindset I had and of course, the challenge I faced as a south-east-asian developer working in Europe.\n\nAfter the session, the audience should know about\n\nHow to face your language barrier.\nHow to cope with social dan cultural differences.\nHow to deal with different organization cultures.\nHow to change a mindset from “I can do everything” to task delegation.\nHow it is “done” is better than “perfect”.\nHopefully we can have a insightful\_discussion in the Q&A session of this presentation."
