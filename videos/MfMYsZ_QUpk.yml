description: "PyData Berlin 2018 \n\nWe're in a transitional time where it is not always clear whether (Deep) Neural Networks are the best way to solve a given problem - even in Computer Vision. This talk discusses practical steps, tools and practices that can help you make that decision and follow through.\n\nSlides: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1SDH8JSK4GW45RdDhUhR2b_mc-AxqeWuL \n---\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
