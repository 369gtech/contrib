description: "JavaScript in the enterprise? Does that even make sense? After years of developing Java applications in the enterprise, many developers have become curious about what JavaScript can do for them. In this session, you will be introduced to some of the issues that arise when writing a large JavaScript application that needs to meet the needs of the enterprise environment. You will also be introduced to the concepts of modularity, responsive JavaScript, mobile development with JavaScript, as well as a range of JavaScript transpilers. By the end of this session, you will have a thorough understanding of whether JavaScript is a sensible solution for you in developing enterprise JavaScript applications, today.\n\nChadwick Chow \nI joined Oracle in 1998 after graduating from University of Waterloo in Canada and has been developing reusable components and data visualizations for the enterprise ever since. Currently I am one of the lead developers on the Oracle JavaScript Extension Toolkit (JET) project."
