recordingDate: 1472052399
description: 'Meetings are broken! They frustrate people, drain energy and can be a massive waste of time. On the other hand, great workshops can transform a team project. They can engage and motivate a team, get quality insights and spark great ideas. Running workshops can seem like a daunting task if you’ve never done it before. This talk will break down the process so you know what do before, during and after your workshop to make it a success. You’ll learn how to plan and prepare so the discussion stays focused, get the best ideas, hear from everyone in the room and lead your team to great work.'
