title: 'Abusing phones to make the Internet of things - Jan Jongboom'
recordingDate: 1438248941
description: "Everyone loves the Raspberry Pi or Arduino, they are amazing little developer boards that drive almost all of the Internet of Things devices.\nUnfortunately they have one small problem... They're very, very expensive. Why do I need to shell out 30$ for a simple dev board, and 69$ for a GSM shield, when I can get a full smartphone for just 25$?! \nIn this talk Jan will literally break apart phones, introduce you to his alternative smartphone OS, hack volume buttons to control LEDs, solder some batteries and even juggle some devices."
