description: "Andy Rivenes (@TheInMemoryGuy) and Maria Colgan (@SQLMaria) continue their series on Database In-Memory features by focusing on In-Memory Aggregation. In this session we review aggregation and what a Group By does, quickly review how a hash join works (see our previous session for more details) and then dive in and explore In-Memory Aggregation or Vector Group By as it is called in the SQL execution plan.\n\nhttps://developer.oracle.com/\nhttps://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/tryit\n\n\nmusic: bensound.com"
