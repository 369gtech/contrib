description: "PyData Chicago Meetup\n \nAbstract:\nWe develop a novel statistical approach to estimate topological information from large, noisy images. Our main motivation is to measure pore microstructure in 3-dimensional X-ray micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) images of ice cores. The pore space in these samples is where gas can move and get trapped within the ice column and is of interest to climate scientists. While the field of topological data analysis offers tools (e.g. lifespan cutoff and PD Thresholding) for estimating topological information in noisy images, direct application of these techniques becomes infeasible as image size and noise levels grow. Our approach uses image subsampling to estimate the number of holes of a prescribed size range in a computationally feasible manner. In applications where holes naturally have a known size range on a smaller scale than the full image, this approach offers a means of estimating Betti numbers, or global counts of holes of various dimensions, via subsampling of the image.\n\nVictoria Belotti is currently a student at the Illinois Institute of Technology. She is expected to graduate in December of 2021 with a Bachelor of Science in Applied Mathematics, Bachelor of Science in Statistics, and a Master of Science in Computational Decision Science and Operations Research. Her academic interests include data science, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.\n\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
