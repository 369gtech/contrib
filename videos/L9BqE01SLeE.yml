title: 'Stand out in search results with Rich Cards'
language: English
recordingDate: 1463599415
description: "Mariya introduces Rich Cards — a new Search result format using schema.org structured markup to display your content in Search results in structured, eye-catchy, easy-to-browse carousels. Implementing Rich Cards is easy: use JSON-LD to add markup to the right pages of your site (more at http://g.co/searchcarousels). Keep track of how your Rich Cards are doing in search results using dedicated reports in Search Console (http://g.co/searchconsole). To debug errors and fix your markup, use the Structured Data Testing Tool (http://g.co/structureddatatest). A new “Rich result” filter in Search Analytics (currently in a closed beta) will help you track rich cards clicks and impressions.\n\nSubscribe to the Google Developers channel at http://goo.gl/mQyv5L"
