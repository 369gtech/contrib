description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nPrescriptively Benchmarking Kubernetes System and Application Using K-Bench - Yong Li, Facebook & Karthik Ganesan, VMware \n\nThis session gives an introduction of K-Bench, a framework designed to benchmark Kubernetes infrastructure from various dimensions in a highly configurable manner. K-Bench accepts a rich set of configuration options and yaml specifications, and parses them into a workload execution plan to provision, manipulate, and coordinate Kubernetes resources. It produces SIG complaint latency and API responsiveness metrics with improved accuracy by adopting a novel timing model. K-Bench also provides a container interface to easily port legacy infrastructure benchmarks into k8s, includes several pre-integrated benchmarks and blueprints to evaluate infrastructure performance at scale like aggregate benchmark throughput across pods, transaction latencies, infrastructure elasticity and resource efficiency in k8s. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ekDd"
