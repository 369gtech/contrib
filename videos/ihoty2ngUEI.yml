title: 'Dev Simple with Converged Database'
language: English
recordingDate: 1633495477
description: 'As enterprises digitize more business processes and decision points, they have multiple development paradigms, data types, and workloads to deal with. Oracle’s converged database is optimized for developer productivity. A converged database is a multi-model, multitenant, multi-workload database. It supports the data model and access method each development team wants, without unneeded functionality getting in the way. It provides both the consolidation and isolation these different teams want but don’t want to think about. And it excels in all the workloads—such as OLTP, analytics, and IoT. #oracledevelopers #database #oci'
