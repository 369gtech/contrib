description: "The Movidius Neural Compute Stick is a miniature deep learning hardware development platform that you can use to prototype, tune, and validate, your AI at the edge. Intel reached out and asked if I would do a video for them, and since I thought the product was cool I said yes. They mailed it to me and I've had a lot of fun using it. In this video, i'll talk about how it works and demo an image classification demo in Python using it. \n\nCode for this video: \nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/Deep_Learning_with_Intel\n\nPlease Subscribe!
