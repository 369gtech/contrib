description: 'Learn about the exciting new features for Azure Kubernetes which bring event driven and serverless to Kubernetes.  Understand AKS Virtual Nodes and how they can unlock serverless containers, and see KEDA in action which brings event driven scaling to any Kubernetes cluster.  Weâ€™ll go through building an Azure Function in Visual Studio Code, publishing it to Kubernetes with KEDA, and watching it scale within Kubernetes the same way the function would scale in the Azure Functions service.'
