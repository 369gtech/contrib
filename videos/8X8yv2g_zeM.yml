description: "How can you make sure that your next Web application supports not only the desktop browser but also all the other devices and screen sizes? And that it can efficiently talk to the back-end services in a bidirectional way? With new concepts for client-side development such as responsive Web design, MVVM frameworks, and hybrid Web applications, and with new APIs for WebSocket, REST services, JSON, and more, the combination of Java EE 7 and HTML5 is a great fit for new Web applications. Attend this session to see how you can efficiently develop such an application and how advanced integrated tools can help you with both server and client code.\n\n\nAuthor:\nPetr Jiřička\nDevelopment manager on the NetBeans team at Oracle. I started developing web applications in Java in 1998, and tools for web application development shortly after that. Since then I have been involved with web development tools for Java EE, HTML5, PHP, Ruby on Rails, Grails and more.\nView more trainings by Petr Jiřička at https://www.parleys.com/author/petr-jiricka-2\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
