title: 'Writing A Visual Novel That Doesn''t Exist - Joshua Jay Herman | PyData Chicago Meetup'
language: English
recordingDate: 1635887454
description: "I am currently writing a video game that uses generative machine learning and procedural techniques to generate art, dialog, and general story progression. The art style and inspiration of this type of game originates from video games known as visual novels which consist of a predefined set of responses, a game tree based on those responses and various two-dimensional art. How this visual novel differs is that the background art consists of pictures that have had the style transferred using AnimeGAN v2, the face which conveys the sentiment of the agent that you interact with is generated by GANStudio, and instead of free-formed text input, a chatbot is created using a combination of Blenderbot (v1) to respond to user input and Distilbert to analyze the sentiment. Based on the sentiment, this determines if you can progress through the game tree. Currently, I am working on integrating the rest of the project with the game tree progression and also making the faces that are shown are better integrated with the background.\n\n===\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.
