recordingDate: 1447193515
description: "Mark Rendell, DevOps Lead, Accenture\n\nIn my experience many large enterprises would love the adoption of DevOps to be as simple as bringing Development closer to Operations. In practice they need to consider many development teams, multiple suppliers, multiple service providers, not to mention multiple business divisions. I will describe my experiences of implementing Continuous Delivery in large enterprises with heterogeneous technology stacks and I will share my belief that Platform Applications will be the savior of enterprise DevOps."
