title: 'DEF CON 29 Aerospace Village - Pearce Barry - Collecting CANs a Bridge Less Travelled'
language: English
recordingDate: 1630569696
description: 'We’ll step back a few years to early 2017, when @zombieCraig released the Metasploit Hardware Bridge as a mechanism to allow Metasploit Framework to reach into networks beyond Ethernet. While the now-defunct HWBridge initially focused on automotive targets, some of that tech, including CAN buses and RF transceivers, has commonality in aviation targets. In this talk, we’ll cover basic design and use of the HWBridge, how one can use it with CAN and RF transceivers, and what it takes to set it up.'
