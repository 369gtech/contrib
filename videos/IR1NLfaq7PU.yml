title: 'Building event-driven (Micro)Services with Apache Kafka by Guido Schmutz'
language: English
recordingDate: 1520853930
description: "This session will begin with a short recap of how we created systems over the past 20 years, up to the current idea of building systems, using a Microservices architecture. What is a Microservices architecture and how does it differ from a Service-Oriented Architecture? Should you use traditional REST APIs to integrate services with each each other in a Microservices Architecture? Or is it better to use a more loosely-coupled protocol? Answers to these and many other questions are provided. The talk will show how a distributed log (event hub) can help to create a central, persistent history of events and what benefits we achieve from doing so. Apache Kafka is a perfect match for building such an asynchronous, loosely-coupled event-driven backbone. Events trigger processing logic, which can be implemented in a more traditional as well as in a stream processing fashion. The talk shows the difference between a request-driven and event-driven communication and answers when to use which. It highlights how a modern stream processing system can be used to hold state both internally as well as in a database and how this state can be used to further increase independence of other services, the primary goal of a Microservices architecture.\n\nGuido Schmutz works for the Oracle Platinum Partner Trivadis. At Trivadis he is responsible for the innovation in the area of SOA, BPM and Application Integration solutions and leads the Trivadis Architecture Board. He has long-time experience as developer, coach, trainer, and architect in the area of building complex Java EE and SOA-based solutions. Currently, he is focusing on the design and implementation of SOA and BPM projects using the Oracle SOA stack. Another area of interest are Big Data and Fast Data solutions, and how to combine these emerging technologies in a modern information and software architecture. Guido is an Oracle ACE director for Fusion Middleware and SOA and a regular speaker at international conferences."
