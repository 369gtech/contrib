description: "People talk about Kubernetes as if it is a single, opaque system and rarely dig in to see what makes it tick. This isnâ€™t the standard talk about why you need Kubernetes or how to deploy into it. Instead, join us to demystify some of the inner workings of a Kubernetes cluster.\n\nLearn what actually deploys containers, what decides where they should go, and understand the component that handles the famous scaling of containers. We will build up a mini cluster one Kubernetes component at a time, explore why we need them, and gain a better sense of what happens to all those YAML files you throw at it.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks, courses, and conferences in the following links:\nhttps://ndcsydney.com/\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
