description: "Storage Provisioning for Kubernetes on Windows - Anusha Ragunathan & Jean Rouge, Docker \n\nAs support for Windows container workloads on Kubernetes heads to GA, we need robust storage interfaces for the many Windows apps that need to manage state. In this session, we will:\n\n1. Start with the foundational constructs around persistent storage in Kubernetes and go over existing mechanisms in-tree that support stateful Windows workloads .\n\n2. Dive into enhancements necessary in existing external storage provisioners to support dynamic volume provisioning for Windows workloads and demonstrate the enhancements through end2end examples with the open source targetd iscsi target as a reference for what is required in plugins for storage backends.\n\n3. Wrap up with what the future of this space looks like in the context of the modern Container Storage Interface, delve into platform changes in Windows necessary to support CSI plugins and short-term workarounds to overcome this. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPfV"
