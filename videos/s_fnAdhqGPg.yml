title: 'YOW! 2016 Todd L. Montgomery - Modern C++: Old Dog, New Tricks'
recordingDate: 1486289391
description: "C++11, C++14, and even C++17 present opportunities for new designs and behaviors. How do these new opportunities actually work out when the project is non-trivial, performance sensitive, and interoperable with other languages? In this session, we will discuss the challenges faced and lessons learned with the use of modern C++ in two recent projects. Aaron is a high performance messaging transport that provides a C++ API that must transparently interoperate with its Java, .NET, and Go APIs. ReactiveSocket is an application protocol providing Reactive Streams semantics over various communication media. Whether you are just curious about modern C++ or are an experienced C/C++ developer, this session will provide some new perspectives.\n\nTodd Montgomery is a networking hacker who has researched, designed, and built numerous protocols, messaging-oriented middleware systems, and real-time data systems, done research for NASA, contributed to the IETF and IEEE, and co-founded two startups. He currently works as an independent consultant on high performance systems and is active in several open source projects, including Agrona, Aeron, ReactiveSocket, and the FIX Simple Binary Encoding (SBE).\n\nFor more on YOW!
