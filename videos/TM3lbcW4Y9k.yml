description: "Firebase and Google Cloud Platform together help developers build extraordinary mobile and web apps. In this session, I'll craft an app live on stage and demonstrate how to create a great user experience using Firebase. I'll then extend this app by calling into Google Cloud Platform APIs, without having to spin up servers or manage infrastructure. You’ll experience firsthand how easy it is to build with Firebase, and how easy it is to scale with Google Cloud.\n\n# Jen Tong\nJen is a Developer Advocate on Cloud at Google. In this role she helps developers build cool stuff on all sorts of platforms. If she’s away from her laptop, she’s probably skating around a roller derby track, or hanging from aerial silk."
