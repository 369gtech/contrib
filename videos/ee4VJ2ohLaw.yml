title: 'Python Web Scraping Tools: A Survey - Singapore Python User Group'
language: English
recordingDate: 1524670081
description: "Speaker: Jon Reiter\r\n\r\nThere are myriad web scraping tools available in Python spanning a broad range of use cases. At the same time there are many surprising gaps in coverage. Further complicating matters, differences which look innocuous in a browser can have an outsized impact on the design of an automated browsing system. In this talk we survey a collection of common web scraping frameworks and work out a mapping from real-world use cases to packages. Along the way we address common questions like:\r\n\r\nHow do I choose among content parsers? What if a page is dominated by JavaScript or HTML5? If I'm going to control a browser which one should I choose? Can I run this in the cloud with no access to a display? Can I download files?\r\n\r\nAbout Jon:\r\nJon worked in finance as a derivative trader for a long time before moving back to technology. He is now heading a start-up which aims to re-cast and modernize the way the financial services industry processes market data.\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/Singapore-Python-User-Group/events/249344900/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/h7ZM/"
