title: 'OSv: The Operating System Designed for Java and the Cloud'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433255206
description: "A lot of the cloud discussion centers around which hypervisors are the best and which management tools will simplify our life the most. But is it the whole story? When problems are addressed from the lower and higher layers, the middleman—the guest operating system—is usually left behind. This changes with OSv, an operating system designed from the ground up to run Java applications in the cloud. OSv is a library OS. Therefore, you can think of using it as being a way to boot a JVM directly into the cloud. Forget OS management: it’s your application and the end of the story. Besides explaining the architecture, this presentation demonstrates how designing an OS with Java in mind can benefit the Java ecosystem.\n\n\nAuthors:\nDon Marti\nDon Marti is a technical marketing manager for Cloudius Systems, the OSv company.
