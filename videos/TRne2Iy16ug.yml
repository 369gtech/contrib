language: English
recordingDate: 1632201716
description: "The shift from industrial thinking to digital product thinking is profound. Tools and structures designed to support one often work directly against the other. Great industrial leadership does not transfer to great digital product leadership. So we tend to think of them as being in conflict.\n\nAgile-in-the-small — a single team with a single product — is all about digital product thinking. Agile-in-the-large is a very different thing. In this talk, Daniel and Anna show how combining industrial and digital thinking is the key to achieving autonomy with alignment, and they offer pragmatic advice and useful tools for achieving agility at scale.\n\nDaniel Terhorst-North uses his deep technical and organisational knowledge to help CIOs, business and software teams to deliver quickly and successfully. He puts people first and finds simple, pragmatic solutions to business and technical problems, often using lean and agile techniques. With over thirty years of experience in IT, Daniel is a frequent speaker at technology and business conferences worldwide.\nThe originator of Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD) and Deliberate Discovery, Daniel has published feature articles in numerous software and business publications, and contributed to The RSpec Book: Behaviour Driven Development with RSpec, Cucumber, and Friends and 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know: Collective Wisdom from the Experts. He occasionally blogs at dannorth.net.\n\nAnna Urbaniak is an Agile and Lean Transformation Coach at Deutsche Bank. For over 10 years she has been managing organisational systems, coaching, and consulting across various industries to help organisations and individuals become better and happier. She enjoys working with people and supporting them in finding their passion and growth. She is passionate about creating organisational systems with principles, processes and believes systems optimised for flow where value can be effectively delivered in a sustainable and measurable manner. Her super powers are lean programme and portfolio management, lean metrics and governance. She gets excited when people get together with courage to experiment with new ideas. She believes there is a lesson in every experience and event we encounter. She values growth, connections and contribution."
