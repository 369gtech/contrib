recordingDate: 1635396082
description: "In this talk, Tim will show how to use modern Headless Browser frameworks like Playwright and Puppeteer and some light coding to drastically reduce the risk of shipping a broken or slow app to production. The talk will give practical examples you can use directly in your Next.js projects and will show why the power of preview deploys and quick, disposable serverless backends, have changed the end-to-end (E2E) testing and monitoring space forever.\n\nTim Nolet\nCofounder and CTO at Checkly\n\nChecklyHQ.com \"free forever\" plan, Visit playwright.dev for a ton more info on Playwright, and checklyHQ.com/learn/headless for extensive set of guides"
