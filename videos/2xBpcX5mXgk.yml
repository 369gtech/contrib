description: "Rich Hickey once said programmers know the benefits of everything and the trade offs of nothingâ€¦ an approach that can lead a project down a path of frustrated developers and unhappy customers. However, as architects, we must consider the trade offs of every new library, language, pattern or approach and quickly make decisions often with incomplete information. How should we think about the inevitable technology choices we have to make on a project? How do we balance competing agendas? How do we keep our team happy and excited without chasing every new thing that someone finds on the interwebs?\n\nSpeaker:\nNate Schutta\nDeveloper Advocate, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
