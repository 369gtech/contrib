title: 'JDK IO 2016 - Andrey Adamovich - Ratpack: core of your micro-services'
recordingDate: 1474443318
description: 'Ratpack reached version 1.0 in 2015. It''s a light-weight framework with a lot of potential. It has a good team and years for coding behind it, but still remains very straight-forward, easy to use, deploy, extend and at the same time it''s very efficient and performing. Its core is non-blocking and implements reactive approaches for handling high-load with little resources. It has all you need for your micro-services.'
