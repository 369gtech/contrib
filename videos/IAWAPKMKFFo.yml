title: 'Molecular Programming with Dr Dominic Scalise'

description: "As I was crawling through various research trying to understand more about the field of molecular computing, I stumbled on several exciting papers by Dr Dominic Scalise. I was curious to learn more, so I invited him to do an interview about his work and his thoughts on the field. Our conversation spans so many different topics in just under an hour, from molecular machine learning to synthetically growing houses. Since the topics can be somewhat confusing to novices (including myself), I went ahead and added explainer assets throughout the video to keep things interesting and retainable. Enjoy! \n\nFind and share 1 biotechnology learning resource you’ve found particularly useful on social media with the hashtag #moleculardharma. Let’s make this a topic anyone can start learning about! \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nINSTAGRAM: https://bit.ly/312pLUb\nFACEBOOK: https://bit.ly/2OqOhx1\nTWITTER: https://bit.ly/2OHYLbB\nWEBSITE: https://bit.ly/2OoVPQF\n\nDominic's work:\nhttps://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HdJtxJkAAAAJ&hl=en\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/dominic-scalise/\n\nHelpful links that he forwarded to me in an email below:\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis video and the following two papers explain the basic mechanisms for how purely DNA circuits operate. I typically have college students start by reading these papers before mentoring them in the wetlab:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cEkIwMYypo\nhttp://www.dna.caltech.edu/Papers/DNA_logic_circuits2006.pdf\nhttp://www.dna.caltech.edu/Papers/seesaw_digital_circuits2011.pdf\n\nThis video shows an animation of the DNA origami technique for building nano structures out of DNA. There is a huge variety of structures that have been built with similar techniques. If you just google image search \"DNA origami\" or \"DNA nanostructures\" you will get a sense of how many different things have been constructed. My general sense is that any 3D structure that fits into a 100x100x100 nM cube can be constructed with nanometer precision using DNA, with some much larger structures also being constructed.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Og7jH3Z68HU\n\nHere is one of several papers on MNIST recognition with DNA circuits (circuits that can learn their own weights are currently under construction):\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0289-6.epdf?author_access_token=nm0eqf6M2igtlNj3RoYEPdRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0MPbd0y2Po7DtnkOd6rR89uPOvbMBRdKaaqwUmU4qAC1cStQ55Teq3NQoSe9UxmCr7Pcbyf52oefvDXtEb1wudUNbQ9-lvxTo5oI7H28ZEsig%3D%3D\n\nHere is a review that discusses how DNA circuits can control DNA nanostructures and other non-DNA materials.\nhttps://schulmanlab.jhu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Control-of-Matter-at-the-Molecular-Scale-with-DNA-Circuits.pdf\n\nHere is a link to VisualDSD (and its user manual), which is probably the most straightforward way for people to explore DNA strand displacement circuits\nhttps://classicdsd.azurewebsites.net/\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2009/02/Visual_DSD_Manual.pdf\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFull Episode Guide:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/Molecular_Dharma_Episode_Schedule\n\nJoin us in the Wizards Slack channel:\nhttp://wizards.herokuapp.com/\n\nLearn Machine Learning in 3 Months:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cr6VqTRO1v0\n\nHit the Join button above to sign up to become a member of my channel for access to exclusive live streams!\n\nCredits:\n- Bryan Johnson Youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMrxnXFTSH0&t=50s \n- All image assets used in this video were pulled from across the Web \n- If I missed a reference, please let me know by emailing me and I'll add it\n\nSignup for my newsletter for exciting updates in the tech world:\nhttps://goo.gl/FZzJ5w\n\nPlease support me on Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/user?u=3191693"
