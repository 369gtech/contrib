description: "Every year publishing executives and industry veterans gather at the O'Reilly Tools Of Change Conference to review the past, ponder the present and envisage the future of publishing. In 2009 the need was to go digital. In 2010 digital publishing went one step ahead, with enhanced eBooks & social networks. The question that now looms is -- 'What will 2011 hold?' We see 2011 as the year 'Global becomes Local'. The internet and the investments that publishing stakeholders around the world are building are creating a new set of opportunities. Today's publishers need to capture the opportunities in this new environment. This keynote will talk about the renewed focus for publishers to create and build strong delivery infrastructure that will serve as the main backbone or pipelines to their new 'Local' market.\n\nSameer Shariff\n\niPublishCentral\n\nSameer Shariff is a serial entrepreneur with a passion for turning ideas into real businesses.\n\nAs the founder and CEO of Impelsys Inc., Sameer drives Impelsys' business vision, strategy, value and growth.
