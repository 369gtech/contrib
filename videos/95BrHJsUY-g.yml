description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2014\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nTim Bray - Father of XML - Uncle of Search Engines\n\nABSTRACT\nSuddenly, in the era of Snowden, privacy and security are at the top of the agenda; anyone who deploys an app without worrying about this stuff is asking for trouble.   This talk quickly surveys the policy issues (including the costs and economics), then focuses on the current state of the art; the technology is moving quickly, but some of the best tools are old ones.  It is becoming possible to offer a high degree of privacy at reasonable cost and effort, without your users needing to know anything about the details of authentication or cryptography.  There are particularly interesting developments in the open-source software domain.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
