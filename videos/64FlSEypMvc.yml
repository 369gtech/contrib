recordingDate: 1517245200
description: "With cybersecurity threats changing rapidly, we definitely need a new set of tools to be able to prevent and address them more efficiently: malware is becoming more complex and harder to detect, malicious insider attacks are on the rise and zero-day exploits make their way to the public much quicker than before. Join this session to see how Windows Server 2016 and Windows 10 can help organizations deal with this ever-changing security ecosystem by providing them with ways to better secure their environment and data. Weâ€™ll touch on topics such as malware & threat resistance, identity & access control, virtualization-based security, configurable code integrity, remote attestation and a few others.\n\nEVENT:\n\nITCamp 2017\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nTudor Damian\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nThe original video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nITCamp web-site: https://2017.itcamp.ro"
