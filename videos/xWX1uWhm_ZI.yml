description: "Do you remember WORA (write once, run anywhere)? Does it still apply to Java? Given the increasing popularity of JavaScript in browsers and other devices, you might conclude that Java is no longer the language in which to achieve WORA. Let’s change that. The situation will improve a bit with JDK8 profiles, but still, will it be enough to make Java popular again for coding for browsers? This session introduces the Bck2Brwsr project, whose goal is to bring Java back to browsers. This includes not only an inventive plug-in-less virtual machine written from scratch but also a set of libraries for smooth HTML5 development. Write models in Java, deploy bytecode to the browser, and use modern JavaScript frameworks such as knockout.js to bind your models to your HTML pages.\n\n\nAuthors:\nAnton Epple\nundefined\nView more trainings by Anton Epple at https://www.parleys.com/author/anton-epple\n\nJaroslav Tulach\nJaroslav Tulach is the founder and initial architect of NetBeans, which is not just a well known IDE, but also the first modular desktop application framework written in Java. \n\nJaroslav will share his API experiences while talking about API Design Checklist - a must have set of rules to follow by every programmer writing code that is consumed by another being.\n\nRegardless how revolutionary NetBeans architecture was at the end of last century, most of it is not slim enough to fit into small devices that rule the world today. NetBeans IDE (as it is) cannot fit into your phone or tablet. Still we want Java that is small enough to run on small devices, phones, plugin-less browsers and more. \n\nThe HTML+Java technology, as designed by Jaroslav fulfills that gap. It is a way to write business ready, yet slim applications once and deploy them everywhere!\nView more trainings by Jaroslav Tulach at https://www.parleys.com/author/jaroslav-tulach-1\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
