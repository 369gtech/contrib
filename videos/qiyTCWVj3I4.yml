recordingDate: 1433784673
description: "This presentation shows you what the speakers and their company have learned about how to create modular Java applications and deploy them in the cloud, using an open source approach without locking in to one of the PaaS providers. The session covers OSGi, scalable Web application architecture, and Apache ACE for deployment and provisioning. Being able to deal with change and dynamics is an important reason for companies to resort to the cloud for application development. Short time to market and rapidly changing requirements can lead to experimental software design, however. Dealing with constant change in a codebase is nontrivial. The same can be said of typical cloud issues such as autoscaling, failover, and incremental deployments.\n\n\nAuthors:\nBert Ertman\nBert is a Fellow at Luminis. He is responsible for stimulating innovation, knowledge sharing, coaching, technology choices and presales activities. Besides his day job he is a Java User Group leader for NLJUG, the Dutch Java User Group (3500+ members). He is a frequent speaker on Java (SE/EE) and Software Architecture related topics as well as an author and member of the editorial advisory board for Dutch software development magazines: Java Magazine and Software Release Magazine. In 2008, Bert was honored by being awarded the coveted title of Java Champion by an international panel of Java leaders and luminaries.\nView more trainings by Bert Ertman at https://www.parleys.com/author/bert-ertman-2\n\nPaul Bakker\nPaul is a software architect for Luminis Technologies. His current focus is on building modular enterprise applications and the cloud. He believes that modularity and the cloud are the two main challenges we have to deal with to bring technology to the next level, and is working on making this possible for mainstream software development. Today he is working on educational software focussed on personalised learning for high school students in the Netherlands. He is also responsible for pushing technology forward. Luminis strongly believes in open source and all the technology development they are doing happens in the open source community. Paul is an active contributor on projects such as Amdatu, Apache ACE, JBoss Forge and BndTools. \n\nHe has a background as trainer on Java related technology and is a regular speaker on conferences such as JavaOne, Devoxx and JFokus.\nView more trainings by Paul Bakker at https://www.parleys.com/author/paul-bakker-4\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
