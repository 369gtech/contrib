title: 'Ooops. I Guess We’re Full-Stack Developers Now with Chris Coyier'
language: English
recordingDate: 1569616207
description: "A few years ago we were front-end developers. These days, as the tools we use to build the web are getting better, easier, and more powerful, we’ve suddenly become full-stack developers. Let’s take a look at what happened and how we can take full advantage of our new super powers.\n\nObjective: Make the case that front-end developers have become a lot more powerful which is both empowering and a burden.\n\nTarget Audience: People who self-identify as front-end developers, or anybody interested in web development.\n\nAssumed Audience Knowledge: Chris won’t be covering what HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are. This will be a bit higher-level than that anyway, but still assume that kind of knowledge. Best if you’ve built a website or two in your career already.\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc\n\nSave 10% off any FITC event with discount code 'youtube'.\nSee our upcoming events at www.fitc.ca"
