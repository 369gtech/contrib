description: "Software quality is about a lot more than slinging good code. As a developer you use numerous tools, techniques, processes and frameworks as you write, organize, build, test, refactor, and continuously improve your applications. SonarQube, a free and open source quality platform, makes it radically easier to track, manage, enhance the overall quality of your code and pay your technical debt on time.\n\nIn this session I’m going to talk about technical debt, the code quality factors, the SonarQube’s core ideas and its star features that simplify the process of tracking and improving software quality."
