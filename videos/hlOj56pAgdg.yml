Many industries, such as retail and publishing, have already been swallowed whole. Television and advertising are half digested, bioscience is in the crosshairs. But like an Ouroboros and software is also constantly eating its own tail; automating itself out of existence. From punch cards, to octal, to assembly language, to static languages, to dynamic languages... software has always been used to make itself irrelevant. Which software subdomains are about to be eaten?\n\nRead the full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/tyler-bettilyon/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - TYLER BETTILYON\nWriter, educator, engineer\n\nTyler is an educator, technologist, writer, programmer, and all around curious human. He holds a bachelor’s degree in computer programming and completed his MBA by counter example in San Francisco’s startup scene. Looking out from inside the Bay Area bubble, he realised that the world is not prepared for the future that technology is bringing. He is now focused on technology education, outreach, and policy.\n\nMore on Tyler Bettilyon: https://codesync.global/speaker/tyler-bettilyon/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM SF 19\nCode BEAM SF is powered by Code Sync.
