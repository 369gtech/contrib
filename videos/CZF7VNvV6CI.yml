description: "Speaker: Naresh Jain (@nashjain), Founder @ ConfEngine.com\n\nOver the past decade, eXtreme Programming practices like Test-Driven Development (TDD) & Behaviour Driven Developer (BDD), Refactoring, Continuous Integration and Automation have fundamentally changed software development processes and inherently how engineers work. While TDD has seen a great adoption on server side, developers still find it hard to apply TDD for developing UI components.\n\nIn code walk-thru where Naresh will build a web commenting and discussion feature (like Disqus) in React.js, 100% test driven. He will also demonstrate how TDD will help us drive an object-functional design to strike a pragmatic balance between the Object-Oriented and Functional Programming paradigms.\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/bbViCfdyQE0wlP?feature=oembed\n\nEvent Page: http://2016.agilesingapore.org\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/XvTE/"
