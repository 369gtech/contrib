description: 'Are you Spring Framework user? Have you ever had troubles with Reactive System? Have you ever gotten rid your whole existed codebase to make the high-throughput system? Have you ever feel the pain during migration? If yes, I have a good news for us, with Spring 5 and Reactor, development of Reactive System is a dream. The new iteration of Spring Framework provides us with end-to-end Reactive System. Moreover, now, you should not care about such things like Callback Hell because Project Reactor gives us a powerful mechanism for declarative, functional, reactive programming styles, which makes the code clear. During this talk, we will take an overview of the migration steps, learn how Reactor helps us during development, and how to achieve end-to-end Reactive System with Spring 5.'
