title: 'Testing Stateful and Concurrent Systems Using test.check - Eric Normand'

description: "Generative testing is great for testing pure functions, but it is also used to test the behavior of stateful systems that change over time. Those systems are often designed for highly concurrent usage, such as queues, databases, and storage. And then sometimes your code is also asynchronous, such as in JavaScript. Learn several patterns to find inconsistencies across platforms, race conditions, and corner cases. This talk assumes basic understanding of generative testing.\nEric Normand is a long time functional programmer excited to see it entering the mainstream. He loves teaching and cooking. You can learn Functional Programming from him at PurelyFunctional.tv and read his thoughts in The PurelyFunctional.tv Newsletter. If you visit him in New Orleans, you can meet his wife and daughter. He’ll even make you some gumbo if you tell him you’re coming."
