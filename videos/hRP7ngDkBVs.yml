language: English
recordingDate: 1492679004
description: "Ehcache 3 offers major API changes. Apart from the JSR-107 compatibility, everything has been updated to make it a library convenient to use while offering advanced configuration options.\n\nAnd one of the major changes is the removal of the Element!\n\nStarting from JSR-107 support in well-known frameworks like Spring, we will show how easy it is to integrate Ehcache 3 in your application.\n\nFrom there, simply through configuration, you will see how to leverage the additional features that Ehcache brings. It will allow us to demonstrate the patterns used in Ehcache 3 to simplify it.\n\nAnd to finish, we will look at the mandatory XML which allows to break all compile time dependency on Ehcache 3 in a JSR-107 context while leveraging the extra features.\n\nLouis Jacomet has been perfecting his knowledge of Java for more than 15 years. Always a developer at heart, his role evolved over the last years to include technical team leading, coaching and some management. In addition to the bits and bytes, Louis is interested in people management skills mandatory to create a productive project team. To complete the buzzword bingo, Louis is interested in agile practices for the visibility, communication and result orientation it promotes. Louis works remotely from Belgium for Terracotta, with a focus on Ehcache."
