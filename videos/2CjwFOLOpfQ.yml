description: "Data is omnipresent in our lives and has the potential to transform how we manage risk for the better.\n\nIn this video, we walk through how we amplify the power of telematics data at HUMN.AI fusing it with hundreds of live real-world contextual variables to create a rich, valuable, up-to-the-second records. This rich dataset is then used to model risk exposure based on Machine Learning algorithms to make insurance fair whilst building a safer world for road users."
