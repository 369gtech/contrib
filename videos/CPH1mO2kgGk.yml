title: 'Applying the principles of chaos to Serverless - Yan Cui - Serverless London 2018'
recordingDate: 1562082182
description: "Chaos engineering is a discipline that focuses on improving system resilience through experiments that expose the inherent chaos and failure modes in our system, in a controlled fashion, before these failure modes manifest themselves like a wildfire in production and impact our users.\n\nCan we apply the same principles of chaos to a serverless architecture built around AWS Lambda functions? Can we adapt and modify existing practices to expose the inherent chaos in our serverless applications? What are the limitations and new challenges that we need to consider?\n\nJoin us in this talk as Yan Cui shares his thought experiments, and actual experiments, in his pursuit to understand how we can apply the principles of chaos to a serverless architecture. A word of warning though, youâ€™re guaranteed to walk away with more questions than answers!\n\nhttps://2018.london.serverlessdays.io/speaker/yan-cui"
