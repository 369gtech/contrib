description: "Just as developers are getting to grips with effective DevSecOps as a means to minimise cyber security vulnerabilities, Zoë Rose covers the next big challenge facing the developer community; privacy.\n\nWhilst overlapping, the concepts of security and privacy are distinctly different. As developers, we should be challenging ourselves to consider not just technical implications of our work, but also the why and how we can remain ethical in our goal to innovate. \nThis talk is going to explore how we balance the exploitation of personal data vs. our shared responsibility to protect our right to privacy.\n\nSpeaker: Zoë Rose"
