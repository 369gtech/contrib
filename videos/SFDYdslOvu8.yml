description: 'Spring Cloud is here! It offers a powerful way to create and consume microservices. As you introduce new services, you introduce integration problems: services can be shaky, they can disappear and - as they''re often exposed over HTTP - they require a bit more footwork than in-process method invocations. In this webinar, we''ll focus specifically on how Spring Cloud integrates service registration (e.g. Eureka), declarative REST clients (with Netflix''s Feign), reactive programming and the circuit breaker pattern with Hystrix to support easy, robust service-to-service invocations, and messaging microservices with Spring Cloud Stream. This is a deep dive on how to make connect and consume microservices, and is a natural next step after the introduction to building microservices with Spring Boot.'
