description: "Serverless computing is sweeping the cloud industry and transforming how we're building applications on the cloud. Node.js has been the first language each of the major serverless providers has supported from day 1. Node.js applications written for serverless are changing from their \"server\"ed past. We'll discuss why serverless went Node.js first, what impact this will have on Node.js developers, and finally, what consequences this might have on Node.js's ecosystem.\n\nTalk given by Chris Anderson at Node Summit 2017.\n\nThanks to Node Summit for giving us permission to post this talk. freeCodeCamp is not associated with this talk. We're just excited to bring more exposure to to it!\n\n--\n\nLearn to code for free and get a developer job: https://www.freecodecamp.com\n\nRead hundreds of articles on programming: https://medium.freecodecamp.com\n\nAnd subscribe for new videos on technology every day: https://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=freecodecamp"
