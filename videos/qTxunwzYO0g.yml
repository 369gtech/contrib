description: "Autoscaling Multi-Cluster Observability with Thanos and Linkerd - Andrew Seigner, Buoyant & Frederic Branczyk, Red Hat \n\nUniform observability across polyglot applications can be challenging, even more so across multiple clusters. In this talk, Andrew Seigner from the Linkerd team and Frederic Branczyk from the Prometheus team will demonstrate adding observability to applications across multiple Kubernetes clusters with zero code changes, and then autoscaling Thanos to enable observability across all clusters in one unified view. They'll outline how Linkerd uses Prometheus to provide zero-config observability for applications running in Kubernetes, and how Thanos enables observability to scale across any number of Prometheus instances. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPbU"
