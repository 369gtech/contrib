description: "Exploring Application Portability Across Public Cloud Providers Using K8s - Erin Boyd & Ivan Font, Red Hat \n\nApplication portability across hybrid clouds is a cornerstone of application deployment strategies. Kubernetes offers a vital abstraction across cloud providers’ infrastructure for using multiple clusters, but up until now there has not been a native Kubernetes experience for managing your clusters. With the advent of Kubernetes multi-cluster features such as Cluster Registry and Federation-v2, we now have a registry to store all your cluster endpoints with a control plane to support managing and migrating your applications across your hybrid cloud infrastructure. But what about your data? There’s a solution for that too in the shape of federated and stretch volumes. Come learn how Kubernetes multi-cluster features combined with federated & stretch volumes are used to migrate a simple reference application across public cloud providers. \n\nTo Learn More: https://sched.co/GrWH"
