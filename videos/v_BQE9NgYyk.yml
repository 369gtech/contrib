title: 'Hima Tammineedi - Screen Recording, but with HTML not Pixels | May 2021'
language: Spanish
recordingDate: 1621465966
description: 'I asked myself - would it be possible to make screen recordings on my computer without the results being a large video file? Perhaps it wouldn''t be possible for everything, but perhaps it could work for just websites. This talk will be about how a friend and I built a way to create screen recordings of websites that look like videos, but which are really moving websites. We call it Capsule https://capsule.click/. With a Capsule screen recording, you can actually use your mouse inside the recordings! The recording now actually feels just like you''re on the original website instead of it feeling like you''re watching a video. In this talk, I want to talk about how this is possible, and why it''s great.'
