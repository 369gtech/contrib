The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nWhen Distributed Database Meets Cloud - Lessons Learned - Yanqing Weng, Pivotal\n\nDatabase as a Service is one of the most interesting and challenging domains in the cloud industry. We’re migrating distributed databases like Greenplum (traditional MPP database) and Apache HAWQ (Hadoop native SQL engine) to make it a reality.  This talk will be about the lessons we’ve learned - the best practices and pitfalls we’ve discovered during our journey which includes:  - How to containerized distributed database and what help could Kubernetes provide?   - How to redesign legacy architecture of distributed database to be cloud native?  - How to make smart scheduler for optimal resource utilization?   - How to distribute stateful workloads and improve performance by data locality?  - How to leverage Operator pattern to automate distributed database operation?  - How to integrate CNCF projects with distributed database to make it easy to use? \n\nTo learn more click here: https://sched.co/FuJW"
