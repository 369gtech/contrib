title: 'Murali Kashaboina - Erlang In Action: Creating Scalable Edge Based Iot Solution - Code BEAM SF 2018'
language: English
recordingDate: 1521318092
description: "Entrigna’s data scientists had an idea to create an IoT software platform that could process large amounts of data and scale while living on the edge. They evaluated several different technologies, however, Erlang was the best fit for their needs. In this presentation, we will speak about Entrigna’s needs, how we evaluated the different languages, why we chose Erlang and then demo how an Erlang solution can run and scale through a cluster of Raspberry Pis.\n\nMore details here: https://codesync.global/speaker/murali-kashaboina/"
