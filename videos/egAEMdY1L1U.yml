title: 'Webinar: The evolution of cloud orchestration systems from ephemeral to persistent storage'
language: English
recordingDate: 1602112913
description: "Public clouds, OpenStack, and Kubernetes all started by supporting only non-persistent “cattle” VMs and containers. Over time the cloud orchestration systems evolved to adding persistent storage support. In this talk, we’ll evaluate how different orchestration systems made the same choices and took a very similar path to evolving their storage features and why persistent storage matters.\n\nPresenter:\n\nBoyan Krosnov, CPO @StorPool"
