description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Chicago 2020. #GOTOcon #GOTOchgo\nhttp://gotochgo.com\n\nGarrett Smith - Founder at Guild AI and Chicago ML\n\nABSTRACT\nIn this session, you learn engineering techniques for building machine learning systems. Machine learning methods are capable of delivering immense business value. But machine learning is still not leveraged in many organizations. Engineering challenges and lack of software and systems experience are leading causes. The solution is to apply engineering practices to machine learning systems development end-to-end.\nGarrett Smith presents keys to successful ML systems development. These include methods for working with data scientists, common tool sets, and automation. You learn the importance of short, iterative release cycles for data science. You learn how to show business value early in a project. With this information, you're better [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n01:21 What is machine learning?\n02:04 AI adoption in the enterprise 2020\n05:30 The fundamental problem in most organizations\n06:07 Data science vs. traditional software\n08:58 ML systems development\n14:14 Unify data science & engineering teams\n15:43 Use software best practices\n16:57 Identify model success criteria metrics\n19:20 Solve a simple problem first\n20:10 Automate end-to-end on day 1\n22:22 Ongoing refactoring with tests\n25:05 Keys to building ML systems (summary)\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotochgo.com/2020/sessions/1414/keys-to-building-machine-learning-systems\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#MachineLearning #ML #DevOps #DataScience #AI #ArtificialIntelligence #Programming\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
