recordingDate: 1566264600
description: "The Three-Rs of Data-Science - Repeatability, Reproducibility, and Replicability\n\nAdaptation of data-science in industry has been phenomenal in the last 5 years. Primary focus of these adaptations has been about combining the three dimensions of machine-learning i.e. the ‘data’, the ‘model architecture’ and the ‘parameters’ to predict an outcome. Slight change in any of these dimensions has potential to skew the predicted outcomes. So how do we build trust with our models? And how do we manage the variances across multiple models trained on varied set of data, model-architectures and parameters? Why the three Rs i.e. “Repeatability, Reproducibility, and Replicability” may have a relevance in industry application of data-science?\n\nThis talk has following goals:\n\nJustify (with demonstrations) as to why “Repeatability, Reproducibility, and Replicability” is important in data-science even if the application is beyond experimental research and is geared towards industry applications.\nDiscuss in detail the requirements around ensuring “Repeatability, Reproducibility, and Replicability” in data-science.\nDiscuss ways to observe repeatability, reproducibility, and replicability with provenance and automated model management.\nPresent various approaches and available tooling pertaining to provenance and model managements and compare and contrast them.\n\nA software professional with experience in product design, development & leading teams. Enjoys architecting and developing the next generation highly scalable, fast failing distributed platforms that encompass latest engineering techniques and machine learning models to bring a positive difference to overall end-user experience.\n\nFor more on YOW!
