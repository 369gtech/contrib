title: 'Maps Live: Animated Ground Overlays and Weather with Google Maps SDK for iOS'
language: English
recordingDate: 1390215072
description: "Mano Marks and Steve Gray demonstrate an iOS app that displays weather patterns on top of a map using the Google Maps SDK for iOS (http://goo.gl/8n3lV). Steve has used both ground overlays (http://goo.gl/JnRZOk) and tile overlays (http://goo.gl/QgMiYK) in this app. Animated ground overlays display the weather patterns overlaid on the map. And Steve uses a tile overlay to tone down the map styling and remove the map labels, giving a nice clean background for the weather data. Steve's app is an open source project, available on GitHub: https://github.com/sjg/Synoptic.\n\nMore info in his blog post:\nhttp://www.stevenjamesgray.com/blog/2014/01/18/animating-ground-overlays-in-google-maps-ios-sdk/"
