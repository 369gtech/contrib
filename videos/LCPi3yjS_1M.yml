language: English
recordingDate: 1592236812
description: "Deep Dives are interactive technical live and on-demand events for developers, architects, or anyone building IoT solutions. Check out the Azure RTOS samples featured in Deep Dive here: https://aka.ms/azrtos-github Microsoft engineers and guest speakers do technical deep dives about a new feature or scenario. List of all upcoming Microsoft IoT Deep Dives: https://aka.ms/iotshow/deepdive\n\nAzure RTOS is a small, fast, reliable, and easy-to-use real-time operating system. In this video introduction, we’ll discuss the major components that make up the Azure RTOS ecosystem: the ThreadX RTOS, NetX TCP/IP stack, FileX embedded file system, GUIX embedded GUI, and USBX embedded USB stack. We’ll also cover some tools to make development easier, such as GUIX Studio (a WYSIWYG GUI designer that auto-generates C code to run on embedded devices) and TraceX (an event trace tool that feels like a software logic analyzer).  \n\nGuest Speaker: Scott Larson - Azure IoT Senior Engineer\nDeep Dive Host: Pamela Cortez - Azure IoT"
