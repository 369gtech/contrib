description: "Join us for LIVE CHAT on LearnTV: https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/tv/\n\n10:00 AM: Keynote by Brendan Burns, CVP, Microsoft, and co-creator of Kubernetes\nThe latest updates on how we are helping enterprise customers build reliable, scalable applications with open source and cloud native technologies.\n\n10:30 AM: AKS - Recent announcements and roadmap\nSean Mckenna, Principal Lead Program Manager – Kubernetes Service\nAKS continues to grow rapidly in usage and capabilities. This session was highlight some of the announcements across developer productivity, security, operational efficiency, and more and tee up some of the major investments on our near-term roadmap.\n\n11:00 AM: Azure Arc - Recent announcements, Arc enabled servers and Kubernetes, GitOps with Arc and AKS\nJason Hansen, – Principal Program Manager, Azure Arc / Chris Sanders – Senior Program Manager, Azure Arc\nAzure Arc enabled Kubernetes and Server continue to make updates. Learn about recent releases and upcoming preview features. We will also dive deep into some new GitOps scenarios that include expanded authentication as well as covering both Azure Arc enabled Kubernetes and AKS.\n\n11:30 AM: AKS on Azure Stack HCI\nAbhilasha Agarwala, Program Manager, Azure Edge and Platform\nAzure Kubernetes Service on Azure Stack HCI is an on-premises implementation of the popular Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) orchestrator, which automates running containerized applications at scale. Azure Kubernetes Service is now in preview on Azure Stack HCI, making it quicker to get started hosting Linux and Windows containers in your datacenter.\n\n12:00 PM: First Look: OSM integration with AKS\nPhillip Gibson – Senior Program Manager\nOpen Service Mesh is a lightweight and extensible cloud native service mesh that takes a simple approach for users to uniformly manage, secure, and get out-of-the box observability features for highly dynamic microservices environments. The Azure AKS and Network teams have been hard at work to integrate OSM with the managed AKS service. Here is an early first look at how some of the upcoming integration and experience will look like.\n\n12:30 PM: Identity management in distributed applications using Dapr\nMark Chmarny, Principal Program Manager\nDapr makes microservice development easier in any language. Using its consistent APIs and reusable building blocks, developers can quickly build distributed applications that are both dynamic and portable. To secure these applications, Dapr provides automatic in-transit encryption using mutual TLS, SPIFFE-based application identity, and a granular set of easy to configure runtime access control policies. This session will review these options with a live demo of:\n\nTrust relationship definition between microservices\nOperation-level access policy\nComponent and secrets access scoping"
