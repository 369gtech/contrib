description: "Crammed with practical tips for making a Scrum team work well together over a distance of 5,000 miles, this lightning talk draws on a ScrumMaster’s real, recent experiences of working with a dev team in India and DevOps support in Sri Lanka. I divulge what has really worked for my team, what really didn’t, and the things I still want to try.\n\nCovering practical issues from running good retros remotely and estimating stories with ease, to integrating new team members and providing effective servant leadership at a distance, this talk aims to inspire those who dread the prospect of trying to make Agile development work with an offshore team.\n\nAbout Malie Lalor\nMalie has been working as a ScrumMaster since mid-2015. Her love of Agile dates back from the years she worked as part of the product team that piloted Scrum for relaunching OxfordDictionaries.com at OUP. Malie’s interest in helping offshore teams gel stems from her work at Pearson, where her team members are located in India, Sri Lanka, and the UK. She uses Scrum and Kanban to help the team deliver software that accelerates students’ learning and makes schoolteachers’ lives easier. A Certified ScrumMaster, she is constantly inspired and daunted by how much there is still to learn about Scrum."
