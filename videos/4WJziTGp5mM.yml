But it is a very nice special-purpose programming language. In this talk, I would like to introduce Prologâ€™s programming model, showcase some programming domains in which Prolog allows for very concise, elegant programs, and finally describe how it can also be used as a general-purpose tool.\n\nRead the full abstract: http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2019/lars-hupel\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - LARS HUPEL\nINNOQ\n\nLars is a consultant in Munich, Germany.
