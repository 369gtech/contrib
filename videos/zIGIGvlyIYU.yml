recordingDate: 1600177256
description: 'Dell EMC Enterprise Storage and Data Protection solutions come with all the required Kubenernetes integrations for workload deployment, data management and protection as well as migration across the hybrid cloud. In this three-part demo we will cover some key enterprise capabilities of the Dell EMC storage and data protection solutions for Kubernetes workloads. The first part covers how CSI snapshots can be used to repurpose production data for test and dev environments. The second part shows the deployment of a YugaByte database based application deployment using VVOLs on PowerStore with VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid. Finally, in the third part, we show complete application protection of a MYSQL workload with application consistency and use the backup copy to spin the entire app on a new Kubernetes cluster all on AWS.'
