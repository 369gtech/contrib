recordingDate: 1352911415
description: "Ask and vote for questions at http://goo.gl/qh5OV\n\nJoin us on Wednesday November 14th for our Monthly Mobile Web Hangout! This month Brad Frost will be joining us to talk about responsive design versus separate mobile sites.  Although the US presidential race is already decided, the candidates spent a lot of time intensely debating the country's hot-button issues. The web design world is entrenched in our own debate about how to address the mobile web: should we create a separate mobile site or create a responsive experience instead?\n\nIt just so happens that the two US presidential candidates have picked different mobile web strategies for their official websites. In the red corner is Republican candidate Mitt Romney's dedicated mobile site, while in the blue corner is incumbent president Barack Obama's responsive website. Sit back, crack open a cold one, and watch the battle unfold as Brad dissect the candidates' sites to uncover best practices and common mobile web pitfalls."
