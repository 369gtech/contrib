recordingDate: 1552899760
description: "Deep Learning is fast becoming an indispensable approach to getting the most from your data. In this session attendees will learn both how Deep Learning fits into the Artificial Intelligence landscape as well as how to get started using PyTorch. The session will start with the basic intuitions behind the problem setup, models, and optimization methods used to solve computer vision problems.\nAttendees should come away with a strong foundation of how to both create deep learning models as well as how to consume them in their applications. Prior exposure to PyTorch is definitely not expected.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
