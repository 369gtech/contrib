description: "By building a simplified chaos monkey service, we will walk through how to create a good foundation for an asyncio-based service, including graceful shutdowns, proper exception handling, and testing asynchronous code. Weâ€™ll get into the hairier topics as well, covering topics like working with synchronous code, debugging and profiling, and working with threaded code.\n\nEVENT:\n\nEuroPython 2019\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nLynn Root\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nATTRIBUTION CREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6vC_LOHBJ4"
