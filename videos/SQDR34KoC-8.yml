description: "Microservices, rapid scalability & high density deployment platforms like Kubernetes require apps with low memory usage and fast boot time.\n\nJava had been the outsider due to its focus on throughput at the expense of CPU & RAM. No more. Enter Quarkus, a microservices Java stack bringing your favorite libs (Hibernate, vert.x, Camel, RESTEasy ...) to GraalVM and HotSpot with low memory usage and fast boot time.\n\nEnough to swim in containers like fish in water. Data is usually the hardest part, lets demonstrate Quarkus with persistence and Hibernate ORM.\n\nCome explore live reload, opinionated persistence with Hibernate Panache, testing, GraalVM native compilation and more.\n\nSince Quarkus is better lived than talked, expect a heavy demo session.\n\nEmmanuel is Java Champion, Distinguished Engineer and Chief Architect Data at Red Hat (middleware).\nHis work is Open Source.\nHe is most well known for his contributions and lead of the Hibernate projects\nas well as his contribution to Java standards.\n\nHis most recent endeavour is [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io) (A Kubernetes Native Java stack tailored for GraalVM & OpenJDK HotSpot, crafted from the best of breed Java libraries and standards).\n\nHe speaks regularly at various conferences and JUGs, including\nJavaOne, Red Hat Summit and Devoxx.\nHe hosts several podcasts including [Les Cast Codeurs](https://lescastcodeurs.com).\n\nYou can follow him on twitter at\n[@emmanuelbernard](http://twitter.com/emmanuelbernard).\n\n #quarkus #debezium #infinispan #hibernate-orm #hibernate-search #hibernate-validator #hibernate-ogm #ceylon #JPA #bean-validation #lescastcodeurs"
