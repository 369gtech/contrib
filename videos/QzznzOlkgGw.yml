description: "In this series we demystify React testing for beginners. We show you how to test React components using Jest & React Testing Library. No prior testing experience necessary.\n\n### Video Links\n\nBuy React Testing For Beginners: https://www.leveluptutorials.com/store/products/tutorials/lut-dd026\n\nBecome a Pro: https://www.leveluptutorials.com/pro\n\n### Affiliate Links\n\nPlease use these links when signing up for services to help support Level Up.\n\nEasy Hosting with Netlify: https://goo.gl/pychVP\n\nShared Web Hosting: https://goo.gl/pfC6uc\n\n\n### Level Up Links\n\nSyntax Podcast ft Scott Tolinski & Wes Bos: https://goo.gl/7jDDxX\n\nSubscribe to the Level Up Newsletter\nhttp://eepurl.com/AWjGz\n\n\nDeveloper Ready\n\nComplete and ready to set-up JavaScript testing solution.

One of Jest's philosophies is to provide an integrated \"zero-configuration\" experience. We observed that when engineers are provided with ready-to-use tools, they end up writing more tests, which in turn results in more stable and healthy code bases."
