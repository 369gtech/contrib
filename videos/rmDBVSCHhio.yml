The speakers introduce their topic and provide a preview of one or more topics that will be covered in their talks.\r\n\r\nO3D allows you to create rich 3D web applications using JavaScript. This talk will primarily cover best practices for getting 2D and 3D content into O3D. We will also explore the API's advanced features, primarily through demos and coding examples to keep the session fun."
