description: "RailsConf 2019 -  From test && commit || revert to LIMBO by Shane Becker\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nCloud 66 - Pain Free Rails Deployments\nCloud 66 for Rails acts like your in-house DevOps team to build, deploy and maintain your Rails applications on any cloud or server.\n\nGet $100 Cloud 66 Free Credits with the code: RailsConf-19\n($100 Cloud 66 Free Credits, for the new user only, valid till 31st December 2019)\n\nLink to the website: https://cloud66.com/rails?utm_source=-&utm_medium=-&utm_campaign=RailsConf19\nLink to sign up: https://app.cloud66.com/users/sign_in?utm_source=-&utm_medium=-&utm_campaign=RailsConf19\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nKent Beck (TDD, eXtreme Programming, Agile Manifesto) has a couple new ideas. They both sound so terrible and impossible that they just might be totally amazing.\n\n1. test && commit || revert If tests pass, commit everything. If they fail, revert everything. Automatically. Wild.\n\n2. LIMBO. Anything that's committed is pushed. Anything that's committed by teammates is automatically pulled in while you work. So wild.\n\nDoes this work? Does it scale? Will I always be losing important progress because of a typo? Will this make me a better / faster / happier programmer?\n\nWe'll cover tools, process, deficiencies, mental models, and experiences. Show up and see what happens."
