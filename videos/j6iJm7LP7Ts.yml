description: "Full title - Pawel Cyrta: Sound Modelling - parametric methods and deep learning representations to create and shape audio\n\nSound in digital form for years is in the loop of steps: record, mix, edit, playback and listen. Some creative ones did create synthetic speech and music with affordable tools. Now both computation and data resources available made synthesis and sound shaping possible using parametric, physical methods or with the latest deep learning representation models. Discover the theory and code to do it.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
