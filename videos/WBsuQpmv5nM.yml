description: "Autonomous robots have the potential to change the world as we know it, freeing up humans from mundane tasks (or as we like to term them, \"jobs\").  \n\nBut how do we know that the robots will do what we want them to do, and how can we ensure that they will not misbehave in unexpected ways?\n\nThis talk will explore some new ideas around understanding the plans that are used to control robotics systems, using the power of functional programming and high-level functional abstractions to ensure that the actions that a robot carries out do what was originally intended, even in the presence of unexpected situations or unpredictable events.\n\nNo actual robots will be hurt in the course of the talk.\n\nMore details: https://codesync.global/speaker/kevin-hammond/"
