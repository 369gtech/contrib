title: 'VICTOR RENTEA - Functional Programming Patterns with Java8'
language: English
recordingDate: 1544126022
description: "Java 8 is cool... But do you know to write elegant code with it? Have strong coffee and come to this insane live-coding session to see some real-life functional programming patterns extracted from production code.\n\nAfter leading 2 projects making heavy use of Lambdas and Streams, counseling many others at IBM, and teaching hundreds\_of developers at University and as an Independent Trainer, Victor will prove several best practices, patterns and anti-patterns he distilled over the years. All via a series of live coding exercises, like you've probably never saw in your life! You will hear about: Bloated Lambdas, A Happy Predicate, Stream Wrecks, How to Kill The Biggest Bug, Monads, Passing-a-block and The Loan Pattern, and 5 Ways to Implement Type-Specific Logic. Of course, as a Clean Code Maniac, Victor will always strive for maintainable, readable, elegant code. So you'll see a lot of refactoring.\n\nPS: You know, some Joe will maintain your Java8 code at some point. So let's just hope Joe would be a nice safe guy..."
