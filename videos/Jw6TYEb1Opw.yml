language: English
recordingDate: 1491895789
description: "There is trouble brewing in the land of microservices – today’s shiny technology is tomorrow’s legacy, and there is concern that we will all be dealing with spaghetti services in 2018…\n\nIt is often a sign of an architectural approach’s maturity that, in addition to the emergence of well-established principles and practices, anti-patterns also begin to be identified and classified. In this talk we introduce the 2016 edition of the seven deadly sins that if left unchecked could easily ruin your next microservices project…\n\nThis talk will take a tour of some of the nastiest anti-patterns in microservices, giving you the tools to not only avoid but also slay these demons before they tie up your project in their own special brand of hell.\n\nTopics covered include: Pride - selfishly ignoring the new requirements for testing; Envy - introducing inappropriate intimacy within services by creating a shared domain model; Wrath - failing to deal with the inevitable bad things that occur within a distributed system; Sloth - composing services in a lazy fashion, which ultimately leads to the creation of a “Distributed Monolith”; and Lust - embracing the latest, greatest (and costly) technology.\n\nDaniel Bryant is leading change within organisations and technology with OpenCredo. His current work includes enabling agility within organisations by introducing better requirement gathering and planning techniques, focusing on the relevance of architecture within agile development, and facilitating continuous integration/delivery. Daniel’s current technical expertise focuses on ‘DevOps’ tooling, cloud/container platforms and microservice implementations. He is also a leader within the London Java Community (LJC), contributes to several open source projects, writes for well-known technical websites such as InfoQ, DZone and Voxxed, and regularly presents at international conferences such as QCon, JavaOne and Devoxx."
