description: "As all aspects of our lives become more distributed and the world gets ever smaller - we can “Zoom” anywhere in milliseconds! - systems that support tasks large and small become more interconnected as well. Distributed systems are the future, and anyone who says otherwise is probably selling monoliths.\n\nWith the number of applications and cloud regions expanding at a dizzying rate, communication is key. In this session, the presenter leads attendees on a live-coding adventure exploring various options for your critical interservice comms. Topics covered depend on time available, but may include:\n\nHTTP-based interactions, e.g. REST APIs using standard types\nHTTP-based interactions using Reactive Streams publishers\nServer Sent Events\nWebSocket\nRSocket\nMessage-based interactions using messaging platforms, e.g. RabbitMQ, Kafka\nAll examples will be coded live & in real-time. Hailing frequencies open, Captain!\n\n====\n\nMark Heckler is a software developer and Spring developer advocate at VMware, conference speaker, published author, and Java Champion focusing upon developing innovative production-ready software at velocity for the cloud.
