title: 'The Secrets of the Build Scan Plugin and the internals of Gradle by Nelson Osacky, Soundcloud EN'
recordingDate: 1592403197
description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2020 by Nelson Osacky, Soundcloud.\n\nMore info: https://android-makers-2020.firebaseapp.com/schedule/?sessionId=172401\n\nBuild scans provide some very useful information about Gradle Builds. Build time, configuration time, task execution time.\nScans even show garbage collection time, time spent downloading dependencies, time spent in annotation processors? What can you do with all this data?\n\nIn this talk I'll share how to surface actionable information from your Gradle build immediately to developers without using the build scan plugin or Gradle Enterprise."
