description: 'This talk is about covering language aspects and idioms that you usually donâ€™t see in a 101 talk. Among other things we''ll understand covariance and contravariance with generics, learn about the secrets of inline functions in Kotlin and how combining them with reified generics we can work around type erasure on the JVM. We''ll dive into lazy evaluation with sequences, use delegation to leverage code reuse and understand lambdas with receivers better to create our own DSL''s. Finally, we''ll dive into co-routines and see how this powerful concept allows us to deal with concurrency and asynchronous programming, and its difference to languages such as C# or Java.'
