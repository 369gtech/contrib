She's always been fascinated by how things were made, and started coding since 16. After working as a software developer for a few years, she decided she wanted better tools for building software, and founded UI-licious to create such tools. UI-licious is a tool for software teams to rapidly and reliably automate UI testing for their web applications.\r\n\r\nSurbhi is the CEO and co-founder of FireVisor. Before starting an AI company, she has built automation systems for semiconductor and memory giants that saved them 80% cost and thousands of unproductive work hours. She aims to make manufacturing great again and that is what FireVisor does. With its proprietary artificial intelligence powered software platform that understands manufacturing data, FireVisor prevents product failure and defects for high volume manufacturing companies.\r\n\r\nDeepti is CTO and co-founder at Adaface. She is a self-taught programmer who has previously researched ML algorithms for earthquake early warning systems at Caltech, started up and failed, waited tables at Pizza Hut and built a WhatsApp bot for blue collar recruitment (used by Uber, Dominos, Flipkart etc). Adaface helps companies automate first round tech interviews with a conversational AI, Ada. Ada can analyse each candidate's thought process, give timely hints and ask follow-up questions to accurately gauge on-the-job skills.\r\n\r\nThis event is open to everyone who is there to inspire women to excel in tech careers.\r\n\r\nAll members are required to abide by the Women Who Code Code of Conduct - https://www.womenwhocode.com/blog/code-of-conduct\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-Singapore/events/256003219/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\r\nRecorded by: Purnima Kamath\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/mSxg/"
