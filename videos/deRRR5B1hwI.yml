title: 'DEF CON 29 - Cory Doctorow - Privacy Without Monopoly'
language: English
recordingDate: 1628185141
description: "Governments around the world (US, UK, EU) are planning to force interoperability on the biggest tech platforms. Companies like Facebook say that this is a privacy disaster because it would hurt their ability to keep us safe from privacy invasions. Yeah, I know. But even if you DO think Facebook has our best interests at heart, monopoly is a deeply stupid way protect privacy. I will present \"Privacy Without Monopoly,\" a major EFF white paper I co-authored with Bennett Cyphers, which sets out a framework for understanding how privacy and interop aren't just compatible - they rely on one another!\n\nhttps://www.eff.org/wp/interoperability-and-privacy"
