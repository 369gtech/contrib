language: English
recordingDate: 1513387745
description: "Let’s live code a game together using just CSS and HTML! This talk will demonstrate the power of CSS and will teach a few fun tips as tricks as we build a simple game. It’ll be based in Sass — using data structures like matrices and HTML counter-incrementing, and a little bit of web magic to tie it all together. This talk will inspire you to play with and create your own CSS games, pushing the boundaries of what’s expected from the language itself.\n\nEVENT: CSSConf 2017\n\nSPEAKER: Una Kravets\n\nPERMISSIONS: Event organizer and the speaker provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nORIGINAL SOURCE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmVH85G59Lk&t=1637s"
