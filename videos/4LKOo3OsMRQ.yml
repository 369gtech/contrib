title: 'The UX Conference 2017: Card Sorting (Zhivko Dimitrov)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1524775775
description: "Interactive workshop on card sorting â€“ why you should use it, when is it helpful, how do you carry it out.\n\nHow do you structure your navigation? How do you group fields in a form? How do you label your categories? If you are solving these problems on your own without your users, you can only find out if you solved them well after expensive usability testing.\n\nCard sorting, instead, incorporates direct user feedback in the early stages of Information Architecture, saving potentially costly mistakes further down the road. We will merge real life examples and tips for a hands on workshop to help you experiment with card sorting in your own designs.\n\nThis talk is part of The UX Conference organised by The School of UX in London on June 13th 2017.
