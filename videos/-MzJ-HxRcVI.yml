description: "How to Build a Slack-Controlled, Saxophone-Playing Robot (on Wheels) Using Elixir and Nerves\n\nSlides and more info: http://www.elixirconf.eu/elixirconf2016/paul-wilson\n\nStarting with a brief explanation for why Elixir is an excellent choice for embedded systems, we will look at how to building a cool Elixir robot, using [Nerves](http://nerves-project.org). ​ You will learn how to: ​ * get started (often the hardest part) * structure an embedded OTP appplication * customise an embedded linux using Buildroot/Nerves * control your robot using an embedded web server * control your robot with [Slack](https://slack.com) ​ You will leave this presentation with more than just inspiration; you will have an actionable plan to make something fun with embedded Elixir. You will also have a genuine stepping stone towards creating a robust and secure _Internet of Things_ product.\n\nTalk objectives\n\nThe audience should leave with a clear understanding of how to get started with embedded Elixir. It will be a practical, rather than purely inspirational talk.\n\nTarget audience\n\nThose with some Elixir knowledge, but no experience of using Nerves to embed Elixir.\n\n\nPaul is a coder with 20 years experience (only a couple with Elixir, though). Paul has spoken at various conferences and events including RubyConf, The Naked Agilist, and guest lectures at Glasgow Caledonian and Edinburgh Napier Universities. Paul is now CEO of Cultivate Software. He was also part of the team that won the giant banana presented to Jim Freeze at Elixir Conf 2015.\n\nGithub: paulanthonywilson\n\nTwitter: @paulanthonywils"
