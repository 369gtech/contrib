description: "Multithreaded Java applications commonly exchange information and coordinate operations by using the Java collections framework and Java concurrency utilities. Achieving application reliability, scalability, and performance with these libraries requires an understanding of the fundamentals of Java concurrency. This introductory/refresher session reveals the fundamentals of threading, synchronization, atomic operations, locks versus CAS, contention, false sharing, deadlocks, fairness, and other topics while looking at their impacts on collections performance. The session is intended for developers and students who may be new to Java and/or concurrency and wish to begin using collections concurrently within their applications.\n\n\nAuthors:\nChris Hegarty\nChris Hegarty is an engineer in Oracle's JDK team, currently focused on core libraries and networking.\nView more trainings by Chris Hegarty at https://www.parleys.com/author/chris-hegarty-4\n\nMichael Duigou\nMike Duigou is a developer on the Oracle Java Core Libraries team.
