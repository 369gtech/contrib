description: "Using Google Data APIs and OAuth to Create an OpenSocial Gadget\r\n- Eric Bidelman & Monsur Hossain\r\n\r\nThanks to the new OAuth Proxy, developers can write JavaScript gadgets for OpenSocial containers that can securely access Google Data APIs. But did you ever wonder what goes on behind the scenes? This session will present a walkthrough of an OpenSocial gadget and will explain the components and their interactions that make such secure access possible.\r\n\r\nFor those who are attending I/O, we thought it might be useful to hear from some of the speakers in advance. These videos provide a preview of one or more topics that will be covered in their talks."
