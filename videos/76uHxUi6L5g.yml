description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2018\n—\nC++11 came up 7 years ago, yet not all projects have made the upgrade today. \nBut that shouldn't stop you from adopting Modern C++, which idioms are quite older than C++11. \nUsing those patterns will not only ease the pain of working with an older revision of the standard, it will also help you migrate to a more recent compiler. \n\nJoin me in this talk for a quick tour of what the Modern C++ philosophy is, how you can apply it to your C++03 codebase while preparing for the future. \nFollowing my experience of working most of the 2010s decade with a large C++03 codebase, I will explain how to emulate C++11 (and later) features and also provide a couple tips and mistakes to avoid when moving to a more recent standard, including how to convince your boss to sponsor it.\n— \nMathieu Ropert\nExperienced Programmer, Paradox Development Studio\nFrench C++ expert working on (somewhat) historical video games. Decided to upgrade his compiler once and has been blogging about build systems ever since. Past speaker at CppCon, Meeting C++ and ACCU. Used to run the Paris C++ User Group. Currently lives in Sweden.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
