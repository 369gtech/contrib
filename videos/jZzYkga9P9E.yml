description: "This video was recorded at Scala Days Copenhagen 2017\nFollow us on Twitter @ScalaDays or visit our website for more information http://scaladays.org \n\nAbstract: \nThe new Scala compiler is nearing beta readiness. A lot of thought has gone into designing Dotty to be as fast and structurally sound as possible. Now comes the next step - adding a new level of usability to the compiler and the surrounding tools.\nIn this talk I want to show what Dotty can offer you as a developer in terms of improved experience - whether it is awesome error messages, rewrite rules or optimizations.\nI will also talk about how we are optimizing the project for outside contributors, and what you can do to get involved today!"
