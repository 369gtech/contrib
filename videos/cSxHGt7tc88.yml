description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\ngRPC Proxyless Service Mesh with Security - Sanjay M Pujare, Google\n\ngRPC has been a popular choice for building microservices based service mesh architectures especially after the recent introduction of service mesh features such as service discovery, load balancing, and observability which eliminated the need for sidecar proxies - like Envoy - in the service mesh. The introduction of these features in gRPC enabled a \"proxyless service mesh\". In this session we will talk about the addition of mTLS based transport security to the proxyless service mesh. We will describe the orchestration of security by the xDS control plane, the addition of a security plugin architecture to gRPC, and the implementation of some of those plugins to take advantage of security infrastructure in the Google Kubernetes Environment (GKE)."
