Come for a deep dive of new Visual Studio Code features which provide a rich, productive environment for C++ development across platforms. Features such as remote development with containers, the Windows Subsystem for Linux, and SSH, configuration improvements, build/debug features, IntelliSense enhancements, and using vcpkg to integrate 3rd party libraries will be presented live so you can see how they can aid in your day-to-day editing, building, and debugging. We will also share our open-source approach to developing the C/C++ extension.\n— \nTara Raj\nMicrosoft\nProgram Manager\nTara is a Program Manager at Microsoft working on C++ for Visual Studio Code and vcpkg.
