language: English
recordingDate: 1417535304
description: "Don’t tell your boss, but I want you to make a useless art project–because it’s actually pretty useful. Why? Committing to uselessness is a freeing experiment. As professionals, we tend to focus on the end result instead of the process, and that’s not healthy. Embrace the creative process (iteration and experimentation) on a project and see where the path takes you.\n\n“Inspiration is for amateurs. The rest of us just show up and get to work” - Chuck Close\n\nTranscript & slides: http://2014.jsconf.eu/speakers/brad-bouse-usefulness-of-uselessness.html\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
