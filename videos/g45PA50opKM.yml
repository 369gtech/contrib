description: "Speaker : Ingrid Epure\n\nGetting code into production can have consequences beyond just making your customers happy. It can wake people up in the middle of the night, bring down the datastores, be a cost nightmare, and remind you ‘imposter syndrome’ is a real thing. More importantly, it can break trust , create frustrations, and burn people out.\n\nSo what happens when a full-stack engineer joins an operational team and goes to war with operational risks? Are there more skills to be gained besides cool war stories and scars after each incident?\n\nIn this talk we will explore the benefits of spending time on a team with a completely different profile than your prior experience. And how front-end, back-end and operational teams have more in common than you might think We’ll go through what an operational readiness checklist is, and why it’s important, and how to gain more visibility into the impact of the chance you’ve just deployed."
