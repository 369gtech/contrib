description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io\_The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nA Journey of Building an Enterprise AI PaaS With Kubernetes - Vincent Xie, Bestpay \n\nProductionizing ML model has a long data lineage and modeling is just a small part of it. Previously, Bestpay relied on Spark (on Yarn) for heavy data processing, while the training and serving workloads were running on separate clusters with various tools (PyTorch, TensorFlow, MxNet and etc.). It has high operational complexity and inevitably caused a high data redundancy, low work efficiency and resource utilization for the company.   By embracing the PaaS concepts, they build a CloudNative ML infrastructure with Kubernetes, providing an end-to-end ML service in a more efficient and manageable way.     This talk will highlight:  - co-locate Big data, deep learning and micro-service workloads with Kubernetes  - unify model serving layer for different ML library flavors   -a case of online model service breakdown to share how can we properly configure Istio in production \n\nhttps://sched.co/cp8r"
