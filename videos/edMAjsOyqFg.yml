title: 'Resource Management on Java Systems Running the OSGi Framework'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433784747
description: "Java is a popular choice on many small/medium-size embedded platforms. In many fields, running multiple applications in parallel is key. The OSGi framework is used to enable a multiple-application environment on a single JVM. Typically these devices are resource-constrained. Running multiple Java applications simultaneously can lead to a resource shortage. This session discusses resource management on OSGi-enabled platforms and addresses how a resource manager works with the JVM to ensure zero resource crunch. The focus is not only on resource shortage avoidance but also on how it can help developers diagnose and solve application issues. The session describes how developers can use it to profile their applications on resources beyond CPU and memory.\n\n\nAuthors:\nSvetozar Dimov\nSvetozar Dimov is a Senior Software Architect and Department Manager at ProSyst Labs Bulgaria.
