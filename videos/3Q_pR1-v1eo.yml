title: 'Robert Carbone - wxErlang & Faithful Representation - Code BEAM SF 2018'
language: English
recordingDate: 1521269303
description: "For over a decade, Erlang's cross-platform GUI interface, wxErlang, has sat dormant without a meaningful & practical guide. This talk is wxErlang's long-awaited tutorial.\n\nAs one of the first presentations on the subject, we have an opportunity to discuss\nbest-practices surrounding the understandability & comparability of the code we shall ultimately write for each other.\n\nTo do so, we draw on knowledge from the accounting profession, in particular Conceptual Statement 8 (CON 8).\n\nCON 8 is the central framework in the worldwide 'Harmonization' effort: principles set forth by the FASB¹ & IASB² to guide the internationalization of accounting standards.\n\nWhether you find this surprising or not, Accountants and Erlangers both deal with very similar issues; such as what, where, and when to log information, and in our case of WxErlang, how to ultimately present data to the user.\n\nFrom there we shall promptly delve into the gears of wxErlang.\n\nBy the end of this talk, not only will you be able to craft a basic wxErlang application, but also be well equipped to participate in writing code that can help harmonize the community.\n\nFASB¹  Financial Accounting Standards Board\nIASB²  International Accounting Standards Board\n\nMore details here: https://codesync.global/speaker/robert-carbone/"
