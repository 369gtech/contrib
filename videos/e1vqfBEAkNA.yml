title: 'Jordan Adler, Joe Gordon - Migrating Pinterest from Python2 to Python3 - PyCon 2019'
recordingDate: 1557110999
description: "\"Speakers: Jordan Adler, Joe Gordon\n\nOver the course of nearly a year, we migrated Pinterest's primary systems from Python2 to Python3.  A large, tightly coupled codebase with over 2 million lines of code, the Pinterest codebase contained nearly every edge case that might exist in a Py2 to Py3 migration.\n\nWe'll cover our approach, gotchas, and tools, and the incredible impact our migration has made on infra spend and code quality.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2019 and https://github.com/PyCon/2019-slides\""
