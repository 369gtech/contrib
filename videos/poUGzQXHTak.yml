title: '"Open AND High Performance Computing" - Hugh Blemings (LCA 2020)'

description: "Hugh Blemings\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/60/\n\nOpen hardware for embedded and general purpose applications with low to medium compute performance requirements has become almost commonplace, a response to a growing understanding of the need for solutions that embrace libré principles.\r\n\r\nOpen hardware for server class/high performance computing requirements is a relatively new concept but is, appropriately, becoming an area of focus for data centres, supercomputers, and security conscious workstation/end users alike. Contributors to the OpenPOWER project have been working together to create an open ecosystem based around the POWER Instruction Set Architecture that enables truly open -and- high performance compute solutions. \r\n\r\nThe resultant systems extend from high performance embedded systems, desktop workstations up to the worlds fastest supercomputers and have an entirely open software stack - firmware to remote management to hypervisor to OS to applications.  Many of the systems have hardware that is likewise entirely open source at the schematic, PCB and, increasingly component level.\r\n\r\nPut colloquially: OpenPOWER systems are the only commodity high performance systems out there that don’t have any funny hidden management engines, or binary blobs of executable code in their firmware.  Some even ship with a recovery DVD that in addition to the full source code for everything running on the machine, include the schematics and other technical drawings too.\r\n\r\nThis session will explain the importance of open hardware and software at all levels of the compute environment - embedded/IoT to desktop to hyperscale systems. From here a brief introduction to OpenPOWER and the OpenPOWER Foundation as well as an update on the ecosystem, the status of the hardware and software stacks in question as well as an overview of some of the OpenPOWER hardware out there.  There will be at least one system of great interest to LCA attendees that will have it's Oceania debut at this talk.\r\n\r\nThis will be a technical/community/ecosystem talk, not a “sales pitch” :)\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
