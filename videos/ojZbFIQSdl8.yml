description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2016\n—\nC++ has a pretty good type system, and modern C++ gives us a greater ability than ever before to use that type system for good: to make APIs easier to use and harder to misuse, to make our datatypes more closely express our intent, and generally to make code safer, more obvious in function and perhaps even faster.\n\nThis is an interactive session - incorporating games played between presenter and audience, even - taking a look at choices available to us as datatype and API designers, and examining how a little knowledge about the algebra of algebraic datatypes can help. We'll see why std::optional and (hopefully soon) std::variant will quickly become an essential part of everyone's toolbox, and also explore how types can be used to express not just the structure of data, but also the behaviour of objects and functions.\n— \nBen Deane\nPrincipal Software Engineer, Blizzard Entertainment\nBen has been writing games for almost 20 years, and in C++ for most of that. He is currently a Principal Engineer at Blizzard Entertainment where he works on the Battle.net team. He's always looking for useful new techniques in C++, and he likes functional programming.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
