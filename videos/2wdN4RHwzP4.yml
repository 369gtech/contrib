description: "The Things Git Can Do (that none of the GUIs have ever told you about)\n\nIn this session, I'll demonstrate what Git can do for you that none of the GUI tools ever tells you about. Moving chunks of commits between branches, custom history visualizations and undoing operations are only some of the things I'll show you how to doâ€”all 100% from the command line!"
