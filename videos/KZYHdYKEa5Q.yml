description: "With the new model Azure Resource Manger Microsoft are gaining the repeatability they always wanted for deployment to the Cloud and removing the dreary, repetitive, error prone manual deployment tasks which has always held us back!\nWith ARM you can create a Template for your environment and use that for deploying identical environments every time without fail! There is some news in the world of “infrastructure as code” that we need to take into account while setting up our Cloud environments. The Win we get from being able to deploy our development environment or our temporary load test environment automatically and identically to our production environment cannot be understated. This is ARM from a project efficiency, development and also DevOps perspective. This is what you need to know in order to make you much more efficient every day of development."
