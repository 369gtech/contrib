If you have fear, uncertainty, or doubt about exception safety or just want to see the best practices for using exceptions in C++ and/or C++11/14, this session is for you. We'll start with \"What is the problem we are trying to solve?\" and discuss alternatives, acknowledge the challenges associated with exception usage, and cover some well-meaning but misguided attempts at safety. I will then present a set of guidelines that are the basis for safe exception usage and solid implementation techniques, including how to transition from an exception-unsafe legacy code base.\n\nWhen we are finished you will know how to produce code that is easier to write, easier to understand, faster, and 100% robust in the face of exceptions.\n--\nJon has been programming in C++ for over twenty years. During the last two decades he has written C++ for Apple, Dow Chemical, Intuit, Lotus, Microsoft, Netscape, Sun, Yahoo! and some less well­?known companies. He taught C++ in the graduate school at Golden Gate University for three years and is a founding moderator of the Boost?User and Boost?Interest mailing lists.\n\nJon is active in the Silicon Valley chapter of the ACCU and programs the C++ track at the Silicon Valley Code Camp.\n\nJon blogs at http://slashshlash.info@_JonKalbJonKalb on G+LinkedIn\n--\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
