title: 'Architecting your codebase - Kamil Szyma≈Ñski @ Spring I/O 2016'

description: "Spring I/O 2016 - 19 -20 May Barcelona\n\nNowadays, it's easy to hear that every big system will inevitably become a big ball of mud and that microservices are the only cure for that disease.\nWe're often convinced by that and blinded by buzzwords we re-implement our systems in new, \"better\" ways making the same mistakes again and again.\nIn this talk we won't bother with fairy tales nor silver bullets instead we'll focus on the root cause of codebase rot, the cause that lies in the source code, not in the lack of some brand-new architecture, all-problems-solving technology or other magic incantations.\nWe'll take one of the Spring's demo projects and refactor it. We'll discuss existing flaws and question the way things were done.\nAre you a fan of clean code? See what it means to apply similar thinking at the architectural level."
