language: English
recordingDate: 1575589831
description: 'ARINC is a 90-year-old company originally created to coordinate and support radio communications for airlines. Since then, ARINC has developed several standards to promote interoperability between manufacturers of line-replaceable units (LRUs.) This talk will cover major ARINC standards, such as ACARS (an air-to-ground messaging system), 429 (the CAN bus of aviation), and AFDX, and explain why itâ€™s completely impossible to control a 737 through a compromised in-flight entertainment system.'
