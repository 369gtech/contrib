description: "Robert Ancell\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/151/\n\nFor the last year I have run a Code Club (https://codeclub.nz/) at my local primary school. In this talk I will cover:\r\n- Why starting a club is challenging, fun and rewarding.\r\n- How the Code Club organization makes it easy to get going quickly.\r\n- Finding the right software and hardware to be able to run the club.\r\n- The good and bad aspects of starting with Scratch (https://scratch.mit.edu/).\r\n- How to migrate children to using Python.\r\n- The new material I developed for the children based on observations of how they learned and what motivated them.\r\n- The appropriate use of hardware (Raspberry Pi and BBC micro:bit)\r\n- Challenges in attracting more volunteers to the club.\r\n- Keeping a good gender balance.\r\n- Fundraising.\r\n- Unexpected requirements that led me to develop some new software.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
