And most importantly: what can we learn from Toy Story? \n\nDan Gärdenfors is a friendly guy who runs a design studio called Nobiz. He enjoys making vision videos for innovative products. He coaches a lot of startups and teaches teams how to maximize user experiences while minimizing waste. \n___________________________\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry.
