title: 'Why You Should Consider Haskell for Your Next Production System (Christian Charukiewicz)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1637077029
description: "Haskell is a top choice for building production software systems. While Haskell does have a large surface area, with many concepts and syntax that will feel unfamiliar to programmers coming from other languages, it is unrivaled in its combination of developer productivity, code maintainability, software reliability, and performance.\n\nIn this talk I will cover some of the defining features of Haskell that make it an excellent, industrial-strength language that is well-suited for building commercial software. You'll learn why we consider it our first choice for new projects, and why you should too.\n\nThis talk was recorded on 15 November 2021 at the Haskell eXchange virtual conference."
