description: "Slides and more info: http://www.erlang-factory.com/euc2016/annette-bieniusa\n\nYou need a data store that allows for high throughput, scalability and availability, while supporting adaptable consistency?\n\nAntidote is a highly-scalable distributed key-value store that features conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs), atomic multi-key writes, snapshot reads, and data partitioning. It offers different types of consistency, ranging from strong consistency, to causal consistency and eventual consistency. Antidote is written in Erlang and has been developed as part of the EU research project \"SyncFree\".\n\nIn my talk, I will give an introduction to CRDTs, Antidote's transaction concept, and its replication protocols. I will present Antidote's performance with several benchmarks and use cases.\n\nTalk objectives:\n\nYou will see how your application will benefit from cutting-edge research on consistency and replication.\n\nTarget audience:\n\nPeople who are looking for a highly-scalable key-value store to boost the availability and scalability of their application."
