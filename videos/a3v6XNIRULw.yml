description: "In this panel, weâ€™ll discuss various sides of the debate on the most effective ways to be a candidate or to hire technical candidates. We probably all know that we need more than a resume and a whiteboard to get a great match between job and candidate, but what exactly should that process really look like? What signals are most important to select for? Join us as we dig through to try and find some clarity.\n\nNotes:\nhttps://github.com/fitcevents/webu-2016/blob/master/Increasing%20Effectiveness%20As%20A%20Technical%20Candidate_Interviewer.md\n\nFITC produces events for digital creators in Toronto, Amsterdam, NYC and beyond\nSave 10% off any of our events with discount code 'youtube'\n\nCheck out our events at http://fitc.ca\nor follow us at https://twitter.com/fitc"
