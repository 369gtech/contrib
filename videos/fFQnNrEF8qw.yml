description: "Pure Functions and Immutable Objects - the best of OO and FP worlds\nVictor Rentea, Independent\n\nAbstract This presentation focuses on two of the most advanced design tools in your toolbox, whatever the language or framework you might be using. After understanding the basics, we'll see how these concepts can be used in real-world scenarios to simplify those several most complex use-cases in your application. At the end of a mix of slides and live-coding, you'll finally understand the power of these ideas and become prepared to apply them in your day-to-day work.\n\nAlong the way, we'll talk about Side Effects, Idempotency, Referential Transparency, Pure Functions, Deep/Shallow Immutability and weâ€™ll explore the Functional Core - Imperative Shell segregation to apply to your most complex workflows.\n\nPrepare for an entertaining, highly interactive session that will answer all your questions.\n\nWritten in Java and spoken in English.\n\nRecorded Tuesday 11 May 2021 kl. 12:00"
