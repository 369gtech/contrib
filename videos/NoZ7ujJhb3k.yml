description: "This is a comprehensive dive into the current emergency phones with an in-depth look at the phones used in elevators. This talk will provide unique insight into a topic that hasn't been covered before: Elevator Phones. During this talk, I will discuss the commonality between elevator phone brands. I will cover a new, never before released, set of default passwords these system use. I will show a tool kit and how to use it to access elevator phones locally, as well as remotely. In addition, I will show how to reprogram a phone , how to make the elevator state its location, and how to alert the passenger that help is on the way. Finally, I will demonstrate some attacks, including how you can use elevator phones as listening devices to silently listen to conversations of people inside an elevator. Iâ€™m WillC, your elevator operator, let's go for a ride!\n\nWillC\nWill has grown up with a passion for making things.
