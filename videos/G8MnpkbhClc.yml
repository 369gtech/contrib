description: "Building your own PostgreSQL-as-a-Service on Kubernetes. - Alexander Kukushkin, Zalando SE \n\nHow many DBAs does it take to manage 500+ PostgreSQL HA clusters? Very close to zero, if you run them on Kubernetes with the help of postgres-operator.  This talk is a story, how the team of Database Engineers at Zalando developed open-source components like Patroni and postgres-operator to run company-wide PostgreSQL-as-a-Service on Kubernetes. I will share how we automate all routine operations, providing developers with easy-to-use tools to create, manage and monitor their database, avoiding commercial solutions lock-in and saving costs. I will describe the benefits and pitfalls of running production databases on Kubernetes and, finally, show open-source tools we have built for application developers to deploy and manage PostgreSQL clusters by writing short manifests describing a few essential properties of the result. \n\nTo Learn More: https://sched.co/GrU0"
