description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nDeclarative and Imperative Kubernetes Operations with Temporal and M3 - Matt Schallert, Chronosphere & Dominik Tornow, Temporal\n\nOperators allow users to orchestrate complex software, such as databases, running on Kubernetes. However, due to their declarative nature, expressing and coordinating imperative actions (such as “create a backup”) is awkward and cumbersome. In this talk, Matt and Dominik will explore how declarative solutions, such as Operators, along with imperative solutions, such as Temporal, an OSS Workflow Orchestration Platform, can be used to automate the operations of complex software systems on Kubernetes. They will demonstrate how Temporal workflows can leverage the same Go libraries users are familiar with. Finally, using the OSS M3DB Operator as an example, they will demonstrate how Operators and Workflows work in tandem and mitigate each others' limitations. You will walk away with an accurate, actionable, and dependable understanding of Kubernetes Operators and Temporal Workflows and how to craft scalable and reliable operation automation for your Kubernetes applications and clusters."
