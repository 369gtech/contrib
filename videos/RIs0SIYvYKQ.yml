description: "Google Internet Summit 2009: The State of the Internet\r\nMay 6, 2009\r\n\r\nGoogle Internet Summit 2009 Search and Cloud Computing Session.  The speakers are Udi Manber, head of Search Quality at Google, and Bill Coughran, Vice president of Engineering at Google.\r\n\r\nOn May 5 and 6, 2009, in Mountain View, we brought together Googlers and leaders from academia and the corporate world for a 2-day summit to discuss the state of the global Internet. The goal of the summit was to collect a wide range of knowledge to inform Google's future plans--from product development and market reach to users' expectations and our ability to keep the Internet open yet secure.\r\n\r\nMore than 30 speakers and moderators led discussions around 8 topics: Networks; Wireless and Sensor Technologies; Security; Standards; Applications; Democracy, Law, Policy and Regulation; Search and Cloud Computing; and The Future. Eric Schmidt, who offered some remarks, expressed optimism that the challenges we face with governments' walling off access to the Internet can be overcome technologically by building networks that are transparent, scalable, and open."
