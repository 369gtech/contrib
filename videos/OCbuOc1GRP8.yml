description: "This video was recorded at Scala Days Berlin 2016\nfollow us on Twitter @ScalaDays or visit our website for more information http://scaladays.org \n\nAbstract:\nI will present the ongoing effort to port and cross-compile (most of) Akka, one of the biggest frameworks in the Scala land, against the alternative compiler of Scala.js.\nWe dig into various use cases from taming UI complexity to server side concurrent code made easy on Node.Js server side and more over!\nProperly handling distributed and concurrent runtimes with the very same abstraction layer will turn your world upside-down breaking the frontiers between client and server development."
