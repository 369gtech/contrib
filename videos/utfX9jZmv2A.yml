description: "Video from Devoxx Poland 2019.\n\nIn the Java world, Spring is a great beast, a Dragon, and with a good reason. Spring is a very powerful framework which does a lot for developers while giving them a lot of power. All this power, of course, doesn't come without its price.\n\nMost of the developers using Spring are either happy to pay this price or not aware of it at all. On the other hand, Micronaut comes with the promise of all the power of Spring, while not having any of the costs that Spring brings to the table.\n\nLet us look at it, how it compare and differ to Spring and if it lives up to its promises."
