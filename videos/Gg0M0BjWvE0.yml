description: "So much of the adult population currently utilizes subscription services like Netflix, but there are hidden implications to usersâ€™ privacy inherent in the subscription process that cannot be aided by privacy policies. Users must be aware of the threat they present to themselves. This talk will be focused on the interesting vulnerabilities presented by privacy oversights of users between subscription services and the services used to pay for them. \n\nBIO\nCat Murdock is a Security Analyst with GuidePoint Security's Threat and Attack Simulation team. For the last few years, she has worked on red teams predominantly as a social engineer. Murdock finds the space where privacy policies end and users' choice regarding their own privacy fascinating. Good intentions towards privacy only go so far, and there are many gaps in knowledge, ability, and/or desire that increase risk to individuals' privacy. She likes to explore where this interacts with organizations' established privacy policies. She also really likes dogs."
