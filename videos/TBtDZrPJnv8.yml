The profunctor representation exploits higher-order functions and higher-kinded type constructor classes. The relationship with the \"\"getter\"\" and \"\"setter\"\" functions is not at all obvious; it turns out to be a fairly direct application of the Yoneda Lemma, arguably the most important result in category theory. This talk will explain the Yoneda Lemma, with many concrete examples, including profunctor optics.\n\nSlides & full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/jeremy-gibbons/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - JEREMY GIBBONS\n\n\nJeremy Gibbons is Professor of Computing at the University of Oxford, where he teaches on the part-time professional master's programme in software engineering. He has been devoted to functional programming since the late eighties; he is Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Functional Programming, and his particular interests are in patterns in functional programming and in reasoning about programs.\n\nMore on Jeremy Gibbons: https://codesync.global/speaker/jeremy-gibbons/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE MESH LDN 19\nCode Mesh LDN is powered by Code Sync.
