title: 'Scott Tries Render.com Again'
recordingDate: 1608764039
description: "After some time has passed, Render.com seems to have really matured into an awesome platform. Iâ€™m retiring my previous Render.com video and am now a huge fan. So much so, that Render may just become our new hosting platform full time.\n\nI want to stress that this is not sponsored in any way. I am paying for Render.com with our own credit card. We do not have any affiliate tracking or payment for my opinions."
