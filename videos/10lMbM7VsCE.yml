description: "Every year, the Eclipse simultaneous release brings together the hard work of dozens of open source projects into a single coordinated release. Most people think of Eclipse as a Java IDE; for the IDE crowd, this yearâ€™s Luna release introduces changes in the look and feel of Eclipse, Java 8 support, enhanced content assist, and more. This session walks through some of the new IDE features and surveys some of the other technology being developed by open source projects at Eclipse, including application frameworks, runtime technology, and modeling tools.\n\n\nAuthor:\nWayne Beaton\nWayne is the Director of Open Source Projects at the Eclipse Foundation. He spends his days working with the many Eclipse projects, learning about Eclipse technology, and making sure that everybody knows just how cool it all really is. When not working, he can usually be found watching his kids play hockey at one of the many local arenas.\nView more trainings by Wayne Beaton at https://www.parleys.com/author/wayne-beaton\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
