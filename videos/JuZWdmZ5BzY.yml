description: "Talk recording from AmsterdamJS March 2019 Meetup https://www.meetup.com/AmsterdamJS/events/259124456/\n\nSome JavaScript professionals do not know CSS as well as they’d like to. In order to help them, PPK decided to write a book “CDD for JavaScripters”, where he will explain CSS in terms that JavaScripters will understand.\n\nBut what are those terms? What kind of teaching would JavaScripters expect? Is there a CSS mental model that is different from a JavaScript mental model? Is CSS a programming language? Does that matter for teaching or learning CSS?\n\nPPK will give a brief outline of where he’s standing right now on these questions. The majority of the session will be used for a discussion with the audience. How should he teach CSS? Why is it so hard for some to understand it? What are the least-understood parts of CSS? We hope this discussion will yield valuable feedback."
