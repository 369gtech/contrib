description: "How organizations prevent themselves from being Agile\r\n\nThe goal of this topic is to cover (or uncover) three common anti-patterns during Agile adoption by organizations. There are many common anti-patterns I have observed in organizations during implementing Agile mindset and Scrum framework. Let’s focus on three of them.\r\n\n\r\n\nMagdalena is sharing her experience from the last 12 years of Agile adoption. She has been observing many patterns and she would like to share the three – in her opinion, the most important ones. Her observation is that organizations declare they would like to “be” Agile, however, at the same time they sabotaging this decision to avoid as many changes as they can."
