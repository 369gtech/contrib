description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nTSDB Data Compactions on Scale Without Headache: Now & Future - Ben Ye, ByteDance\n\nData compaction is common in modern databases. The same happens in most Prometheus-based systems like Thanos, Cortex and Prometheus itself. Compaction plays an important role in those systems, improving query performance and storage usage significantly. In this talk, Ben will explain how compaction works in TSDB and how TSDB-based compactor works with object storage. Audiences will learn about the challenges of operating compactions on scale and how to mitigate those issues. Next, Ben will introduce the new improvements that were contributed to this space and new toolings that rewrite TSDB blocks. Last but not least, Ben will outline the future work that is planned to improve compactions in the Prometheus ecosystem further."
