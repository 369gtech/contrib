description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nDeep Dive Into API Machinery - Antoine Pelisse, Google & Stefan Schimanski, Red Hat \n\nSIG API Machinery is responsible for all generic API topics in Kubernetes, i.e. for the generic API server implementation, API CRUD semantics, discovery, the admission control mechanism, conversion, defaulting, persistence with etcd, general controllers like garbage collection, Go client libraries, code generation and extension points like CustomResourceDefinitions, aggregation & admission. This session will have two parts: A deep dive into a selection for API Machinery topics, probably: defining API types in Golang, groups+versions+kinds+resources, tags, code-generation, schemes, different variants of codecs â€“ and how to use all this with CustomResourceDefinitions and a custom client-go client. time for general discussion and opportunity for API machinery questions. This session is targetted especially at: People using the Kubernetes APIs with client-go and wanting to understand what is going on behind the scenes People extending Kubernetes with APIs using aggregated API servers or CustomResourceDefinitions \n\nhttps://sched.co/Uahb"
