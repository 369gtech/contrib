description: "Implementing graph representation model for parallel and distributed systems using Erlang\n\nThe report describes basic concepts of graph representation model specially designed for parallel and distributed systems. Hierarchy and main advantages of the model are given. Main disadvantages of traditional representation models are also given. Experimental part describes results of few series of experiments regarding to basic graph operations. Examples are based on experience of theoretical research and practical tasks gained in BMSTU, subdepartment of computer systems and networks. Conclusions contain analysis of applicability the model for different classes of problems."
