description: "Presented by Lawrence Lau at JSLA (js.la) on Thursday June 25th 2015 - React is created for building large web applications with data that changes in response to actions over time. This is exactly what many of our user-facing products are doing. Yet like many other application frameworks, scalability and maintainability are not inherent, because you are still free to organize your application as long as you follow the unidirectional flow. This talk will share lessons learned from my React application development with code samples at different stages of the unidirectional flow with the goal to truly take advantage of React to build a scalable and maintainable application.\n\n* twitter.com/ktslwy\n* github.com/ktslwy"
