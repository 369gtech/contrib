description: "PyData Cyprus Meetup - April 2021\n\n\nAbstract\n------------\nPredictions are needed for planning, scheduling, supply chain and similar decisions concerned with future, uncertain events and is the role of forecasting to provide such predictions to allow making these decisions as rationally and efficiently as possible. This talk discusses the many challenges facing the field and describes how the M competitions have offered objective, empirical evidence to guide the theory and practice of forecasting towards methods that are both more accurate while, at the same time, estimating uncertainty more realistically.\n\n\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
