description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nMulti-Tenant Clusters with Hierarchical Namespaces - Adrian Ludwin, Google \n\nThe multi-tenancy working group is developing new building blocks in Kubernetes to better support multi-tenant use cases, such as hosting multiple teams in large enterprises and enabling multi-single-tenant deployments in SaaS. Namespaces are one of the most important foundations of multi-tenancy in Kubernetes. In this talk, we introduce a new building block called Hierarchical Namespaces that allow policies like RBAC and Network Policies to be consistently inherited across trees of namespaces. Based on our experience working with customers, we believe this new technique will simplify namespace management in Enterprise and SaaS use cases. This talk will show how you can use hierarchical namespaces to safely and easily share your cluster across teams and deployments within an organization. Hierarchical Namespaces are an open source project currently incubating in the Multi-tenancy working group. You can check out the code and get involved in the project here: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/multi-tenancy/tree/master/incubator/hnc\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zeuh"
