description: "What we talk about when we talk about Distributed Systems \n\nSlides and more info: http://www.erlang-factory.com/euc2015/alvaro-videla\n\nDistributed Systems are a complex topic. There's abundant research about it but sometimes it is hard for a beginner to know where to start. I would like to outline the main concepts of distributed systems, so the interested person can have a clear path on how to start their own research as well. In this talk I will review the different models: asynchronous vs. synchronous distributed systems; message passing vs shared memory communication; failure detectors and leader election problems; consensus and different kind of replication. I will also review a series of books on distributed systems in order to recommend the best one according to the topics we would like to learn about, or the problems we would like to solve. The goal of the talk is to set a good foundation for people interested in learning more about distributed systems.\n\nTalk objectives:\nWhen learning about Distributed Systems there are lot of books and papers to chose from, with many of them having titles that are hard to understand. It's difficult then to judge their relevance to our interests if we don't know the topic already. The goal of the talk is to lay a common ground for Distributed Systems so everyone can benefit from the current research on the topic.\n\nTarget audience:\n- People starting to learn about Distributed Systems.\n- Engineers that need to work on Distributed Systems but have little experience reading the literature on the topic.\n\nAlvaro Videla works at Pivotal as a RabbitMQ Developer. Before moving to Europe he used to work in Shanghai where he helped building one of Germany biggest dating websites. He co-authored the book \"\"RabbitMQ in Action\"\" for Manning Publishing. Some of his open source projects can be found here: http://github.com/videlalvaro. Apart from code related stuff he likes traveling with his wife, listening/playing music and reading books."
