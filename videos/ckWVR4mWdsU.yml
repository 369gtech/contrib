description: "Do you follow Agile processes like Scrum, Kanban or XP... and yet struggling to deliver on time, under budget and without last-minute heroics? Why aren't these supposedly best practices working for you?\n\nIt is often said that a developer should understand one level deeper than she's working at. We understand this about our tech, but what about our practices? In this talk, we will dive \"one level deeper\" into some common agile/scrum/XP practices, and understand what it takes to make them work:\n\nSprints and velocity\nXP and dev pairing\nCode reviews - to do or not to do?\nPull requests - agile or fragile?\nStory points - estimation or guess-timation?"
