description: "by James Shubin\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/H.1308/graph_mgmt_config.webm\n\n\nMgmt is a real-time automation tool that is fast and safe. It works by running a DAG (graph) of resources.\nThe DAG is built in real-time, by running a graph-based DSL (language).\nWe'll fill this talk with a number of exciting real-time demos that show how some cleverly applied graph algorithms can solve an incredibly difficult set of problems.\nWe'll finish this off by including a demo of building a real-time, distributed, finite state machine (a distributed graph) using our tool.
