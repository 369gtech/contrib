description: "Andreas Weigend (PhD Physics 1991, Stanford University; Diplom Physik, Philosophie 1986, Universitaet Bonn) is an Associate Professor of Information Systems at the Stern School of Business, New York University. He came to Stern from the University of Colorado at Boulder where he had founded the Time Series Analysis Group, after working at Xerox PARC (Palo Alto Research Center) on knowledge discovery. At the Santa Fe Institute, he co-directed the Time Series Prediction Competition that led to the volume Time Series Prediction: Forecasting the Future and Understanding the Past (1994, Addison Wesley).\n\nHis research focuses on basic methodologies for modeling and extracting knowledge from data and their application across different disciplines. He develops and integrates ideas and analytical tools from statistics and information theory with neural networks and other machine learning paradigms. His approach, basic science on real problems, emphasizes the importance of rigorous evaluations of new methods in data mining. His recent work uses computational intelligence to extract and understand hidden states in financial markets, and to exploit this information to improve density predictions. He has published about one hundred articles in scientific journals, books and conference proceedings. He co-edited four books including Decision Technologies for Financial Engineering   (1998, World Scientific).\n\nProf. Weigend received a Research Initiation Award by the National Science Foundation (NSF), a major grant by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR), a Junior Faculty Development Award by the University of Colorado and a NYU Curricular Development Challenge Grant for his innovative course Data Mining in Finance. This course covers the foundations of knowledge discovery, data mining, prediction and nonlinear modeling, as well as specific techniques including neural networks, graphical models, evolutionary programming and clustering techniques. It develops solutions to current problems in finance and includes integrated in-depth projects with major Wall Street firms.\n\nProf. Weigend organized the sixth international conference Computational Finance that took place at Stern on January 6-8, 1999, drawing more than 300 attendees. He has given tutorials and short executive courses on time series analysis, volatility prediction, nonlinear modeling, risk management and decision making under uncertainty and consulted for a broad spectrum of firms ranging from financial boutiques to Goldman Sachs, J. P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley and Nikko Securities."
