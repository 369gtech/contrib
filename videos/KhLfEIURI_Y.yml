title: 'YOW! 2020 Online - Nicolai Josuttis - Hidden Features and Traps of C++ Move Semantics'
language: English
recordingDate: 1624249581
description: "Move semantics, introduced with C++11, has become a hallmark of modern C++ programming. However, it also complicates the language in many ways. Even after several years of support, experienced programmers struggle with all details of move semantics.\nWhile I took the time to write up all the facts and details in my new book \"C++ Move Semantics - The Complete Guide\" (cppmove.com), I learned a lot I wasn't aware of (note that the final book has 260 pages).\nThis talk is about a very simple class to demonstrate some remarkable aspects of move semantics. We will see some tricky features and traps to understand C++ better.\nNicolai Josuttis is an independent systems architect, technical manager, author, and consultant. He designs mid-sized and\_large software systems for the telecommunication, traffic, finance, and manufacturing industries. He is well known in the C++ Community for speaking and writing with authority about C++ (being the author of\_The C++ Standard Library\_andC++ Templates) but is also an innovative presenter.\nHe is an active member of C++ standardization committee for almost 20 years now.\n\nFor more information on YOW!
