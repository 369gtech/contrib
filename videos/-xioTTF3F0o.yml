description: 'Numerous examples of containers (Docker, CoreOS), orchestration tools (Swarm, Kubernetes, Mesos), and cloud services (Cloud Foundry, Amazon, Azure, GCP) vie for our attention and implementations. The presenter discusses these technologies, compares them, and _deploys real applications to them LIVE_ to demonstrate subtle differences & tradeoffs each choice imposes upon developers. Seeing is believing; lively follow-on discussions are guaranteed!'
