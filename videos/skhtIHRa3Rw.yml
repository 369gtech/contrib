Do you know how to go from one to the other?\n\nDuring this workshop Kristian Muñoz, Software Craftsperson at Codurance,  is going to transform a VUE application from CSR to SSR without forgetting about TDD and the good practices.\nYou can just follow Kristian through his implementation during the session or follow each step by setting up your environment to work with VUE + NPM.\n\nThank you Kristian for this interesting webinar and live DEMO!\n\nResources:\nhttps://vuejs.org/v2/guide/installation.html#NPM and make sure you have access to this git repository\nhttps://github.com/kristianmzmz/from-csr-to-ssr/\n\nFor more information about Codurance, please visit our website: https://codurance.com/."
