description: "Effective business value-producing relationships between business and IT are only possible when both IT and business are proficient ‘dancing partners.’ And in practice, the business often has two left feet. How can IT help their business partners to become better dancing partners?\n\nThis is of particular importance in the ‘digital enterprise’ – which most private and public enterprises are, these days – where information and technology are integral parts of not only the business processes, but also the enterprise’s products and their customers’ experiences.\n\nIt takes two to tango and the digital enterprise requires effective leadership from business managers, as well as efficient service delivery from the IT function.\n\nInteractive (fun!) part: attendees will be invited to share their thoughts on desired behaviour between business and IT, after which their findings will be compared with results from previous sessions.\n\nKey takeaways\nHow the digital enterprise is shaking up IT’s operating model\nAn understanding of the business’ role as digital leader\nHow to talk about IT with business people\nHow to achieve more productive business-IT collaboration\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
