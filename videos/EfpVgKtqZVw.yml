description: "Docker is not just about deploying containers to hundreds of servers. Developers need tools that help with day-to-day tasks and to do their job more effectively.

Docker can help take care of many problems developers face during development such as “it works on my machine” as well as keeping tooling consistent between all of the people working on a project.
