title: 'One control to rule them all by Gerrit Grunwald'
recordingDate: 1519313108
description: "MultiDevice controls are capable of adjusting their appearance according to the device they are running on (desktop, mobile). In addition the idea was to improve the user experience in a way that one can use a mobile device to enter data into your desktop software. You can think of an extension that makes it possible to use the capabilities like touch etc. of your mobile device to set parameters on your desktop software. To give you an idea we prepared a little demo that will show the possibilities of that concept. For the demo we make use of a JavaFX application but the concept could also be implemented in JavaScript etc.\n\nGerrit Grunwald, Canoo Engineering AG\nGerrit Grunwald is a developer/evangelist with more than ten years of experience in software development.
