description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nWhere to Put All That YAML: Secure Content Management for Cloud Native Apps - Ryan Abrams, Mirantis \n\nAn important part of the CI/CD toolchain for cloud-native apps is managing the content. In addition to your actual source code, container images and Helm Charts and Kubernetes Object YAMLs are all part of bringing apps into production. They are your intellectual property and must be managed carefully.  The OCI distribution spec under the Linux Foundation was originally designed for container images, but the manifest and index definitions in the spec are quite flexible. This means it’s possible to support newer artifact types using the OCI distribution spec, including Helm Charts, build caches, snapshots and other YAML files, with some minor modifications, leveraging the same OCI-compliant registries to support more than just containers.  In this talk, Ryan Abrams will discuss the common traits of different configuration formats and how you can use existing tools to support them.\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zeiq"
