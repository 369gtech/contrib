description: "Speaker: Kang Sheng Tay, Software Engineer at Shopify\r\nTopic: Behind The Gems 4 :: 6\r\n***\r\nWe are inviting makers from the Ruby community to share with us their journey and what they have built. For this month, Kang Sheng will be sharing some of his learnings when building YetAnotherYear. YetAnotherYear is a New Year's Resolutions app that literally lets you keep track of your new year's resolutions. In this talk, he will be focusing on his learnings trying to build a fully functional SPA on Rails. Rails cookie auth for your SPA? Serve assets with Rails to be used in SPA? Managing OAuth using Rails for SPA? Yes, Rails can still do most of the heavy lifting so that he can just manage 1 Heroku instance 🤷‍♂️\r\n***\r\nThis event is brought to you by RubySG.
