description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io\_The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nBring Batch Capability Into Kubernetes, Using AI and Big Data as an Example - Da Ma, Huawei \n\nKubernetes started as a general purpose orchestration framework with a focus on serving jobs. But as it gains popularity, users want to run batch workload on Kubernetes, such as Spark, TensorFlow, etc. When running these batch workloads in a multitenant systme like Kubernetes, advanced scheduling features such as fair-share scheduling become more classes of batch & elastic workload including: machine learning/deep learning, bioinformatics/genomics and other \"big data\" appications. These types of applications typically run on generalized domain frameworks like TensorFlow, Spark, PyTorch, MPI, etc., which Volcano inegrates with. This talk is bring light to this new CNCF project, the feature it provides with concrete examples, and the next steps and how to get involved. \n\nhttps://sched.co/dIKw"
