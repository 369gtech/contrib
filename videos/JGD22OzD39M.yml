title: 'DEFCON 29 IoT Village - Messdaghi and Eddy - Representation Matters'
language: English
recordingDate: 1630443229
description: "We often hear about the importance of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) and how companies are striving to do better. However, there are plenty of examples where DEI that is being promoted is not actually happening behind scenes. Stories of those who are marginalized in tech showcasing we still have a large problem with companies practicing lip service and no actual actions to show for it. One way to see if a company is trying to be better on DEI is reflected on the board and C-suite. Yet, still to this day less than 20% of company boards represent marginalized identities. \n\nIt's time to increase representation of marginalized identities from less than 20% to 50%+ for all levels in tech. When we shift to incorporating DEI practices by making sure representation is present on the leadership team, board and c-suite, it recognizes the voices of marginalized identities: ethnicities, genders, generations, sexuality, and abilities. \nResearch has repeatedly shown that when we have diverse boards and c-level positions held by marginalized persons, it produces a trickle down effect. Where the company takes actions and voices are finally heard because thereâ€™s representation, and it's reflected in the vision, company policies, and hiring practices.\n\nThis talk discusses why we need representation on the leadership team, and how to get involved to actually bring a change to an industry that has run out of time to become more inclusive."
