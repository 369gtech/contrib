title: 'Agile Adria 2013 / Mitja Mavsar: Inside Users Mind'
language: English
recordingDate: 1372977328
description: "UX is usually defined as a part of the development process but Mitja thinks we should take a break, redefine it and build it from user's perspective. During his session he will tackle the following questions:\n- What happens if engineers use their gut feeling and don't involve users in the design and development process?\n- What's going on in user's head during first impression, usage, decision making and sharing?\n- How to use user research, journeys, card sorting and usability testing in the agile way?\nI know that UX is not one of the big topics of this year, but I think this talk fits in with the rest of the conference. It is very hands-on and it demistifys the how to do agile UX question."
