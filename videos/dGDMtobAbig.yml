description: "In this ver. @csell5 talks to @faziodev about the current state of ai assistants. Really, how different are these platforms, are they even useful yet, dare we say smart? Will they ever be? Warning, mute Alexa or toilet paper will be purchased.\n\nFazio is a Senior Software Engineer with Skyline Technologies, where he helps clients solve all kinds of problems in the web, mobile, and cloud spaces. Fazio is also an organizing committee member for Chicago Code Camp and Milwaukee Code Camp, as well as a presenter at user groups, code camps, and That Conference. Fazio has a love of all things mobile, voice assistants, JavaScript, and REST APIs. Outside of technology, he's always up for a chat about board games, video games, baseball, and late-90s metal bands.\n\nLinks from today's show\n\nhttps://ai.googleblog.com/2018/05/duplex-ai-system-for-natural-conversation.html"
