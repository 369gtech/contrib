description: "http://www.cppcon.org\nâ€”\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2014\n--\nDive into and follow along making a lock-free queue.\n\nIn particular, a multi-producer, multi-consumer, growing, shrinking, mostly contiguous, lock-free circular queue.\n\nWith this single (complicated!) example, we will come across, and attempt to solve, many of the typical problems found in lockfree programming, and delve into the pros and cons of various solutions to those problems.\n--\nTony Van Eerd has been coding for well over 25 years, and hopefully coding well for at least some of that. Most of that time has been in the graphics/video/film/broadcast industry (at Inscriber/Adobe), writing low level pixel++, high level UI, as well as threading and everything else in between. He now works at BlackBerry, watching over the BlackBerry APIs. He is also the company-wide \"C++ guy\" writing half of his code in emails and wiki pages.\n--\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
