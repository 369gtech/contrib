title: 'Splunk as a Big Data Platform for Developers'
recordingDate: 1363191616
description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2012.\nSpeaker: Damien Dallimore\nSplunk is a Big Data platform that transforms the massive amount of heterogeneous and often totally unstructured machine data being generated across the enterprise into valuable insights and realtime operational intelligence.\n\nSplunk exposes a rich REST API that covers every feature in the product, and we have several language SDKS to enable developers to leverage the power of the Splunk platform.\n\nIn this session I'll demonstrate how developers can use the Splunk Java SDK to :\n\n1) easily and rapidly create big data applications without the need to write Map Reduce jobs\n\n2) integrate Splunk search results with your existing applications\n\n3) augment the operational visibility of the JVM apps you are building via the variety of data sources you can send to Splunk\n\n4) use Splunk as a powerful tool throughout your development process to enhance the quality of the software you are pushing into production"
