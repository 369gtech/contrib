Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe in Barcelona, May 20–23 (https://bit.ly/2B2vhMl), in Shanghai, June 24–26 (https://bit.ly/2JZcBjs), or in San Diego November 18–21 (https://bit.ly/2K031wW) in 2019. \n\nHandling Edge Cloud Network Using “KubeEdgeBus” - Yulin Sun & Weijin Xu, Huawei\n\nEdge Cloud network is very different than a typical Data Center networking environment. For example, Edge compute nodes typically run behind NAT and all traffic goes through unreliable and low performance Internet environment. Kubernetes container network and Service Mesh are designed for datacenter environment and may not meet all the requirements of Edge Cloud environment.  This presentation will review “KubeEdgeBus” design proposal in support of multi-tenant Edge Cloud environment. “KubeEdgeBus” provides development experience for Edge Cloud similar to a typical Datacenter environment. “KubeEdgeBus” provides support for exposing HTTP service running at the Edge node as well as optimized routing for data traffic between edges running within the same private network and across networks.  The presentation will walk-through all of the above using a user case study. \n\nTo learn more click here:  https://sched.co/FuK1"
