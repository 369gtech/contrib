description: "Creating a high-performance C++ application is a multi-level problem, not just about applying a set of low-level tweaks.\n\nThis talk covers a range of design issues such as the key role of domain knowledge, the choice of data structures and algorithms, memory allocation, modern machines and caches, the use of move semantics and various approaches to string handling. All this and some measurement too. Wow."
