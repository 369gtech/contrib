description: "Evolving Legacy Systems into Kubernetes at Lyft: A Hybrid Environment - Lita Cho & Jose Nino, Lyft \n\nBefore Kubernetes, Lyft has hundreds services that deployed as VMs in AWS. Moving over to Kubernetes is a big undertaking. This talk will go over how we leveraged Envoy and the go-control-plane (the service that hosts Envoy configuration and discovery API) to split traffic between our legacy infrastructure and our Kubernetes infrastructure. This talk will demonstrate how Lyft handled service discovery within our hybrid environment, various ways to control the traffic when Kubernetes issues came up, and how Lyft used Envoy as a sidecar container to keep in par with the legacy behavior. Lastly, this talk will discuss the various challenges we faced with this migration plan but why it was needed due to the size of Lyftâ€™s legacy infrastructure. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/GrS1"
