description: "PyData Warsaw 2018\n\nSemantic segmentation is the process which aims to classify individual pixels of an image. Recently, Kaggle hosted the 2018 Data Science Bowl competition dedicated to nucleus detection and segmentation based on microscopic images. In this talk, I will present two approaches to this problem, based on U-Net and Mask R-CNN.\n===\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
