description: 'Since the past 10 years, the Blender (blender.org) team has been developing and using a complete open source creation pipeline. The team produced and released several short films, including a 360- degrees VR experience and a pitch for the feature animation "Agent 327". Developing and sharing open source technologies is a great challenge, and leads to great benefits for the small and medium animation studios. In his talk, Francesco will show one of the most compelling and inspiring examples of production-driven software development.'
