description: "Repo - https://github.com/fonnesbeck/mcmc_pydata_london_2019\n\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is the most common approach for performing Bayesian data analysis. MCMC is a general class of algorithms that uses simulation to estimate a variety of statistical models. This tutorial will introduce users how to use MCMC for fitting statistical models using PyMC3, a Python package for probabilistic programming.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
