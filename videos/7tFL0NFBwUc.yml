title: '"OpenZFS and Linux" - Nikolai Lusan (LCA 2020)'
recordingDate: 1579146249
description: "Nikolai Lusan\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/110/\n\nOpenZFS has come a long way in recent times, and with the deprecation of BTRFS we are not likely to see a filesystem with comparative feature set anytime soon.  The ZoL (ZFS on Linux) project is now the main source of contributions to the OpenZFS code base, and is incredibly stable and robust. With OpenZFS now supporting native encryption it can simplify management of you data storage from the mdadm/luks/lvm method commonly seen deployed. Other features can improve performance and allow more efficient usage of disk storage. Whether you're storing personal files, hosting a development environment/webserver/email/database, running a virtual host, holding large amounts of corporate data there is probably a ZFS usage case for you.\r\n\r\nThis talk aims to give an outline of installing, using and administering a Linux server with ZFS as the root filesystem and for data storage. This includes:\r\n   * Caveats of installation and use. \r\n   * Benefits of ZFS.\r\n   * Designing/Managing storage pools.\r\n   * Demonstration of pool creation using different disk topologies.\r\n   * Using features like native encryption, block level compression, and database optimisation.\r\n   * Using snapshots, including for off site backup.\r\n   * ZFS and other Linux filesystems on one machine.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
