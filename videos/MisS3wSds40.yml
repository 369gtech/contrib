description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nTutorial: Getting Started With Cloud Native Security - Liz Rice, Aqua Security & Michael Hausenblas, Amazon \n\nThis tutorial will get you off the ground with Kubernetes security basics, using live demos and examples to work through yourself.  We’ll start with possible attack vectors, to help you map out the threat model that applies to your cluster, so you can figure out where you need to focus your efforts for security.  We’ll show you how to compromise a deployment with a pod running with a known vulnerability. Once you’ve had the attacker’s eye-view, we’ll walk you through the most important techniques and open source tools to prevent compromise.  · Using secure Kubernetes settings · Including vulnerability scanning in your workflow · Configuring pods to run securely (eg avoiding unnecessary privileges) · Using GitOps to restrict user access to your cluster and provide an audit trail  You’ll leave this tutorial armed with practical actions for securing your deployment.\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zekj"
