description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nOptimized Resource Allocation in Kubernetes? Topology Manager is Here - Conor Nolan, Intel & Victor Pickard, Red Hat \n\nTo satisfy the resource demands of workloads, Kubernetes must be responsible for resources on the platform and the intricacies associated with them. The introduction of CPU Manager and Device Manager are two examples of K8s taking involved decisions for resource assignment. However, these two components act independently, which can lead to undesirable resource allocations most notable on a systems with multiple CPU Socket or NUMA Regions.  Under the guidance of SIG node, a new component is being introduced to Kubelet called Topology Manager, which will resolve this undesirable situation by enabling optimal resource allocation. This talk will introduce Topology Manager, how it works to solve these problems as well as the reasons behind introducing such a feature.\n\nhttps://sched.co/b6KQ"
