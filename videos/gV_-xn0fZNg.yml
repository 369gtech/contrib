recordingDate: 1410889422
description: "From the 2014 Velocity Conference in New York City.\n\nWhy isn’t the US Men’s soccer team dominating the world of soccer? The US has more money and people than the top 5 countries in the FIFA Rankings. So why doesn’t US soccer dominate the FIFA rankings? (US is ranked at 13) It turns out that it may have to a lot to do with a interconnected knowledge network from the world’s best soccer leagues. There are a lot of parallels to this and struggling IT organizations. In this talk I’d like to discuss how open source communities and meetups have served a valuable part in fostering that interconnected knowledge network and practical ways to cultivate this network within organizations.\n\nThis keynote is sponsored by Rackspace\n\nAbout John Yi (Rackspace):\nI started in the IT Automation space working for Opsware and became fascinated with the automation of infrastructure. When Opsware was acquired by HP, I found a home with the good folks at WebMD and worked on automating their infrastructure. Their I learned some of the ideas of DevOps and the clever ways this has been used to create products and services faster in IT. Cloud being a great tool to facilitate automation led me to Openstack and Rackspace.\n\nWatch more from the 2014 Velocity New York Conference: http://goo.gl/kmrqJF\nFind out more about Velocity: http://velocityconf.com/\n\nDon't miss an upload!
