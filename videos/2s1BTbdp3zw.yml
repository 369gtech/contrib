description: 'AI is New Electricity and Deep Learning is one of key enablers for this, it breaks known limits of possible and disrupts vast areas of our modern life. From dev standpoint it sounds science-heavy and requires PhD in fact its not. Here I’m going to explain why in theory and practice with Kotlin. Kotlin is a modern language with great perspectives to write concise, safe and interoperable applications, while Deep Learning is something what we’re going to develop in the nearest future. So why not to combine those 2 powers into 1?'
