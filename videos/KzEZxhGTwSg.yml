title: 'Jemima Abu - Building Accessible Components in React'
language: English
recordingDate: 1620028827
description: "\"This talk aims to address the best way to build accessible and reusable components in React.\n\nWhen writing in JSX or building reusable components, it's tempting to wrap everything in a div tag and call it a day.\nHowever, this is kinda like labeling every can in your fridge 'food'; it may be easier but it's definitely not the best approach.\nIn this talk, we'll focus on the use of Semantic HTML, managing user interaction and navigation, writing unobtrusive JavaScript functions, and dealing with route changes. We'll also learn about tools for accessibility testing. Finally, we'll cover the importance of accessibility and why it should always come first when building a site (hint: because the web is for everyone so everyone should be able to use it).\""
