After the first try, I realize I can perform something with PHP could be impossible to do, like better resources control, real-time coverage or even use websockets. In 2016 Bragful project was created.\n\nSlides & full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/manuel-rubio/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - MANUEL RUBIO\nPolyglot Developer, Manager and Coach\n\nManuel is a developer since he was 12 years old (26 years ago) and he started with Basic, like others, but later also with Modula-2, Pascal, C, Assembler and these before 20 years old.
