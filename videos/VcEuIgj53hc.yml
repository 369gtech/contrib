Just email us at neverbeen@fitc.ca for a VERY special offer!\n\nMotion design (or “motion graphics,” if you prefer) sits at the busy intersection of graphic design, animation and filmmaking. Inextricably linked to technology, the discipline of motion design is constantly evolving, adapting to emerging media while pushing the boundaries of storytelling and communication.\n\nDrawing on his 15 years as an enthusiast and professional working in the field of motion design, Justin Cone (founder of Motionographer), will gaze into his crystal ball and share his divinations with you. Expect practical, entertaining and possibly challenging insights. Also expect cats.\n\nJustin Cone\nCo-founder, Motionographer\nhttps://twitter.com/motionographer\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
