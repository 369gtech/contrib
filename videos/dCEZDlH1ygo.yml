description: "Blake Matheny approaches his talk at NEScala with a collection of trial-and-error experiences he's acquired as the VP of Engineering at Tumblr (who for the past year and half has adopted Scala as their primary backend development language). Blake draws on actual code used at Tumblr, describes their implications in a server context, and shows us where things have gone wrong and how they were corrected.\n \nThis talk will be most pertinent to engineers who build backend service applications, but should be of interest to anyone looking to find additional methods for troubleshooting code in Scala.\n\n** Visit our site for more content on Scala, including the rest of the presentations from NE Scala 2013: http://marakana.com/s/tags/scala"
