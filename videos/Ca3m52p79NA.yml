description: "Shaun Smith, Director of Product Management--Serverless, Oracle\nDavid Delabassee, Software Evangelist, Oracle\n\nServerless functions are hot, and developer and corporate interest is exploding! But let’s face it, although Java is one of the top two programming languages in the world, it isn’t the most popular language for writing functions—at least not yet. According to James Governor, “When web companies grow up, they turn into Java shops,” so as functions become mainstream, will Java become the dominant language for authoring functions? Can it be? This session examines the challenges to using Java for functions and the latest Java platform features that address them. It also digs into the open source Fn project’s unparalleled Java support, which makes it possible to build, test, and scale out Java-based functions applications."
