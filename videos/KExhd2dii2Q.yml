description: "It is already more than a year since the reference implementation of JAX-RS 2.0 provided by Jersey 2.0 was released. Besides the JAX-RS 2.0 standard API, Jersey implementation provides many additional features such as security; JSON binding support; integration with various containers and client transports (Grizzly, AHC, Jetty, ...); support for server-sent events (SSE); MVC view templates (analogous to .NET Razor templates); EclipseLink MOXy integration, with all its bells and whistles (JSON and XML bindings, custom object graphs, externalized descriptors ...), and so on. This session takes an in-depth look at these cool Jersey features that address additional use cases not covered by the standard JAX-RS API.\n\n\nAuthors:\nJakub Podle코치k\nJakub works on project Jersey, a production quality reference implementation of JAX-RS API (RESTful web services in Java). \nHe regularly speaks at various international conferences (JavaOne, Jazoon, GeeCON, SUN/Oracle TechDays) and is also co-leading the Czech Java User Group.\nView more trainings by Jakub Podle코치k at https://www.parleys.com/author/jakub-podlesak-4\n\n Miroslav Fuksa\nI am a Java developer in Oracle and I work in the Jersey team. I develop Jersey 2.x which provides JAX-RS 2.0 reference implementation. As a team member I am responsible for all areas of Jersey development including architecture, design and development of new features, bug fixing, testing and interaction with Jersey community. My area of specialization is the security. I have added support for OAuth 1 and 2 into Jersey 2.x and I had a session about security in JAX-RS at Java One 2013.\n\nI have joined Jersey team in Oracle in 2012. Before I worked as a developer developing Java enterprise applications. I have been working with Java since 2005.\nView more trainings by  Miroslav Fuksa at https://www.parleys.com/author/miroslav-fuksa-4\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
