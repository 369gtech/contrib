description: "This video was recorded at Code Mesh V 2020 - https://codesync.global/conferences/code-mesh-ldn/\n\nMore great virtual tech conferences - https://codesync.global \n\n---\n\nCloudstate Towards Stateful Serverless \nby James Roper, Jonas Boné\n\nABSTRACT\nThe Serverless experience is revolutionary and will grow to dominate the future of Cloud. Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) however—with its ephemeral, stateless, and short-lived functions—is only the first step. FaaS is great for processing-intensive, parallelizable workloads, moving data from A to B providing enrichment and transformation along the way. But it is quite limited and constrained in what use-cases it addresses well, which makes it very hard/inefficient to implement general-purpose application development and distributed systems protocols.\n\nWhat’s needed is a next-generation Serverless platform and programming model for general-purpose application development in the new world of real-time data and event-driven systems. What is missing is ways to manage distributed state in a scalable and available fashion, support for long-lived virtual stateful services, ways to physically co-locate data and processing, and options for choosing the right data consistency model for the job.\n\nThis talk will discuss the challenges, requirements, and introduce you to our proposed solution: Cloudstate—an Open Source project building the next generation Stateful Serverless and leveraging state models such as Event Sourcing, CQRS, and CRDTs, running on Akka, gRPC, Kubernetes, and GraalVM, in a polyglot fashion with support for Go, JavaScript, Java, Swift, Scala, Python, Kotlin, and more.\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - Jonas Bonér\nEntrepreneur, hacker, powder skier, obsessive reader, jazz fanatic, occasional writer and public speaker. \n\nFounder and CTO of Lightbend, building a platform and runtime for Reactive Systems.\n\nActive contributor to the Open Source community; most notably created the Akka Project and the AspectWerkz Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) compiler. \n\nTHE SPEAKER - James Roper\nJames is a long time open source contributor and Reactive systems expert. He is the creator of Cloudstate, the framework that brings distributed state management to the serverless world. He also created the Lagom Reactive microservices framework and is a core contributor to Play Framework.\n\n---\n\nCode Mesh V\nWebsite: https://codesync.global/conferences/code-mesh-ldn/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/CodeMeshio"
