The challenge becomes much more complicated when dealing with multiple models, with data that is changing over time, on a massive scale.\nIn our talk, we will focus on one of Salesforce Einsteinâ€™s widely-used products - Opportunity Scoring. We will describe the data science challenges as well as our solutions for monitoring our models' performance. We will also deep dive into specific quality metrics and real-world examples from thousands of customers.\n\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.
