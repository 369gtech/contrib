description: "Nostalgia is at the heart of image processing. Many Instagram filters mimic the quirks of old film and instant cameras. Now that digital imagery has been around for a while, glitching from data corruption can totally be a retro aesthetic, too!\n\nThis talk covers different image formats, including Bitmap and JPEG, how they are structured differently, how images can be compressed using frequency space transforms to shrink an image to 1/10 the original file size with little detectable change. All of this leads up to how we can corrupt image data to produce glitching effects, with different techniques depending on the file format, and demo some code written to produce the most artistic glitch effects possible.\n\nSpeaker: Amy Wibowo"
