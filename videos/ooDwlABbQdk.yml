description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io\n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\n“KubeGene” a Genome Sequencing Workflow Management Framework - Shenjun Tang, Huawei\n\nIn the recent years, exponential growth of genetic data makes it hard for researchers to do analysis on a traditional computers. In this presentation, Tangshengjun will provide an overview of “KubeGene” a bio-genetic management framework built on top of Kubernetes platform for managing TB/PB of data deployed across a cluster with hundreds of nodes. “KubeGene” supports data-processing pipelines for Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS), Whole Exome Sequencing (WES), liquid biopsy, single cell sequencing and other sequencing scenarios with best practices, like Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK), on the Kubernetes cluster. Furthermore, “KubeGene” can easily deploy a cluster-based data-science platform for data-mining based on the processed data. In conclusion, “KubeGene” provides users with full-stack, easy-to-use, scalable bio-genetic cloud computing solution.\n\nTo learn more click here: https://sched.co/FuKj"
