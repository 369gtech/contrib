description: "Monitoring Cloud Foundry Infrastructure and Applications with Stackdriver and BigQuery [I] - Jeff Johnson, Google    \n\nCreate a single pane of glass for your Cloud Foundry deployment, search through application logs, and be alerted on errors with Stackdriver Logging and Monitoring. This talk will look at the open source Stackdriver Nozzle developed by Google and Pivotal and walk through useful features for operators and developers alike including the ability to stream logs into Stackdriver.\n\nJeff Johnson\nJeff is a Software Engineer at Google who is giving developers super powers by integrating the tools that run Google with open source Cloud Foundry. He has worked closely with the excellent engineers at Pivotal on the stackdriver-tools BOSH release to integrate Google's Logging, Monitoring, Tracing, and Debugging with Cloud Foundry. Today he is working with Pivotal on bringing Kubernetes' container orchestration strengths to complement Cloud Foundry applications. Check out the Pivotal Cloud Foundry on Google Cloud Platform web series for a hint of what's to come."
