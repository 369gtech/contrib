description: "Jeff Szczepanski (Stack Overflow) - Scaling Software Development via the Agile / Waterfall Continuum\nThe speech was given on 2016-05-19 at infoShare 2016 (Tech Stage) in Gdańsk. http://infoshare.pl\n\nJeff is the Chief Operating Officer at Stack Overflow where, for the last 6 years, he has been running the business behind Stack Overflow's network of Q&A communities. In this role, therefore, Jeff is also the most likely person to be demoted or fired if Stack Overflow's monetization plans don’t continue to work out. Prior to joining Stack Overflow, Jeff was Founder and CTO of Allworx Corp which reached a successful exit in 2007. At Allworx, Jeff was head of product development for their line of VoIP hardware and software products, he was the lead on company strategy, and somehow even managed to continue to write and ship embedded C/C++ code, at least occasionally, through his full tenure there.\n\n\nFollow infoShare:\nhttps://facebook.com/infosharepl\nhttps://twitter.com/infosharepl\nhttps://www.instagram.com/infoshare/\nhttps://plus.google.com/+infoshare/"
