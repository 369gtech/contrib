description: "NYC Mesh is a community-run mesh network that helps over three-hundred homes connect to high-speed Internet; making it one of the largest mesh networks in the world. We work with anyone interested in reclaiming ownership over their Internet, but specifically engage with underserved populations including residents in low-income housing and community centers. Built by a combination of consumer-grade materials and donated fiber-optic cable, this network gives people ownership and control over their Internet usage.\n\nDigital empowerment does not end at the connection. At NYC Mesh, we teach members how to build and maintain the network themselves, resulting in a truly decentralized and resilient network. Our training program teaches members to lead node installations, a task that requires planning, critical thought, and cooperation from the team, giving our members an deeper appreciation for this utility.\n\nIn this talk, we will describe how we have applied the notion of decentralization both the technical and organizational design of the NYC Mesh. We will talk about why educating our community on the networking layer is essential in order to build a truly equitable Internet and how our training program helps develop informed users. We will also describe our goals for expanding the network and its potential for community building with hyper-localized websites and applications.\n\nMichael Donatz\nBloomberg LP\n@donutsonhudson\n\nMichael is a volunteer with NYC Mesh and the Out in Tech Digital Corps.
