description: 'Most organizational models are broken and very few employees can say they are empowered and trusted to do their jobs. Most professionals today want far more than a job—they want to develop their careers, be part of the decision making, and have the power to reshape the organization they work for, and most importantly, enjoy their work. In this talk Sandro will explain what Teal Organizations are and will describe some of the advantages and challenges of being part of a self-organized and self-managed company. He will be covering topics that include: complete flat structure, decentralized decision making, open financials, open salaries, recruitment, initiative circles, and cultural fit.'
