description: "Peribolos: How Kubernetes Uses GitOps to Manage GitHub Communities at Scale - Christoph Blecker, Red Hat & Erick Fejta, Google \n\nWith 6 organizations, 150+ repositories, 400+ GitHub teams, and 800+ unique members, the Kubernetes project has a massive GitHub footprint. Scaling this footprint without excessive manual toil or impacting project velocity is a challenge.    We addressed this challenge by defining our GitHub organization as configuration in a GitHub repository. We wrote tooling, which we called peribolos, that continually applies this config, including whenever we merge changes to it.    Peribolos is built on top of prow, the CI system the Kubernetes project built and runs on. We will show how it works, discuss some of its design decisions around delegation and safety and help you decide whether it can benefit your organization. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPZA"
