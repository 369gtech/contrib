description: "Like an alien invasion, everyone is telling you to use NgRx! You are fighting and resisting this Dark Lord mind-shift. What if you wanted to super-power your services without using NgRx?\n\nWith RxJS, you get all the super-powers of Observables and `data-push` features. And with View Facades + RxJS, you can radically simplify your view components; hiding all complexity in the Facades.\n\nBut designing these Facades can be tricky indeed!\n\nCome learn about Facades and the best-practices for Facade APIs. And then see where & how NgRx can be easily added [later] without affect any of your View components. See where Facades + NgRx are most beneficialâ€¦ and where NgRx is a perfect next-step, enhancement.\n\nng-conf is a three-day Angular conference focused on delivering the highest quality training in the Angular JavaScript framework. 1500+ developers from across the globe converge on Salt Lake City, UT every year to attend talks and workshops by the Angular team and community experts.\n\nFollow us on twitter https://twitter.com/ngconf\nOfficial Website: https://www.ng-conf.org/"
