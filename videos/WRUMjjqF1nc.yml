description: "❗️ATTENTION ❗️\nRegistration to 🚀DevTernity 2018 is running:\n✅ https://devternity.com\n\nTired of fancy abstractions without actual down to earth implementation? In this talk, we will go through some benefits of having an event-sourced model on a real example. This is full-time live coding and we will start with a simple Spring Boot based OOP application and turn it upside down with events. \nBasic knowledge of DDD and/or OOP is welcome!"
