title: 'Good, better, breast: Building a sensing mastectomy prosthetic with open hardware'
recordingDate: 1579213002
description: "Kathy Reid\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/16/\n\nIn Australia every year, around 18,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer [1]. Many will go on to have breast removal surgery, called a mastectomy. Only 12% of women who have a mastectomy will have reconstruction, and will instead opt to wear a silicon-based prosthetic. \r\n\r\nThese prosthetics are \"dumb\" - they're just silicone. They have 0 USB ports. What a great opportunity for open hardware!\r\n\r\nAs part of her term project in the Masters of Applied Cybernetics at the 3A Institute at The Australian National University, Kathy Reid, herself a breast cancer survivor, developed a prototype called \"SenseBreast\" - a sensing, smart, mastectomy prosthetic based on an RPi 3B+ and a Sense HAT. This was a \"mucking around\" project to learn Python, and she didn't expect it to work. \r\nNarrator: It worked. \r\n\r\nIn this poignant, funny, challenging, technical, entertaining and irreverent presentation, she explores; \r\n\r\n- motivations for the project, including a desire to keep sensor data private and personal - after all, who's watching? \r\n- hardware design and sensor challenges in open hardware and Python\r\n- prosthetic design and how to build a fake breast to contain hardware\r\n- lived experience wearing a smart prosthetic\r\n- implications for this technology, such as in post-mastectomy recovery \r\n- and reflections on the broader landscape of wearable technology\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] https://www.bcna.org.au/media/6101/bcna-2018-current-breast-cancer-statistics-in-australia-31jan2018.pdf\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
