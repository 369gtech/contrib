description: "Barry Hiern\nOracle\n\nWhile taking part in a conversation, the end user may enter information is any number of different formats, and while the use of a custom component allows the Chatbot developer to control how to respond to the input (and likewise format any response), this adds an additional complexity to the overall bot design; especially if the developer of the dialog flow, is a different individual to the one tasked with writing the custom component. This session will introduce the power of Apache Freemarker and how it is can be used, within the Oracle Intelligent Bot platform, to quickly and easily include static data, optimize dialog flow and display/format bot responses all without the need to develop dialog specific custom components."
