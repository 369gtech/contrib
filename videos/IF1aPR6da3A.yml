recordingDate: 1518703839
description: "Did you see that? C# 7.1? C# 7.2? While you were working and upgrading your .NET Core SDK and Visual Studio like normal, the C# team snuck in two point releases with several useful improvements to features you already love.\n\nIn this talk, you'll learn about all these features, and about a new setting that puts you in control of the C# version you target, even when you upgrade to point fixes. You'll also understand the mapping of these features to the ongoing work on the standard and new versions of the standard."
