description: 'This is a session for application developers who want to learn about the productivity benefits of developing applications with Platform as a Service (PaaS), and get started deploying and scaling apps to the cloud. In this free 30-minute webinar, Andy Piper, Developer Advocate, of the Cloud Foundry Team, will explain what PaaS is and how it makes it easier for developers to build, deploy, run and scale applications. Furthermore, choosing an open source PaaS gives developers the most flexibility in choice of clouds, services and frameworks. We will demonstrate how to deploy and scale a simple application to Cloud Foundry using multiple application services. Then, we''ll show you how to deploy a complex application on your laptop using Micro Cloud Foundry and scale to CloudFoundry.com without changing a single line of code. Don''t miss the chance to learn about how PaaS can accelerate your app''s time to market. Follow Andy and send Andy any of your PaaS or Cloud Foundry questions via Twitter--@andypiper.'
