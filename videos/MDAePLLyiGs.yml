description: "Remember when setting up an auth system was easy? Me neither. From the signup form, the login form, password reset form, and all the validation in between it can easily take weeks if not months to get something basic up and running. Then you have to deal with all the security considerations. No thanks. During this presentation, the attendees will be introduced to OpenID and OAuth. They will learn how to leverage these technologies to create secure applications, but most importantly, they will learn why and how to delegate authorization and authentication so they can focus on their real work and forget about all that security stuff.\n\n# About the Presenter\n\nJoel Lord is passionate about web and technology in general. He likes to learn new things but most of all, he likes to share his discoveries. He does so by traveling at various conferences all across the globe.\n\nHe graduated from college in computer programming in the last millennium. Apart for a little break to get his BSc in computational astrophysics, he was always in the industry.\n\nAs a technical evangelist with Auth0, he meets with developers to help them make the web a safer place.\n\nDuring his free time, he is usually found stargazing in a camping site somewhere or brewing a fresh batch of beer in his garage."
