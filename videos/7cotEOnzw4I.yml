description: "We hear from James Birnie at SC London 2019. James' talk, \"What does GREAT Architecture Look like?\" is about James' views on architecture and architects and how they add, or in this case, withdraw value from the business. James' presentation focuses on anti-patterns, how to identify them, and how to understand what a good architectural decision is. \n\nFor more information on SC London or to find out how you can participate, please visit https://sc-london.com/.\n\nRelated Content:\nWhat does GREAT Architecture Look like? https://youtu.be/LJIfHmYQ6Zs"
