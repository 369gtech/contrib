description: "by Phil Cluff\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/H.1309/media_libre.webm\n\n\nStreaming video on the internet in 2019 is littered with a cacophony of proprietary, patent encumbered technologies. As the landscape of the internet evolves libre video technologies are becoming more prominent in browsers and on devices, but we’re still a long way from a complete solution. \n\nIn this session we’ll walk through the state of libre video on the internet and pick technologies to reach as many users and devices as possible while suggesting workarounds for the problems we find. We’ll also explore how we can leverage adaptive bitrate technologies within a libre video technology stack to provide a seamless user experience. \n\nFinally we’ll also take a forward facing look at the future of online video and how AV1 can help bring libre video to the masses. \n\nRoom: H.1309 (Van Rijn)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 16:00:00+01"
