On the field, customers are getting a fresh system every 6 weeks. This would not be possible without a robust Continuous Integration System vetting check-ins from our 200+ developers. In this talk, we describe the overall architecture with specific emphasis on our test automation lab. In addition, we discuss Moblab (short for mobile (test) lab), our entire test automation infrastructure running from one chromebox. This system is used by many of our partners so that they too can run tests the way we do."
