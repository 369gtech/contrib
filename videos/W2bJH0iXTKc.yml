description: "Many data science and machine learning techniques require labelled data. In many businesses, this means that a lot of time, energy or money goes into acquiring labels. Active learning is a technique to make this process more efficient, by choosing data points to label based on current model performance. Here, I discuss methods of doing so easily and quickly in the interactive python ecosystem.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
