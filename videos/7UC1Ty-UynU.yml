The training course helped me in all areas that I was previously unclear about, especially concepts like Machine learning and Mahout. The training was very informative and practical. LMS pre recorded sessions and assignmemts were very good as there is a lot of information in them that will help me in my job. The trainer was able to explain difficult to understand subjects in simple terms. Edureka is my teaching GURU now...Thanks EDUREKA and all the best. \""
