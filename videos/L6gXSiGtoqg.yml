description: "Public REST APIs have become mainstream. Now almost every company that wants to expose services or an application programming interface does it by using a publicly exposed REST API. This presentation gives attendees the skills they need in for identifying and understanding REST vulnerabilities. The findings are a result of reviewing production REST applications as well as researching popular REST frameworks.\n\n\nAuthor:\nAbraham Kang\nAbraham Kang is fascinated with the nuanced details associated with programming languages and their associated APIs. Kang has a B.S. from Cornell University. He recently joined Samsung as a Director of Software helping to drive security across new products and services in development. Prior to joining Samsung, he worked as Principal Security Researcher for HP Fortify in their Software Security Research group.
