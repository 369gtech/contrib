The focus of the conference has been mostly as to the mechanics --- what to create, how to create it, what new forms of content will be made, how will people use the new content, new experiments in content types, etc.\n\nWe would like to explore the next phase... now that you've made something amazingly cool, how do you get it out there? What opportunities exist for you to sell your wares and new content types?\n\nSol Rosenberg\n\nCopia Interactive, LLC\n\nMr. Rosenberg is Vice President of Business Development and Content Acquisition for Copia Interactive -- the first social e-reading platform.\n\nAt the forefront of ebooks and digital content for more than a decade, Sol Rosenberg is a leading expert in the world of ebooks, digital publishing & marketing strategies.\n\nHe was a co-founder of the ebook pioneer Versaware and has helped major publishers with their digital initiatives -- companies like McGraw-Hill, Cengage, Taylor & Francis, Simon & Schuster, Jones & Bartlett, Encyclopedia Britannica and many others.\n\nThis blending of communications and high-technology began when Sol created the first nationally-syndicated computer-focused radio show.
