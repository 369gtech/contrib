recordingDate: 1519313109
description: "AWS Lambda has changed how developers build and run their applications or services. But what are the best practices for tasks such as deployment, monitoring, and debugging in a serverless world? In this session, we値l dive into best practices that serverless developers can use for application lifecycle management, CI/CD, monitoring, and diagnostics. We値l talk about how you can build CI/CD pipelines that automatically build, test, and deploy your serverless applications using AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeBuild, and AWS CloudFormation. We値l also cover the built-in capabilities of Lambda and API Gateway for creating multiple versions, stages, and environments of your functions and environments of your functions and APIs. Finally, we値l cover monitoring and diagnostics of your Lambda functions.\n\nArun Gupta, Amazon Web Services\nArun Gupta is a Principal Open Source Technologist at Amazon Web Services.
