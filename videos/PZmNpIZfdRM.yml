description: 'We had a fantastic start to our ‘Code the Road’ Europe tour at the Google Tel Aviv Campus.  We were thrilled to have so many enthusiastic developers to help kick off our first event.  It was great to be in Tel Aviv to feel the excitement and energy of their thriving startup community and to see how these talented developers were using location and Google Maps APIs in their applications.'
