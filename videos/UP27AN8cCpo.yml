recordingDate: 1634115626
description: "You did great job finishing this web app on time and budget. Design patterns, good code coverage, cutting edge frameworks and best CI ever. It goes to production and boom, clients complain it's too slow. They don't really care, if it's best engineering ever, if each view loads 2 seconds. My presentation will give you hints on how to look for bottlenecks. I will also share simple tricks to make the app work faster, or at least seem to work faster.\n#Performance\n\nPresented by Ola Kunysz\n\nSubscribe to our channel: https://youtube.pl/c/DevoxxPoland?sub_confirmation=1\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DevoxxPL\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/grzegorz.duda.official/\n\nJoin us also here:\nTechnology Radar Review: https://dworld.pl/radar\nDevelopers World Academy: https://dworld.pl/akademia\nDevflix: https://devflix.pl\n\n#Devoxx #DevoxxPoland #IT #Development #SoftwareDevelopment"
