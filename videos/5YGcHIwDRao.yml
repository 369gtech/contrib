title: 'YOW! 2016 Stuart Sierra - Building Flexible Systems with Clojure and Datomic'
recordingDate: 1492494947
description: "Business applications are demanding ever-greater flexibility, yet responding to evolving requirements is still a challenge for software developers. Programming languages and frameworks are often brittle and inflexible, prone to unpredictable second-order effects which make change not merely difficult but often risky. Can we do better? This talk will explore techniques for designing software systems to be both robust and adaptable.\n\nFor examples of patterns which enable flexibility, this talk will focus on Clojure, a dynamically-typed functional language; Datomic, a transactional, distributed database; and clojure.spec, a dynamic testing and validation library.\n\nStuart Sierra has been involved in Clojure since (almost) the very beginning and is the author of many open-source Clojure libraries. He developed one of the first real-world Clojure web applications, AltLaw. He is the co-author, with Luke VanderHart, of the book ClojureScript: Up and Running and Practical Clojure.\n\nHe is also a musician, writer, actor and New Yorker.\n\nFor more on YOW!
