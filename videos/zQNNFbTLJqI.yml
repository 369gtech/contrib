description: "What is the future of Google Glass and other wearable technologies? There isn't a specific answer, but this is the question that Maximiliano Firtman addresses in this talk from Dreamforce 2013. He explains how Google Glass works, comments on user experience, and includes plenty of demos.\n\nThis talk is not exclusively about Google Glass, but about developing for wearable technologies in general. The concepts discussed will help you to start thinking about this new paradigm from a high level. He explains that the technology is there, but whether wearable technologies will catch on is up to society.\n\nMax is a prolific web + mobile app developer, author, and consultant, with nearly 20 years of experience. He also teaches classes at NewCircle.\n\nFollow along with Max's slides: http://crcl.to/qi404\n\nMore HTML5 resources: http://crcl.to/puh67\nProfessional HTML5 training: http://crcl.to/98x6f"
