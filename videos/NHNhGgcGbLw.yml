description: "Edgility - 5G Orchestration in Serverless-Edge Cloud-Native Environments - Eden Pierre Rozin, AT&T \n\nEdge computing is becoming the major component in 5G networks. While edge computing provides an u-low-latency solution, it brings with it other challenges. On one hand, edge clouds are small, and their computing resources are scarce. On the other hand, they are required to serve many applications, such as the 5G edge ecosystem, live video streaming and IoT. The edge gives the opportunity for vendors to deploy their own software. However, this needs to be done in an agile manner. With the proliferation of IoT devices and Autonomous cars of different brands, the industry cannot afford countless years and M$ integration projects. In this session, we will show how we meet these challenges using ONAP, Cloudify, Akraino and other open source projects. We will show a real use case of the full ML-driven life cycle management of applications running on an edge cloud using serverless technology. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPea"
