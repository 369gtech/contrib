recordingDate: 1558058285
description: "The world we live in requires us to acquire new skills and absorb new knowledge in order to stay afloat. We must learn to SHIFT as things around us are changing. We see this on an individual, team, and organizational levels. We feel the pushback when we try to implement new technology or when we are making an Agile transformation. However, we are leaving out one crucial piece of the puzzle: we are forgetting to forget, or rather, UNLEARN. Even though old habits are hard to break, the more we can unlearn the more likely we are to experience a sense of growth.\r\n\r\nIn this interactive talk, Jessie will share learnings and unlearnings from her own career, stories from some of the companies she has worked with, and techniques she teaches in order to make breakthroughs and forge ahead. - Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/channel/craftconf with the Ustream Mobile App"
