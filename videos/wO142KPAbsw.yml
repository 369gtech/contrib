description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2012\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nDirk Duellmann - Storage and Persistency Specialist at CERN\n\nABSTRACT\nThe Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the flagship project of the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). Last year some 20 PB of data have been delivered to the high-energy physics community and have been analyzed by more than 8000 users worldwide. This presentation describes the particular requirements and boundary conditions for LHC data and storage management and the infrastructure in place at CERN and many partner sites. It will also cover the main lessons learned during several years of development and deployment of the current distributed data handling system.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
