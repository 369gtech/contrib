description: 'The Android platform makes it easy to get started, hard to get it right. This workshop will move you along that spectrum, explaining essential concepts and components of Android. You''ll learn about lifecycles of processes, applications, activities, and fragments; the four components of Android apps and how they communicate; and options for local data storage. Two hours of explanation can save dozens of hours in the documentation: skip some of the work and get to the fun part of building a useful app for your Android device.'
