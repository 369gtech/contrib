title: 'Developers Are Users, Too'
language: English
recordingDate: 1601027986
description: "As more companies begin to embrace design, we’re starting to see an increased focus on developer experience (DX). APIs and other developer tools are the products of the modern technology organization. It’s time we start to think about how we improve these tools by making them more developer-friendly, even without designers on the team.\n\nIn this session, I’ll give examples of how the VMware Tanzu Spring Cloud Services team leverages design to create better products for our customers. These examples will illustrate how any agile development team can apply these easy-to-use design methods to generate, evaluate, and act on key user insights. \n\nImproving DX can help increase productivity (and happiness!) by allowing developers to focus on what they do best: build software. It’s time to take a step back and think of developers as users, too.\n\nErick Arias, Senior Product Designer at VMware\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/developers-are-users-too"
