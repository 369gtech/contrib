title: 'YOW! 2016 Caitie McCaffrey & Christopher Meiklejohn - A Brief History of Distributed Programming'
recordingDate: 1494825461
description: "While many of the distributed systems we operate today are built with language like Java and Go, distributed programming has a long history of innovation and adoption of its ideas. This include innovations seen all throughout the various fields of computing: novel type systems for dynamic languages; the concept of the promise, now a standard programming technique in web development; and unified models of programming when data lives across nodes. Some of these ideas had major impact, while some fell incredibly short. Many technically superior ideas were not adopted simply because they were too “research” focused.\n\nDuring this talk, we will present the history of RPC and current uses in industry like Finagle and gRPC, and why RPC may not be the best abstraction for building your next distributed application.\n\nCaitie McCaffrey is a Backend Brat and Distributed Systems Diva at Twitter. Prior to that, she spent the majority of her career building large-scale services and systems that power the entertainment industry at 343 Industries, Microsoft Game Studios, and HBO. Caitie has a degree in Computer Science from Cornell University, and has worked on several video games including Gears of War 2, Gears of War 3, Halo 4, and Halo 5 She maintains a blog at CaitieM.com and frequently discusses technology on Twitter @Caitie\n\nChristopher Meiklejohn loves distributed systems and programming languages. Previously, Christopher worked at Basho Technologies, Inc. on the distributed key-value store, Riak. Christopher develops a programming language for distributed computation, called Lasp. Christopher is currently a Ph.D. student at the Université Catholique de Louvain in Belgium.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
