Come hear the story from the SQL Server engineering team.\n\nWe'd love to tell the story on how we made SQL Server available to ecosystems outside of Windows in this talk. It's a great story that involves quite a bit of interesting technologies and we'd like to share that with everyone!\n\nArgenis Fernandez Brian Gianforcaro Eugene Birukov\n\nhttps://cfp.all-systems-go.io/ASG2019/talk/GTYJFV/"
