description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2012.\nSpeaker: Paco Nathan\nIntroduction to Cascading, an application framework for Java developers to deploy robust, enterprise-grade applications on Apache Hadoop. We'll start with the simplest Cascading program possible (file copy in a distributed file system) and progress in small steps to show a Java-based social recommender system based on Twitter feeds.\n\nIntroduction to Cascading, an application framework for Java developers to deploy robust, enterprise-grade applications on Apache Hadoop. We'll start with the simplest Cascading program possible (file copy in a distributed file system) and progress in small steps to show a Java-based social recommender system based on Twitter feeds.\n\nThe objective is to show how to work with \"Big Data\", starting on a laptop with sample data sets, to generate JAR-based apps which can be deployed on very large clusters.\n\nWe'll show best practices for scalable apps in Cascading, how to leverage TDD features, etc."
