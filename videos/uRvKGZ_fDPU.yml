description: "Keynote: From COBOL to Kubernetes: A 250 Year Old Bank's Cloud-Native Journey - Laura Rehorst, Product Owner - Stratus Platform, ABN AMRO Bank NV & Mike Ryan, DevOps Consultant, backtothelab.io \n\nAdopting Kubernetes in an enterprise setting is challenging enough. Doing so in the highly-regulated banking industry presents further challenges. In this presentation Laura Rehorst (Product Owner - Stratus Platform, ABN AMRO) and Mike Ryan (DevOps Consultant) will share some of the lessons learned during ABN AMRO's Kubernetes adoption, discuss how Kubernetes accelerated the bank's Digital Transformation, and demonstrate parts of our Continuous Compliance infrastructure.\n\nThe technical part of the presentation will include demonstrations of how Open Policy Agent is used in CICD pipelines and Admission Controllers, our process for automatically repaving infrastructure to protect against Advanced Persistent Threats, and how our \"\"compliant by default\"\" approach allows us to move fast (without breaking things). \n\nhttps://sched.co/MRzj"
