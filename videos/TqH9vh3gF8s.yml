title: 'Learning to program or speak a foreign language? - Anita Mongia'

description: "Having been able to learn 6 languages, I was baffled by my inability to learn how to code. Seeing as C++ was a compulsory course as part of my Bachelor of Science, I was forced to at least pretend to learn it. This was the first time I ever experienced not being able to learn something by simply studying it. I just didn’t get it. I started wondering; was it me or was I just not wired for it? Or maybe I was just better off spending my time learning other languages, such as English and Spanish. Compiling a foreign language is so much easier and less hopeless.\nLanguages, in all shapes and forms, is crucial to the way we communicate, both on a societal and individual level. Even the absence of language can be a form of communication. Coding, as a form of language, is subtler in its areas of application, and therefore its importance can be harder to realize. So which one would I actually be better off learning?"
