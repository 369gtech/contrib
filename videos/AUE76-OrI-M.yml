description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nDiscussion & Comments: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2019\n—\nVisual Studio 2019 was released earlier this year, and it brings new experiences for C++ developers targeting any platform, not just Windows. Modeled based on our previously successful talks at CppCon, this year we'll give the community an update on how we're progressing towards C++20 conformance and we'll cover many of the new productivity features in the latest updates of Visual Studio 2019, including CMake integration, Linux targeting, MSVC compiler and debugger advancements and more. You will also have a sneak preview of the new features coming in later in 2019 that we have never shared before. You will learn new tricks that you can apply immediately upon leaving the session as well as get a sense of what is coming in the future. The main message is that Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code will make every C++ developer (not just Windows developers) more productive\n— \nMarian Luparu\nPrincipal Program Manager Lead, Microsoft\nAsk me about @Code @VisualStudio and #Vcpkg\n\n\nSimon Brand\nMicrosoft\nC++ Developer Advocate\nEdinburgh, Scotland\n\nSimon is Microsoft’s C++ Developer Advocate. Their background is in compilers and debuggers for embedded accelerators, but they’re also interested in generic library design, metaprogramming, functional-style C++, undefined behaviour, and making our communities more welcoming and inclusive.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
