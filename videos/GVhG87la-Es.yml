description: "What Does it Mean to Lead IT?\n\nMark Schwartz, author of \"A Seat at the Table\"\n\nIn an era of autonomous teams working directly with business users and product owners, what is the role of IT Leadership? We talk a lot about the role of CIOs in leading the transformation to DevOps and to digital services, but what then? What does an IT Leader do once an organization has embraced DevOps? And what does it mean to be an Agile CIO?\n\nFor Mark Schwartz, this is a pressing issue. As a CIO leading a DevOps transformation in the most challenging of environments, he is facing an existential question. As he puts it: “um, what do I do now?” The literature on IT leadership does not concern itself with today’s advances in Agility and DevOps, and the Agile and DevOps worlds do not seem to talk much about what they expect IT leaders to be doing.\n\nAn Agile CIO must do more than oversee Agile projects. In this session, Mr. Schwartz will bring the principles of Agility to bear on the practice of IT Leadership, and show just how deep a change is required in how we think about not just the craft of the IT leader, but the very basis of how IT fits into the enterprise. His conclusions are surprising and provocative.\n\nDOES17 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
