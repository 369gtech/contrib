description: "Anzen. It helped a 100-year-old, 60,000-person aluminum manufacturer regain its greatness, and it powers software that millions of people love. Study every lean/agile practice, and you’ll find it’s a common denominator. Anzen means safety in Japanese. When anzen lives within software, it just works; people regularly use and recommend it; engineers modify it without fear; it contains few defects; it can be deployed with ease; it is immune from threats; and it helps protect the organization’s finances, reputation, and investors. Anzen lies at the heart of excellence. This session shares what anzen is, how it promotes safe risk-taking, how to identify faux safety, challenges of growing an anzen culture, and what it means to be an anzeneer.\n\n\nAuthor:\nJoshua Kerievsky\nJoshua is a globally recognized thought leader in Agile and Lean software development.
