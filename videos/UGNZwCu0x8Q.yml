description: "Some JavaScript professionals do not know CSS as well as they’d like to. In order to help them, PPK decided to write a book “CDD for JavaScripters”, where he will explain CSS in terms that JavaScripters will understand. \n\nBut what are those terms? What kind of teaching would JavaScripters expect? Is there a CSS mental model that is different from a JavaScript mental model? Is CSS a programming language? Does that matter for teaching or learning CSS? \n\nPPK will give a brief outline of where he’s standing right now on these questions. The majority of the session will be used for a discussion with the audience. How should he teach CSS? Why is it so hard for some to understand it? What are the least-understood parts of CSS? We hope this discussion will yield valuable feedback.\n\nEVENT:\n\nAmsterdam JS 2019\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nPeter-Paul Koch\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nConference Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nAdditional material for CSS learners:\n\nhttps://amzn.to/2Ffp1ll   CSS in Depth\n\nhttps://amzn.to/2FlKV6N CSS Secrets: Better Solutions to Everyday Web Design Problems\n\nhttps://amzn.to/2Tk6kBZ  CSS: The Definitive Guide: Visual Presentation for the Web\nhttps://amzn.to/2FgQcMI  A Smarter Way to Learn HTML & CSS: Learn it faster.
