title: 'Cloud Foundry Networking: Enabling Direct Communication for Microservices - Chin, McClure'
language: English
recordingDate: 1513268980
description: "Have you ever wondered how your microservices communicate with one another on Cloud Foundry? Until recently, all traffic between applications had to go through the Cloud Foundry router. Now, with the addition of the new CF-Networking stack, users can create policies that allow applications to directly communicate with one another, enhancing application security and performance.\n\nIn this talk, we will give an overview of the networking features in Cloud Foundry and highlight some of the challenges we faced while designing and developing CF-Networking. We will also showcase how CF-Networking integrates with service registries like Eureka and Spring Cloud Services through a live demonstration where we deploy microservices that can discover and communicate directly with each other.\n\nSlides: TBA\n \nAngela Chin, Software Engineer, Pivotal\nDavid McClure, Software Engineer, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2017"
