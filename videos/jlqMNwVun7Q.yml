title: 'The Death and Rebirth of Docs.rs - Quiet Misdreavus'
language: English
recordingDate: 1578505273
description: 'Docs.rs is a beloved resource in the Rust community, but it was not long ago that such a resource did not exist. Join QuietMisdreavus as she tells the story of docs.rs, from its humble beginnings as crates.fyi and a Rustacean''s learning project; through to its heyday and decline as a single-maintainer project that became a trusted community resource; to its rebirth in the present day as an official Rust Project-maintained endeavor. Along the way, you can also get an insider''s view into the service and take a peek at how it ticks.'
