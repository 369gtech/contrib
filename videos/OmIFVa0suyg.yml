description: "Toward Loosely Coupled Orchestration for the LEO Satellite Edge\n\nVaibhav Bhosale, Ketan Bhardwaj, and Ada Gavrilovska, Georgia Institute of Technology\n\nLow Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites are envisioned to be capable of providing Internet services for billions of users who currently lack reliable Internet connectivity. This calls for a new LEO edge capable of providing edge computing benefits from space. This paper proposes an orchestration approach for the LEO edge that incorporates path models, temporal compensation and affinity chains as the primary scheduling constructs, and presents preliminary results that illustrate opportunities for achieving improved service availability and improved performance for a stateful (caching) edge function.\n\nView the full HotEdge '20 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/hotedge20/workshop-program"
