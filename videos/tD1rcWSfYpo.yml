description: "Video with transcript included: https://bit.ly/2Le6VXM             \n\nLuca Mezzalira explains how to implement micro-frontends, enabling to scale up a project with tens of developers without reducing the throughput. Micro-frontends are a new architectural trend in the development of front-end applications. This style can provide several benefits to our projects, offering a level of decoupling never seen before in single-page applications or universal architectures.\n\nThis presentation was recorded at QCon London 2020: http://bit.ly/2VfRldq \n\n#MicroFrontends #Performance #Scalability"
