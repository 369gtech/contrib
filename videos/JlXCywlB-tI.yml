description: 'For years I have been used to putting out fires after code changes and having parts of the product that can never be touched. The uncertainty and fear wore me down. Getting to know TDD, Clean Code and other methodologies was the start of a process of gaining confidence and a good night’s sleep. Making the transition wasn’t always easy. This is the story of what it took for me to let go of my old habits, teach myself new tricks and transition into code craftsmanship.'
