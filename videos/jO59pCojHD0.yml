description: "Talk recording from Amsterdam JSNation 2018 Conference https://amsterdamjs.com\n\n# Accelerating Ethereum Development with Node.js and Docker\n\nAt oneUp.company we build a lot of MVPs based on Ethereum smart contracts and Vue. To accelerate this process, we have been using Node.js and Docker to automate the manual steps. The boilerplate code for this is now made available on Github, making the creation of Ethereum dApps smoother for everyone. During this presentation we present this boilerplate code and give pointers on how to best use Node.js and Docker for Ethereum smart contracts."
