description: "Web development in Haskell is efficient, contorting, rewarding, frustrating and elegant all at the same time. 12 Months building production quality Haskell has taught many lessons, and in this talk we will discuss the amazing, with the downright painful, and hope to provide a glimpse at what it is like building real software in a purely functional world.\n\nWe will look at the Haskell eco-system and tools; Yesod and the other technologies used to build ApiEngine; as well as the social side of Haskell development by looking at what it takes to spin up new developers.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference and YOW! Lambda Jam, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au and http://www.lambdajam.com.au"
