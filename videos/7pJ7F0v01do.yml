description: "LISA16 - Panel: Sysadmins Ask the Managers\n\nModerator: Andy Seely, Science Applications International Corporation\nPanelists: Carolyn Rowland, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST); Cory Lueninghoener, Los Alamos National Laboratory; Mike Rembetsy, Bloomberg; Scott Cromar, Convergys; Connie-Lynne Villani, Grilled Cheese Invitational\n\nSysadmins Ask the Managers is a guided question and answer panel with technical managers from different industries and at different managerial levels. Part \"Dilbert,\" part \"One FTE,\" and part \"XKCD,\" the panel will offer management vision and explore management topics as they relate to every sysadminâ€™s life. Come to ask the hard questions you always wished you could, and hear managers talk about how they define success, what they see as their challenges, what they expect out of employees, and how they can help you. Take away real insight into the relationship between sysadmins and managers that will lead to stronger relationships, reduced friction, and more effective teams.\n\nThe managers panel will consist of four to five people from different industries and levels of management, where all have at least direct supervisory responsibility. The goal will be a range of junior to senior managers.\n\nView the full LISA16 Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa16/conference-program"
