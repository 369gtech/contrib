description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM SF 2020 - http://bit.ly/2wpn0SM\n\nGet involved in Code Sync's next conference - http://bit.ly/2Mcm4aS\n\n---\n\nCODING FOR GLOBAL LANGUAGES: UNICODE, CHARSETS, STRINGS AND BINARIES\nby Marc Sugiyama\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nCharacter sets\nCharacter encoding\nClarity\n\nABSTRACT\nWriting global software means our programs need to speak global human languages, but writing programs that work correctly with non-Western European languages is at best a confusing affair. UTF8, latin1, Unicode?\n\nWhat do these terms mean and how are they related to one another?\nAnd what does Erlang do?\n\nThis talk demystifies the terminology around character encoding, explains how to retrofit your Erlang program for Unicode using Datometry HyperQ as a case study, and gives some best practices to help you break the one-byte/one-character assumption.\nSlides & full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/marc-sugiyama/\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - MARC SUGIYAMA\n\nMarc Sugiyama is a software engineer at Datometry where he works on HyperQ an Adaptive Data Virtualization(TM) technology that enables enterprises to run their existing applications on modern cloud data warehouses, without rewriting or reconfiguring them. Prior to joining Datometry, Marc was a senior architect at Erlang Solutions, Inc., where his projects included developing an OpenFlow controller and sample applications for the IvanOS project, design and code reviews, and providing training at conferences and for clients. A Bay Area native, Marc has more than 30 years of software development experience and has worked on everything from testing frameworks at Sybase and Cisco to SMP relational database engines at Sybase, an MMO engine for Pixverse (a company he co-founded), and a large-scale real-time chat system for hi5 Networks. A published author, Marc wrote his first magazine articles and books while still in high school. Marc holds a BS in engineering and a masters of engineering from Harvey Mudd College. He currently serves on the College Preparatory School Advisory Council and the board of directors of the Heart Mountain Wyoming Foundation.\nMore on Marc Nijdam: https://codesync.global/speaker/marc-sugiyama/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM SF 2020\nCode BEAM SF is powered by Code Sync.
