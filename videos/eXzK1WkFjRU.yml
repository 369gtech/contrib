title: 'Low power cellular for the IoT - Peder Rand'
recordingDate: 1536137605
description: "LTE-M and NB-IoT enables low complexity and low power end-nodes that stay continuously connected to the internet through the ubiquitous LTE/4G cellular network. Mobile trackers and static sensors can be deployed with a battery that will last a decade and provide data to the cloud from anywhere without deploying a new infrastructure of gateways.\nTopics to cover:\n- LTE technology basics\n- Low power end-node hardware block diagram\n- Compatible and not so compatible transport protocols\n- Security for an internet connected device – implemented with the restriction of battery operation and modest compute power\n- The importance of edge computing in a cellular network – and how it affects cloud AI’s access to data sets"
