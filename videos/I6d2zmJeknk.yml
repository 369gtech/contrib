description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2014.\nSpeakers: Pete Buchop and Anne Fyk, STA Group\nApplied Spring Track\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/prototyping-mobileapplicationswithspring-2014\nA common challenge in mobile prototyping is creating an environment where both server side data services and client side applications integrate easily. The back end services need to be Internet accessible for communication to the mobile device. For easier integration with the client side mobile application, the services should be restful. To speed the prototyping process, it is important that services can be developed quickly, and changed easily, since they are typically standing in for real services during this phase. We wanted to see if these objectives could be met using the Spring Framework. For this evaluation we used Spring Boot, to allow easy creation of a server side Spring application, along with Spring Rest to meet the server side objectives and create the necessary services. Spring Android and iOS are used on the mobile client side to prototype a dashboard application that uses these services. In this session, we will demonstrate our results and lessons learned from creating a mobile prototyping ecosystem using Spring Boot, Spring Rest, Spring Android and iOS. Sample code will be provided."
