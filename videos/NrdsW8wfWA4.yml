title: 'Andrey Dyatlov. What’s up with C# 9'
language: English
recordingDate: 1619617936
description: "The new version of the language delivers a bunch of new features. Some of them are probably already familiar to you: source code generators, pattern-matching improvements, records, context-defined new() — while others are probably less known, like changes for nullable reference types and context-defined types in conditional expressions. Perhaps only those of you who do low-level optimisation and work with unsafe code may have heard about skipping the init of local variables, native integer types, and function pointers.There are also a few mysterious features that may be included into C#9 or pushed to the next version of the language. These are new null-checking syntax for parameters and method return type covariance.\n\nIt is time to figure out scenarios where which of those features truly open new capabilities of the language instead of being some mere syntactic sugar.\n\nI will present a few cases showing what to expect from C#9.\n\nPresentation: https://disk.yandex.ru/i/aXy4Wjs6ywk_yA\n\nDotFest: https://2020.dotfest.ru/lecture/9"
