description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nChanging the SPIFFE ID of Every SPIRE-Enabled Workload at Uber - Challenges and Learnings - Prasad Borole, Uber\n\nThis is a story of migration of SPIFFE IDs of workloads deployed across thousands of nodes in Uber. As our identity platform and core constructs in the underlying infrastructure model evolved over time, we had to undertake an initiative to change the format of SPIFFE IDs for varying classes of consumers. In order to roll out a new SPIFFE ID convention across our microservices deployment, we had to understand the landscape of service-to-service authorization mechanisms in use at Uber in order to update all authorization policies referencing SPIFFE IDs. We also had to plan for the potential effects that creating many new registrations could have on the reliability of the SPIRE control plane. There were few challenges we encountered along the way like hard-coded SPIFFE IDs, lack of ways to choose preferred identity from multiple identities etc. Listeners could benefit from this presentation by knowing more about the SPIFFE ID format and selectors we have chosen from learnings and problems we faced during migration and avoid one in future."
