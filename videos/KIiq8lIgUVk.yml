title: 'Building Data Intensive Microservices with Apache Kafka - ?Yaniv Rodenski'

description: "We all know Microservices come in all shapes and sizes. This include performing a range of tasks from handling user interaction, all the way to do the heavy lifting for complex compute operations, exposing different APIs, such as HTTP based web services, RPC technologies such as Avro or using queuing technologies such as RabbitMQ. While Microservices are also scalable on their own merits, but what if the volume of data is just too big?\n\nApache Kafka is a highly scalable messaging system that was built to handle the internal messaging of one of the largest websites in the world, and support Big Data workloads in addition to its pub-sub capabilities.\n\nIn this talk we will see how Kafka and its surrounding eco-system can fuel Microservices that need to scale to handle large amounts of data."
