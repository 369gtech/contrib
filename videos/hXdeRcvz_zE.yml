description: "They Don't Teach You That In School\n\nhttp://strataconf.com/stratany2012/public/schedule/detail/26299\n\nA fireside chat with Cathy O'Neil about why universities can't make data scientists.

Some universities are adding data science graduate departments, but they're facing an uphill battle, thanks to a lack of good data for academics, political infighting, and scalability issues."
