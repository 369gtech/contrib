description: "Google Tech Talks\nFebruary 1, 2007\n\nABSTRACT\n\nHumans are dynamic and adaptive. If our buildings are to be truly human-centered then they must be sensitive to our changing needs. Sensor networks enable that reality in an economical and scalable way that balances the social need for efficiency and productivity with the human need for privacy. This talk will provide an overview of the major effort underway at MERL to explore this possible future. We have collected almost a year of data from our facility using over 200 wireless motion sensors. The wireless sensors were created at MERL, and their design was shaped by years of experience with the preceding sensor systems. The data we have collected has..."
