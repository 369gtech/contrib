language: English
recordingDate: 1617275387
description: "Completing web forms is a pain, we all know it. At CompareTheMarket we have been exploring ways of sourcing users’ information from third-parties and then pre-filling form fields for them. We tested this on both our Home Insurance and Energy Switching web journeys and received strikingly different reactions. In this talk I’ll talk through what we did, what we found and the reasons why, as well as how we responded.\n\nAbout Speaker:\nPaul Izod – UX/UI Designer across all comparethemarket.com products, bringing a user-centered design approach to all projects.\n\nAbout TheUXConf:\nThe talk is part of the 6th edition of The UX Conference that took place in March 2021 – https://theuxconf.com"
