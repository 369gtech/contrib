description: "From writing and committing to publishing and promoting makesite.py, a static site generator for Python coders\n\nSunaina Pai\n\nMonday 17th, 16:30 (Assembly Room)\nA talk (25 minutes)\nThis session is about my personal journey of creating and publishing my first successful open source project in Python. I will share a story that starts with rewriting my static, shell-script-powered personal blog generator, then writing 120 lines of Python code, publishing it on Hacker News, and then trending on Hacker News and GitHub (right next to Linus Torvalds :-D) for a day of hacker-fame.\n\nIn this session, I will share how 120 lines of Python code written to solve a personal need helped me to connect with developers across the world and become a part of a small community of Python coders. I believe this session will be very useful to beginners who want to take their first step into creating their own personal Python project and make it successful.\n\nVisit https://github.com/sunainapai/makesite to see the source code of this project.\n\nThe speaker suggested this session is suitable for new programmers."
