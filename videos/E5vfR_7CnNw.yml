description: "Slides and more info: http://www.codemesh.io/codemesh2015/richard-warburton\n\nProfilers are a useful tool for developers trying to find out performance bottlenecks in their application. Unfortunately the results of profiling can mislead developers. Don't worry - we’re here to help! This talk explains what's really going on when you use a sampling profiler, enabling you to understand where your application is actually spending its time. This talk focusses on JVM profiling, but a lot of the approaches are related to operating system mechanics and apply to a variety of different languages. One of the benefits of languages like Scala and Clojure which run on the JVM is instant access to any of this tooling.\n\nWe shall look at:\n\n* What profiling APIs are available* Stack sampling profilers: stop motion view of your app\n\n * How they work\n\n* The official JVM stack sampling API.\n\n * An unofficial API that offers an alternative\n\n * A brave new open source profiler!\n\n\nAbout Richard\n\nRichard is an empirical technologist and solver of deep-dive technical problems. Recently he has written a book on Java 8 Lambdas for O’Reilly and is running java8training.com. He’s worked as a developer in many areas including Statistical Analytics, Static Analysis, Compilers and Network Protocols. He is a leader in the London Java Community and runs Openjdk Hackdays. Richard is also a known conference speaker, having talked at Devoxx, JavaOne, JFokus, Devoxx UK, Geecon, Oredev, JAX London and Codemotion. He has obtained a PhD in Computer Science from The University of Warwick."
