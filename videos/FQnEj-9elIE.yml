title: 'Fireside Chat #7: To specialise or not to specialise?'
language: English
recordingDate: 1626367768
description: "In this episode, our co-founders Sandro Mancuso and Mashooq Badar and Spain Managing Director José E. Rodríguez Huerta discuss if we should specialise or should not specialise. How about cross-functional teams vs cross-functional people? What is generalising specialists? What are the advantages and disadvantages of being a generalist or a specialist? What are the expectations we have from developers? Are they realistic? Are they even healthy? Is generalisation good for a developer's career? What about other roles—BAs, POs, PMs, UX, QAs, etc? \n\nIf you would like us to discuss a topic, please let us know in the comments and we will do our best to address it in a future episode. Any topics around Agile, Software Craftsmanship, Extreme Programming, technical practices, thought leadership, architecture, management, team dynamics, or anything else related to technology or software projects are welcome. \n\nThe idea of the Fireside chat series is to record many informal conversations we normally have outside working hours. Topics are normally decided just before we start recording. Our objective is to have spontaneous conversations instead of something more structured or scripted. \n\nFor more information about Codurance, please visit our website: https://codurance.com/."
