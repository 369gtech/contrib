title: 'Operational Service Views - Reactive Web Programming with Baratine by Sean Wiley'
language: English
recordingDate: 1492090529
description: "Asynchronous and non-blocking execution is a highly coveted attribute of high volume web services. Server side web services strive to make contractual agreements upon interface based APIs to other services, assuming their environments to be highly-available, recoverable, & loosely-coupled. However these attributes are often in direct disagreement with an APIs implementation given: (1) the underlying multi-threaded libraries an API must rely upon and (2) the outside data source whose assets must be operated upon before an API can complete.\n\nIn this talk I introduce Baratine, an asynchronous web framework with an improved thread and data execution model. By only accessing data for a particular service on a single thread, Baratine provides an authoritative owner of data services to be operated on continuously, solving both (1) & (2) sources of the aforementioned bottleneck.\n\nThese services can persist no state operating entirely in-memory, persist to Baratineâ€™s internal reactive document-style database or choose to persist to a traditional outside datasource. In this talk I will cover many use cases integrating Baratine with Java EE.\n\nSean Wiley is the Technical Evangelist and Senior Sales Engineer for Caucho Technology.
