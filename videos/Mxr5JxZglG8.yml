description: "At Amazee Labs, we pride ourselves in producing awesome websites and making clients happy. In\_the past, we achieved this by sitting down with the client at project kickoff and laying the roadmap for how the project build would go. We specified everything,\_in day long discovery workshops. Then we'd tackle design, and finally, we would build.\_\n\nClients were happy. Sites were pretty. But there was room for improvement.\n\nIn 2015, the Amazee Labs team saw an opportunity to improve our development process to better match internal and external needs. We adopted a Scrum-based Agile workflow which allowed us to work on multiple client projects at the same time without burning out our developers and still producing timely, quality code.\n\nSince implementing Scrum, we eliminated the bottleneck of a single technical lead, specifying everything at the beginning of a project, brought clients and developers together, and improved the accuracy of work estimations\n\nIn this session, I'll\_share our experience of adopting Scrum as an Agile development framework, what's worked, what's been hard, and what we've tweaked to work for us.\_\n\nYou will find out how we:\n\nKeep\_organized, focused, and motivated\_while working on multiple projects\_\nImproved team communication and morale\_\nHandle shifting workloads (and vacations!) in an agency environment without impacting delivery or team happiness\nInvolve the PO in the living\_build process\nBreak down work into Epics, Stories, Tasks (project managers, this is for you!)\nEstimate more accurately\_(and why this makes clients happy)\nRun effective retrospectives with a distributed team\_\nIf there's interest,\_we can schedule a BOF afterward so attendees can share their experiences of implementing Scrum in their own teams."
