description: "For a decade Jared worked on and then directed the official SXSW Interactive opening party.  As The Verge put it “… first it was just a chance for a few nerds to get drunk. Then it got so big, the fire department came and shut it down. Now it’s become a sort of high tech art fair meant to spark a conversation about the future of the digital world.”  The event grew to be thousands of people & became a large scale social experiment featuring several interactive installations yielding insights on the future.  Though that party has ended the experiments continue with MakerFaire.\n\nThis is the story behind the party, the formulas it ran on and the small things learned over the years building small and large installations. Jared will cover things he learned in executing the installations, but also little things like how signage strategy can help press coverage and exactly the distance a tent needs to be from a fence in order to keep a fully grown and supposedly responsible man who is probably a tech director at some big company from peeing back there.\n\nJared Ficklin\nChief Creative Technologist, argodesign\nhttps://twitter.com/jaredrawk\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
