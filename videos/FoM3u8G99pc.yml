description: "We’ve all experienced it: you’re working on a task, adding some code, and then you need to store some sensitive configuration value. It could be an API key, client secret or an encryption key ― something that’s highly sensitive and must be kept secret. And this is where things get messy. Usually, secret storage is highly coupled with how the code is deployed, and different platforms have different solutions.\n\nKubernetes has a promise to simplify this process by using the native secret object, which, as the name implies, can be used to store secrets or sensitive configurations. Unfortunately, Kubernetes secrets are fundamentally broken, and a developer who tries to use them will definitely have some issues.\n\nBut no need to worry ― there are solid alternatives for storing secrets securely on Kubernetes platform. One solution is to use Kamus, an open-source, git-ops solution, that created by Soluto, for managing secrets on Kubernetes. Kamus can encrypt a secret so it can be decrypted only by your app on runtime - and not by anyone else.\n\nThe first part of this session will cover the challenges faced when using Kubernetes secrets (from a usability and security point of view). The second part will discuss some of the existing solutions (Sealed Secrets, Helm Secrets and others), their pros, and cons, and then feature Kamus: how it works, what problems it solves, how it differs from other solutions, and what threats it can help mitigate (and what threats it can’t).\n\nThe talk will cover all that is required to know so you can run Kamus on your own cluster and use it for secret management.  Join me for this session to learn how you can build a Kubernetes cluster than can keep a secret ― for real.\n\nSpeakers\nOmer Levi Hevroni\nDevSecOps Engineer, Soluto\nI’ve been coding since 4th grade when my dad taught me BASIC and haven’t looked back since.
