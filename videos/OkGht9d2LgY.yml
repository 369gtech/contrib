Currently this happens only in movies and our imagination due to mainly scalability and fault tolerance limitations of robots.\n \nIn this talk Natalia introduces her vision of scaling complex robots and collections of robots using Erlang. She starts with an overview of existing robotics projects that use Erlang and then talks about her idea and some small research projects that she has conducted at Bournemouth and Glasgow Universities to develop the vision.\n\nRead the full abstract: http://bit.ly/2OVPg4k\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - NATALIA CHECHINA\nLecturer in computing at BOURNEMOUTH UNIVERSITY\n\nNatalia Chechina is passionate about distributed systems, cooperative robotics, scalability, fault tolerance, and as a result is in love with Erlang. Her research investigates approaches and techniques to enable scaling and efficient performance on commodity hardware where components are loosely coupled, communication is significant, and any of the components may fail or disconnect at any time.\n\nMore on Natalia Chechina: http://bit.ly/2OVPg4k\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE ELIXIR LDN 18\nCode BEAM Lite Berlin 18 was co-organised by Bitcrowd and Code Sync.\n\nBITCROWD\nWebsite: https://bitcrowd.net/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/bitcrowd\nMail: info at bitcrowd.net\n\nCODE SYNC \nWebsite: www.codesync.global\nTwitter: www.twitter.com/CodeElixirIO\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/CodeSyncGlobal\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/code-sync/\nMail: info at codesync.global\n\n#CBLBerlin #Elixir #CodeSync #Robots"
