description: "Check out the latest from The Lead Developer at theleaddeveloper.com.\n\nCode reviews are critiques of a person's work. If they are invested in that work, then that critique feels personal. We rarely acknowledge that we or our peers might be taking code review comments personally, but we should! We can leverage that understanding to make our code review process more effective, and foster better working relationships. This talk will draw on conflict resolution theory as well as personal experience to help you talk honestly with your collaborators about how code reviews make you feel."
