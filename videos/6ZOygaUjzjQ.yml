But why? \n\nThis talk will take a close look at the various rules that govern when an object is safe to access, including storage duration, object lifetime, initialization, and program termination. We'll look at some safe idioms for creating global singletons that are justified by these rules. And we'll look at the relevant, helpful features added in various revisions of C++, such as constexpr constructors, and how they make the situation better.\n— \nGreg Falcon\nStaff Software Engineer, Google\nGreg Falcon is a Staff Software Engineer at Google, working on the Abseil C++ library.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
