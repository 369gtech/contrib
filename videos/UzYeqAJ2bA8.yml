description: "DeepMind's AlphaGo Zero algorithm beat the best Go player in the world by training entirely by self-play. It played against itself repeatedly, getting better over time with no human gameplay input. AlphaGo Zero was a remarkable moment in AI history, a moment that will always be remembered. Move 37 in particular is worthy of many philosophical debates. You'll see what I mean and get a technical overview of its neural components (code + animations) in this video. Enjoy! \n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/Zeta36/chess-alpha-zero\n\nPlease Subscribe! And like. And comment. That's what keeps me going. \n\nWant more education?

At the top of the residual network, it says value layer twice. One should say 'policy' layer.\n2 The residual network is 40 layers, i say 20. \n\nThis video is apart of my Machine Learning Journey course:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/Machine_Learning_Journey\n\nMore Learning Resources:\nhttps://deepmind.com/blog/alphago-zero-learning-scratch/\nhttps://medium.com/applied-data-science/alphago-zero-explained-in-one-diagram-365f5abf67e0\nhttps://hackernoon.com/the-3-tricks-that-made-alphago-zero-work-f3d47b6686ef\nhttps://web.stanford.edu/~surag/posts/alphazero.html\nhttp://tim.hibal.org/blog/alpha-zero-how-and-why-it-works/\nhttp://www.jessicayung.com/alphago-zero-an-overview-of-the-algorithm/\n\nJoin us in the Wizards Slack channel:\nhttp://wizards.herokuapp.com/\n\nSign up for the next course at The School of AI:\nhttps://www.theschool.ai\n\nAnd please support me on Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/user?u=3191693\n\n#AlphaGoZero #Deepmind #SirajRaval"
