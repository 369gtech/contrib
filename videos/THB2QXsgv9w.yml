description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nSponsored Session: LogDNA - Planting Trees & Kubernetes Observability \n\n Deploying and debugging a service running on Kubernetes can be a disjoint experience requiring both in-depth Kubernetes knowledge and stitching together disparate tooling. In this demo, we'll be deploying a tree planting microservice onto Kubernetes to promote sustainable logging while working through the typical issues that arise from deploying to production. Leveraging LogDNA's Kube Enrichment, we will demonstrate how existing application logs are enhanced with Kubernetes information, ultimately enabling self-serve observability for microservice teams and giving a better end-to-end picture of your Kubernetes deployment. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ff0Q"
