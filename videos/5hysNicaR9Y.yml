description: "scikit-learn provides two popular ways to build tree ensembles: Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT) and Random Forests. In version 0.21, scikit-learn introduced its own Histogram-based GBDT inspired by LightGBM. In this talk, we will learn the underpinnings of GBDT and Random Forests, the differences between them, how each algorithm is optimized in scikit-learn, and how to interpret them.\n\nEVENT:\nPyData Austin 2019\n\nSPEAKER:\nThomas J Fan\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nPyData provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish PyData talks\n\nCREDITS:\nPyData YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOjD18EJYcsBog4IozkF_7w\n\nINTERESTED IN STOCK MARKET?\nI developed a successful stock market trading model: https://yuriymatso.com/my-market-model/"
