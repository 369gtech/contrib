description: "JavaFX Jumpstart\n\nJavaFX is cool, fresh and practicable – at least since Java 8. It comes with interesting features like FXML which is used to declare views, CSS for the styling of the UI and a Property API to model data-flows between architectural layers. With many other useful APIs like the Animation API, JavaFX became a state of the art UI-Toolkit which can be used to create desktop, mobile and even browser applications. This session gives you an idea about the benefits and how you can start exploring this useful Toolkit. Live coding included.\n\nJavaFX – Two for One\n\nThis session discusses two great topics in one slot.\n\nOn one hand the session will demonstrate how to run JavaFX applications in any browser, without the need of a plugin. This is possible due to the shown approach which leverages the structure of the JavaFX Scene Graph to map it to a HTML5 DOM right into the browser of the user.\n\nOn the other hand, the session will give you an overview of existing real world applications that are spread all over the world. It shows how JavaFX has been successfully deployed as part of many large and small business-critical applications in several domains.\n\nAlexander Casall graduated with a master’s degree in computer science in 2011. Since then he has worked at Saxonia Systems AG as a software engineer and become the head of the development team. He focuses on the implementation of modern multitouch applications with JavaFX. In his spare time, he enjoys developing native applications for iOS.\n\n[ADY-5626]"
