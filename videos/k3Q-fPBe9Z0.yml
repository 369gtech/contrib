description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nDiscussion & Comments: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2019\n—\nDo you dream of a good, ubiquitous \"package manager for C++\"?\nYou are not alone: It is one of the most requested feature by the community.\n\nBut despite the strong interest and the evident benefits this sought after unicorn would offer, existing solutions do not necessarily meet the community's expectations. Yet, other languages seem to have cracked this problem. What makes C++ more challenging?\n\nWe will try to define the scope of dependency management, talk about the C++ ecosystem and its tools. We will explore the advantages and drawbacks of the various ways to distribute and reuse C++ code and reflect on hot topics such as \"binary compatibility\", \"building the world\" and \"living at head\".\n\nWhile this talk will not spawn unicorns, we might discover a few actionable guidelines to make our projects easier to build and share.\n— \nCorentin Jabot\nCorentin Jabot is a member of the C++ committee and is mainly interested in portability and API design. He is working as a freelance developer in educational robotics.—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
