Git is the industry standard of code source control, helping manage and integrate changes easily. In this episode of Learn with Dr. G, Sarah will introduce you to the basics of Git, including what makes Git unique, getting started with a Git project, and making and tracking changes in Git. This is the first episode in our mini series, "What you didn''t learn in School"'
