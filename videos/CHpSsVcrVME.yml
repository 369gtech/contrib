description: "\"“When a biologist met Python”\n[EuroPython 2019 - Talk - 2019-07-11 - Singapore [PyData track]\n[Basel, CH]\n\nBy Maria Molina-Contreras\n\nBiology and computing are closer than we usually think, for example many algorithms are inspired in biology patterns, and complementary to that, researchers needs special algorithms to have a better understanding of our environment. Thus, there is a strong relation an dependency.\nIn the past years, Biology has been transformed into computational biology. Therefore\ntechnological advances helps us to predict physical interactions between atoms and DNA, because we are being able to integrate information from biology into algorithms.\n\nPython has become a popular programming language in biosciences because it has a clean syntax that makes it easy to read language. In addition to this, there are many modules (toolkits) extending to different biological domains, like metabolomics, structure analysis, phylogenomics, molecular biology and others. Python is currently improving researcher’s workflow, helping us to focus on the theory or experimental part, instead of fighting with old buggy applications. \n\nThis talk aims to be oriented to all audiences (with/without biological background) since we will go together through an amazing adventure into the natural sciences using tools like Biopython, Bokeh, Networkx, Ecopy and much more! Are you brave enough to follow me on this journey?\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2019.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/\n\n    \""
