description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2012\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nBrian Sletten - Forward-Leaning Software Consultant\n\nABSTRACT\nThe creative destruction caused by the emergence of the Web 20 years ago is still being felt. Profound changes to industries, education, our relationships, how we communicate, etc. have swept us up into entirely new ways of living our lives. What if this is only the beginning? What if we have only seen a portion of the potential of Tim Berners-Lee's original vision? What happens when we move away from just documents and web applications to webs of connected information? What if we are able to take the information with us from a web site and compare it to information in a database or another site? What does it mean for documents to be data sources?\nAll of these things are happening now. While people are arguing over web frameworks and language features, new technologies are coming online that will change the world. Again.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
