title: 'Math for Game Developers - Procedural Generation (White and Blue Noise)'
recordingDate: 1417121762
description: "We can scatter objects around our levels by using white noise. A refinement of white noise is blue noise, which ensures that the objects are scattered uniformly.\n\nThis blog post by Casey Muratori is a great complement to this video if you want to see more types of noise: http://mollyrocket.com/casey/stream_0014.html\n\nFind the source code here: https://github.com/BSVino/MathForGameDevelopers/tree/probability-bluenoise\n\nNew video every Thursday. Question? Leave a comment below, or ask me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/VinoBS\n\nEXERCISES:\n\n1. We hard-coded five cells. How much you change the code so that you can have an arbitrary number of cells?\n\n2. Suppose we want to scatter larger objects around our level. How might we adjust the cell sizes to ensure that the larger objects never touch?\n\n3. Tricky: With the radius and room size parameters radius we used in the code, how many cells can we have before the algorithm begins to break down?"
