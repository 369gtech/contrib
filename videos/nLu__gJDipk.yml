description: "Think of this talk as a Microservices 201. You know the basic of microservices and their pros and cons, but can you successfully maintain them in production? Microservices can make your code cleaner and more decoupled but they can be a pain to maintain in production: services writing logs in different places, requests that need to be tracked through multiple endpoints, circuit breakers going off… In this talk I’ll review these and other operational concerns and I’ll explain how making your microservices “observable” will help you maintain a healthy production environment without driving you crazy.\n\nMaria has worked with many different technologies and domains, which has helped her lead teams and advise stakeholders in making the right technology decisions. She has a real passion for coaching and for reducing the gender gap in the technology field.\n\n---\n\nWhen you’re busy leading a team, coding and maintaining standards, how do you find the time to stay ahead of new technologies and develop yourself as a technical lead?\n\nThe Lead Developer conference features practical advice from experts on leading and motivating your team and high-level sessions on new and disruptive technologies.\n\nGet tickets at theleaddeveloper.com"
