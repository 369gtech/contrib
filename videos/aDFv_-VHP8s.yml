title: 'A Year in Flink - Flink SQL Live Coding'
recordingDate: 1603903027
description: 'Flink''s SQL engine has evolved a lot in the previous two years and became not only more powerful but also more usable. We would like to take the opportunity to show what it is capable of by presenting the traditional "A Year in Flink" statistics in a special edition: analysing what happened in the Flink community via Flink SQL queries coded and executed live on stage. This way, you will not only learn how to gather real-time insights with Flink but also what hot topics the Flink community was working on, who the Flink community is and how it is growing, and a lot more.'
