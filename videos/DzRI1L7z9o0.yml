description: "JavaScript: flexible, beginner friendly, and many web developers' first programming language.\nWhat's it like to learn a second language after JavaScript? How do you map JS learnings onto another programming language? Learning Python surrounded by Python developers helped me discover all of JavaScript's weirdnesses.
