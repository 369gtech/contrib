description: "We routinely make systems that exceed our ability to understand completely. Instead, we explore pieces at a time – small local de- tails or large global abstractions, but rarely both at once. But soft- ware is far from unique in this; we’re surrounded by physical and social systems that are too big for any one person to understand. This talk is an exploration of how other, older disciplines have approached these problems, and what we as software engineers can learn from them.\n\nForward 4 kicks off in Feb 2015!
