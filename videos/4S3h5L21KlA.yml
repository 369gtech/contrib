description: "Presented by Bel√©n Barros Pena, Interaction Designer, Open Source Design\n\nWhile I was working as the only designer of the Yocto Project, the embedded Linux engineers in my office did something remarkable. They mustered the patience and the energy to teach Git to yours truly. They did it in stages: they started by how to clone a repository and how to check out its branches, taught me about remotes and how to create my own branches, how to commit my changes, and the etiquette of good commit messages. One glorious day, they decided I was ready to push to a remote repository. By golly I felt powerful. I had mastered Git's mysteries!\n\nBecoming familiar with Git's basic concepts and commands took the best part of 2 years, but it was worth every minute. As a designer, learning Git made me more resilient, more independent and more useful to my development team. Learning Git made me a better designer.\n\nIn this talk, I will try to convince developers that they should invest time and effort in teaching Git to the designers they work with, what they have to gain from it, and how to go about it. \n\nAbout GitMerge\nGit Merge is the pre-eminent Git-focused conference: a full-day offering technical content and user case studies, plus a day of workshops for Git users of all levels. Git Merge is dedicated to amplifying new voices in the Git community and to showcasing the most thought-provoking projects from contributors, maintainers and community managers around the world.
