description: "Talk \nThis short talk will introduce attendees to the concepts of data-driven fits and Gaussian Process (GP), which are used in many different areas in Industry and Academy. It will be briefly explained why and when to use GP with real-life data and also show how to implement this met\n\nSpeaker\nI am a PhD candidate in Astrophysics at the University of Southampton, UK. I work with Supernovae, which are exploding stars. More specifically, I use “Type Ia (one-A) Supernovae” as distance ladders (i.e., to measure distances) in order to have a better understanding of the Universe at large scales, its expansion rate and what causes this expansion (the so-called “Dark Energy”). In addition, I really enjoy using new approaches/methods in my research by trying different machine and deep learning algorithms. I would consider myself a Python expert, but there is still a lot I need to learn and want to discover.\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
