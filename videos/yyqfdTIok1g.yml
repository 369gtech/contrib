title: '[VDZ19] GraalVM & Database Multilingual Engine by Lucas Braun and Julia Kindelsberger'
language: English

description: "GraalVM (Julia): GraalVM is a universal virtual machine for running applications written in JavaScript, Python, Ruby, R, JVM-based languages like Java, Scala, Kotlin, Clojure, and LLVM-based languages such as C and C++. GraalVM removes the isolation between programming languages and enables interoperability in a shared runtime. It can run either standalone or in the context of OpenJDK, Node.js, Oracle DB, or MySQL. With GraalVM you can run Java faster, make your application extensible or create a native image. GraalVM offers a comprehensive ecosystem supporting a large set of languages and running them in different deployment scenarios.\n\nDatabase Multilingual Engine (Lucas): Writing stored procedures and user-defined extension for the Oracle DB requires both in-depth PL/SQL knowledge and long-year experience. Oracle-MLE amends this situation with an architecture for embedding programming languages in the database using GraalVM. Programming languages built on top of GraalVM can execute in the address space of the Oracle DB processes. This enables a tight coupling with the DB query execution engine that reduces the cost of data exchange with programming languages other than PL/SQL."
