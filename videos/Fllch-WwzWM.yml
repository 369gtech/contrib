title: 'Katie McLaughlin - A Right Stitch-up: Creating embroidery patterns with Pillow - PyCon 2019'
recordingDate: 1557097918
description: "\"Speaker: Katie McLaughlin\n\nEmbroidery is a technology that dates back centuries and is still popular in the present day among craftspeople around the world. Cross-stitch refers to the creation of crosses in a grid that combines to build up an image, based on a 'chart' or pattern of the intended design.\n\nEven though entire pieces could be created based on completely manual processes, much of the technology behind automating chart creation is locked behind paid software. \n\nDuring this presentation, we will discuss how we can leverage the Python Imaging Library (PIL, now Pillow) in order to take source images and turn them into cross-stitch charts. \n\nThe resulting art piece from the talk, the PyCon US 2019 logo, will be auctioned off at the PyLadies Charity Auction. Tickets to the Charity Auction available separately, see website for details. \n\n\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2019 and https://github.com/PyCon/2019-slides\""
