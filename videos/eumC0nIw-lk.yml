description: "Arun Nagarajan, Christoph Schwab-Ganser \n\nIn this talk attendees will learn all about the new YouTube Analytics API. We will show the audience how to access the data via Google Apps Script, a cloud scripting platform. We will build and demo ad hoc reporting that extracts parametrized data via the YouTube Analytics API into Google Sheets. We'll also show how some of the reporting can be scheduled and alerts can be fired when thresholds are met. This talk will be of interest to YouTube publishers and also to developers looking to do more with Google Apps Scripts and Google Sheets.\n\nFor all I/O 2013 sessions, go to https://developers.google.com/live"
