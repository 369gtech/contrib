language: English
recordingDate: 1430267991
description: "The ISS provides Dragon Age fans with an online cinematic overview of the choices they’ve made in the Dragon Age games. Though simple in concept, building a super low-bandwidth (~100x less than video), interactive, localizable experience for every screen (mobile, tablet, desktop, and console), while empowering the creative team to deliver top-notch results pushed the boundaries of what’s possible with modern web tech.\n\nThis talk will explore the challenges, technologies, processes, and results of the project. Topics include: resolution and aspect ratio independence, device performance strategies, creative tooling and process, localization approaches, CreateJS, and the HTML5 canvas.\n\nGrant Skinner\nCEO, Gskinner.com\nhttp://www.twitter.com/gskinner\nhttps://github.com/gskinner/\nhttps://github.com/createjs/\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
