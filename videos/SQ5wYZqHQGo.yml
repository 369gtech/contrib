description: "From the 2015 Velocity Conference in New York: I’m going to talk about cognitive bias in operations land. I will go through two examples.\n\nThe first example is how cognitive biases can help us miss the next great thing. In this case, I will show how we could have almost missed the Docker revolution. I’ll use this example to draw parallels and build up a transition to my second point.\n\nThe second example is the meat of the talk. In this example I’ll reflect on how blindly rejecting ideas from others unlike yourself is the biggest diversity/integration issue in tech and society.\n\nThe talk will end with bold assertions about why we are in the tech industry. I will fall short of proposing a solution, but will leave with tech’s problems are society’s problems, and we have to think bigger in our search for solutions.\n\nAbout Bryan Liles (DigitalOcean):\nBryan Liles works on strategic initiatives for DigitalOcean. In layman’s terms, this means he writes OSS for DigitalOcean and others. He helps communities move their software to the public cloud, and gets to speak at conferences on topics ranging from Machine Learning to how build the next generation of developers. When not thinking about code, Bryan races cars in straight lines and around turns and builds robots and devices\n\nWatch more from Velocity NYC 2015: https://goo.gl/PZAqiY\nVisit the Velocity website: http://velocityconf.com/\nDon't miss an upload!
