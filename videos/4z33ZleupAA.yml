It allows you to automatically verify that your app's GUI renders correctly across all devices, browsers, and screen resolutions. In this session, we will take a deep dive into some of the technological challenges involved with visual test automation and show how modern tools address them. We will review available open-source and commercial visual testing tools, demo cutting edge technologies that enable running cross browser and cross device visual tests at large scale, and show how visual test automation fits in the development / deployment lifecycle.\n\nIf you don't know what visual testing is, if you think that Sikuli is a visual test automation tool, if you are already automating your visual tests and want to learn more on what else is out there, if you are on your way to implement Continuous Deployment or just interested in seeing how cool image processing algorithms can be, this talk is for you!"
