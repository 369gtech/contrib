description: "Presentation from the 'Agile Riga Day 2012' conferenece.\r\n\r\nThesis: In order to have control over software project, a customer needs to have a contract that holds a supplier's feet to the fire and fixes the price and scope of what is delivered.\r\n\r\nAntithesis: Effective projects require collaboration between a customer and a supplier. A contract that fixes the price and scope of the project undermines the trust needed for this collaboration.\r\n\r\nSynthesis: Target price contract aligns the incentives of the supplier and the customer towards making the scope match the budget. This gives the customer control over the price and value of the created software while maintaining a collaborative environment.\r\n\r\nWebsite: http://www.agilerigaday.lv/Sessions/agile-contracts-thesis-antithesis-synthesis"
