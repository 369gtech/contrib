description: "Looking back and forward onto ten years of work as a cutting edge design studio – with undaunted enthusiasm and only a pinch of nostalgia.\n\nA new way of design and visual communication, made possible by code and technology, was the starting point of FIELD ten years ago – where does their focus shift now that the ideas of procedural, generative, machine learning are nearly ubiquitous? What are the ‘Aesthetics of the Future’ now – what can we as artists and designers contribute to the pressing questions of our time?\n\nDotted with key projects both old and new, Vera will ponder over the ideas and values that have stayed with them, which dreams have come true and which ones turned out irrelevant, and how you need to change to stay true to yourself.\n\nVera-Maria Glahn\nfield.io\nhttps://twitter.com/field_io\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttps://fitc.ca/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=video-description\n\nSave 10% off any FITC event with discount code 'youtube'.\nSee our upcoming events at https://fitc.ca/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=video-description"
