recordingDate: 1575469982
description: 'We are working with Coinbase to create Toshi; an instant messaging app with the ability to painlessly send money across the globe. The app is simple, but the technology behind it is not. We create a cryptographically secure wallet on the device, broadcast money transfers on the Ethereum blockchain, and send messages encrypted using the Signal protocol. Join this talk to learn about cryptocurrencies, what they are, how they work, and what they can be used for.'
