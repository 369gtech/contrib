description: "I’ve always wanted to have conversations with past versions of myself, but I worried about the dangerous side effects of using time machines. With the emergence of deep learning and the seq2seq model, a new solution is available!\n\nUsing chat logs I’ve archived since early high school, I’ve trained one chat bot on messages from my teenage years, and paired it up with a bot trained on more recent messages. Hilarity will ensue as I algorithmically converse with a version of myself that’s younger, has significantly worse taste in music, and holds quirky political beliefs. We’ll also learn how easy it is to get started with machine learning, TensorFlow, and seq2seq!\n\nEVENT:\n\n!!Con 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nAndrew Louis\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnFYs5BdI0E&t=10s"
