description: "Products may be or become complicated for many reasons, and teams are often asked to make them “simpler and better.” How do we identify when and why something is complicated, and how can we make it simpler? David will talk about methods to make products and experiences simpler, some of the considerations and decisions we may face when tackling complication, and look at some examples of products that made themselves simpler without sacrificing features and functionality.\n\nEVENT:\n\nfitc 2019\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nDavid Hogue\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nConference Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nSave 10% off any FITC event with discount code 'youtube'.
