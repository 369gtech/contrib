title: 'YOW! West 2017 Christopher Biggs - The Internet Of Scary Things'
recordingDate: 1497234293
description: "The Internet of Things (IoT) has recently been somewhat of a laughing stock, with poorly designed and managed IoT devices being associated with severe privacy leaks, theft of service, and botnet-perpetrated denial-of-service attacks. The currently circulating joke goes “The S in IoT stands for Security!”\n\nThis presentation covers how to recognise and avoid risks to your business from adopting IoT, some best practices for selecting and deploying IoT devices, and most importantly, for developers of IoT products, how to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past, through good architecture, quality processes and use of the right tools and frameworks. I will talk about ways to ensure that less-secure or rogue devices cannot damage your network or the Internet at large, how to monitor and control your IoT devices to keep them safe and functional, and how to choose among the growing collection of incompatible frameworks for IoT systems.\n\nIoT is the Wild West – Criminals have outrun the Law, but the Law, and good development practices, are catching up. My presentation will teach you about the  guidelines, traps, tools and frameworks that you need to know about to avoid becoming the next “IoT is…” joke.\n\nChristopher Biggs has been into Open Systems since the early 90s and was there at the birth of Linux and 386BSD. His interest in electronics and connected devices goes back even further. He has worked as a developer, System Architect and Engineering Manager. He was founding Vice President of HUMBUG, the Brisbane open systems user group, and built and managed a diverse, inclusive team of over 60 developers at a leading Brisbane IT company. He has presented at conferences and user groups around Australia, and convened a weekly technology lecture series for the entire technology department at a previous workplace. Christopher is the principal of Accelerando Consulting, a boutique  consultancy specialising in IoT and Cloud Data. In his spare time he builds and blogs robots and adds to the growing Internet of Things.\n\nFor more on YOW! West, visit http://west.yowconference.com.au"
