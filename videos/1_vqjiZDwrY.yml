recordingDate: 1493230929
description: "Have you ever been disappointed by the relevancy of search results on your Drupal site?\n\nDid you ever feel your Drupal’s core search is insanely slow?\n\nEver wondered how to scale search on Drupal to millions of queries per second and piles of data?\n\nEver felt the need of being able to search through the contents of file attachment through your site’s search?\n\nApachesolr has been the most popular search backend for Drupal since long. ApacheSolr Search module and Search API Solr module provided the two most popular options for integrating Solr with Drupal. The two modules have now joined forces in D8 to become the highly powerful Search API Solr module for Drupal 8!\n\nIn this session for Site Builders, we discuss\_Apachesolr - an open source search platform that can be easily integrated with Drupal 8.\n\nWe won’t be writing any code (yeah, not even a line) and you will be amazed to learn all that you can achieve using the suite of Solr modules to build a blazing fast search for your Drupal website without any coding!\n\nThis session will give a rundown of building an advanced search system using Search API suite of Solr Modules. We will cover the following, showing live demonstrations of the required configuration.\n\nWhat Apache Solr is and why you should consider using it?\n\nSetting up a solr server yourself vs Hosted options available\n\nInstalling and configuring the Search API Solr module\n\nUnderstanding the index and the indexing process\n\nUsing the contributed Facets module: We will demonstrate live building some commonly used facets\n\nAutocomplete functionality for your search\n\nFuzzy search: Dealing with spelling mistakes and variations\n\n‘Did you mean…’ suggestions for synonyms and close keywords\n\nTuning search results using bias to influence result relevancy\n\nPreprocessing search results using stopwords, highlight, tokenizer\n\nIndexing and searching of attachments\n\nBuild views that run on Solr\n\nWe will also discuss some additional contrib modules available in the Search API ecosystem that you can plug and play very easily.\_\n\nThis session is aimed at Site Builders who are familiar with installing and configuring modules. Familiarity with coding is not expected and we will not be writing any code throughout the session. No prior knowledge of the Search API or related modules is required.\n\n\n\nSite Building Videos from the session are \_available at http://bit.ly/beyondsolr"
