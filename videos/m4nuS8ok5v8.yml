title: 'Earth Moon Earth (EME) Radio Propagation'
recordingDate: 1484832270
description: "Rex Moncur\nhttp://linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/177/\nThis  talk will focus on the Amateur radio use of PCs to detect signals up to 30 dB below the noise after reflection from the Moon.  These techniques have been developed by Nobel Laureate Professor Joe Taylor and Rex has conducted experimental work to support Joe's work.  Rex's goal in this  work is to reflect signals off the Moon with as small an antenna and as low a power as possible.  \r\n\r\nThe best result to date is the reflection of signals from the Moon and back to stations in Europe with just 5 watts from a small 77 cm dish.  For this audience who will be used to data rates of many mega bits/second you are warned in advance that the data rates are the order of only 1 bit/second."
