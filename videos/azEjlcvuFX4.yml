description: "The speech was given by:\n- Tomasz Dzierżanowski (Bank BNP Paribas Polska SA), \n- Rafał Piotrowski (Bank BNP Paribas Polska SA), \n- Leszek Jaskierny (DXC.technology)\n\nWhy would the elephant REST?\nIt's hard not to notice the pace and scope of changes that inevitably impact the way traditional businesses are being run. The big question for all complex, regulated organizations is how to be able to keep up with them and avoid being outpaced by smaller and by far more agile challengers. The main thesis that we will challenge in our discussion panel is that obtaining the capability to expose new services and provide access to data in a timely manner could be a game changer for the Bank in order to be a beneficiary of new business models and partnerships. Join our discussion to get your own opinion on whether we should keep pushing the elephant to REST and whether API Gateway could be a silver bullet allowing the development of new products and services to Bank’s customers.\n\nThe speech took on 8th May 2019 on DevTrends Stage during Infoshare 2019."
