description: "Subscribe to our channel: https://youtube.pl/c/DevoxxPoland?sub_confirmation=1\n\nWhat are reliable ways of building responsive and scalable services? What does it means for our programs to be asynchronous and back pressured and why is it important? This talks aims to answer these questions. We’ll cover:\n\nThread per request vs asynchronous services\nWhat back pressure is and how to do it all the way down to the network layer\nHow to achieve all of this with Akka HTTP and Akka Streams\nHow it compares to other tools for asynchronous programming e.g. CompletableFutures, Observables\nReactive streams specification and API\nTime permitting we’ll also demo a networked application built with Akka sending back pressure through the application layer, through TCP and into the client application.\n#ScalableSystems #Akka #Streams\n\nPresented by Christopher Batey\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DevoxxPL\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/grzegorz.duda.official/\n\nJoin us also here:\nTechnology Radar Review: https://dworld.pl/radar\nDevelopers World Academy: https://dworld.pl/akademia\nDevflix: https://devflix.pl\n\n#Devoxx #DevoxxPoland #IT #Development #SoftwareDevelopment"
