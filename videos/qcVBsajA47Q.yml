description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2012\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nSteve Freeman - Pioneer of Agile, Chair the first London XpDay\nNat Pryce - Author of \"Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests\" and developer of the jMock mock-object library\n\nABSTRACT\nThis talk will describe what we've learned during our journey into physical computing with the RaspberryPi. At Quick2Wire, we're developing hardware and software for novice hobbyists and schools. This has required us learning some new skills and remembering some old ones. We will talk about the design of the Quick2Wire hardware, which simplifies attaching multiple external devices, our Python API, which simplifies programming with those devices.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
