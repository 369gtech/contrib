description: "Speaker: JEANNE BOYARSKY SOFTWARE DEVELOPER, CODERANCH\nComing soon - Java 9 is nearing official release. As Java developers, we should be ready. Java 9 is more than just Jigsaw and we will look at some of the still useful but less talked about features. Some will save you typing and make your code easier to read such as changes to try-with-resources and inner classes. Some are new APIs that will save you time like new stream APIs. Attendees will walk away knowing whatâ€™s new and improved in Java 9 regardless of whether they need to complete a jigsaw puzzle."
