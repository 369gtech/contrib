title: 'RabbitMQ is the new king'
recordingDate: 1393963032
description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2013 in Santa Clara, CA.\nSpeakers: Alvaro Videla, Jan Machacek\nJan will show how to use RabbitMQ to connect components on different platforms. After a few introductory slides explaining the main concepts, the rest of the talk will be live code. The coding will begin by showing Spring Integration code to connect to RabbitMQ to send and receive messages--think byte[] values back and forth to start with. Jan will then show the real power of RabbitMQ by replacing the RPC server component by native code in C++: we will write image processing component. To make matters even better--faster--we will then use CUDA to perform the image processing. Come to Jan's talk and demo if you want to find out how to use RabbitMQ in the core of your application, especially if your application needs to tie together code on completely different platforms and if it performs heavy number crunching or image processing. You do not need to have deep knowledge of Spring Integration, AMQP or OpenCV, ...; all that you will need is your inner geek.\nLearn more about RabbitMQ at http://www.rabbitmq.com\nLearn more about Spring AMQP at http://projects.spring.io/spring-amqp/"
