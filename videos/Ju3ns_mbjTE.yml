title: 'Scientific Computing with Clojure - Kyle Harrington'

description: "Scientific computing has generally been restricted to procedural and object-oriented programming languages, such as C/C++, Java, Python, etc.. We have developed Clojure-based projects to support not only analysis of scientific data, but also scientific simulations. Our analysis tools are applied to biomedical data, in particular biological imaging of clinical human samples and high-resolution subcellular microscopy images. Our simulations are used for modeling ecological and evolutionary dynamics, as well as multi-cellular biological systems. The use of Clojure has facilitated the growth of our software ecosystem due to the power of Clojure to manage code complexity. Furthermore, the ability to rapidly prototype compact yet complex code has allowed us to advance on many fronts of scientific computing simultaneously.\n\nAbout the speaker: Kyle Harrington is a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard Medical School in the Center for Vascular Biology Research of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. With 20+ years of programming experience, the last 5 being focused on Clojure, and PhD in Computer Science, he is applying functional programming techniques to scientific computing and image processing problems. This involves simulations on high-performance computing clusters, and analysis of multi-gigabyte biomedical images. Thanks to the vivacious and clever Clojure community the application of Clojure to scientific problems has been a productive way of tackling new computational problems."
