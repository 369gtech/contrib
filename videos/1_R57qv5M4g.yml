recordingDate: 1523543987
description: "Let's face it.\_ Drupal hosting can get complex, and we've all seen the effects Shared Hosting can have on a Drupal site.\_ There is a reason \"Drupal\" hosting providers exist and have specially tuned stacks specifically for Drupal websites.\_ For these very reasons, many people have their \"go-to\" hosting provider for Drupal sites that they recommend for clients.\_ So what happens when, just before launch, a client decides to throw a curve ball at you and put a new hosting requirement in the myth.\_ \"Hi, we just got your email about the cost of hosting with XYZ for our new site.\_ IT said that they would just host it in-house.\_ The site works on Oracle DB2, right?\".\_ Or, even better, \"We're just going to throw this on our existing, Windows servers on Microsoft Azure.\_ They've got the best pricing for SQL Server anyway.\"\n\nDespite your best recommendations and directions otherwise, sometimes site owners get in their heads that they know the best way to host their site despite any performance problems it may cause.\_ Come learn some tips and tricks for what happens when you have to host a website on private infrastructure that you have no visibility in to.\_ Come learn how to get Drupal 8 running in a reasonable manner on Microsoft Azure (including some performance settings not documented in Microsoft's documentation).\_ These tips and tuning tweaks will be shared with you based on my experience from the trenches in many of these very scenarios.\_ You'll be able to file these tips away, just in case you ever end up in the same situation."
