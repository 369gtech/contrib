recordingDate: 1191897750
description: "Google Tech Talks\nMarch 14, 2007\n\nABSTRACT\n\nPhotographic Technology Day 8:  This session addresses effects of the wave nature of light. This approach will allow us to talk about the phenomena of interference as well as diffraction. The understanding of the notion of diffraction will be used to determine the Rayleigh criteria and finally the resolving power of an optical system. In the second part of the lecture, we will study gratings using the wave approach. An example of an amateur spectroscope for astronomy using a reflective grating will be shown.
