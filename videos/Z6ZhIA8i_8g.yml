description: "WebAssembly (or Wasm) is a compilation target for the open web; often considered a hard-to-approach performance optimisation for your browser applications - but it promises to be so much more than that!\n\nIt’s beginning to reshape how, and where, our applications can run, giving us the freedom to choose whichever language is best suited for the job, and the most appropriate location to run it, be that the client, edge or server.\n\nIn this talk we’ll debunk some myths about WebAssembly and explore what it is and what it isn’t, its challenges, look at how we can use it practically in applications today, and what the future holds, both in the browser and beyond!\n\nSlides: https://noti.st/patrickhamann/uEw4zt/webassembly-to-the-browser-and-beyond\nAbout Patrick: https://twitter.com/patrickhamann\n\nMore about performance.now(); https://perfnow.nl or https://twitter.com/perfnowconf\nReceive conference announcements in your inbox: https://perfnow.nl/subscribe"
