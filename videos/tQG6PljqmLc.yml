description: 'First there was Firebug, now Chrome DevTools, but recently IE''s developer tools have taken a quantum leap forward in version 11, and Mozilla has some unique new features to their built in tools. Tools outside of the browser now integrate far more intelligently, and it''s even possible to use one browser''s devtools to inspect a different browser. Are we still looking for the best tool workflow, or is there room for all these different tools?'
