recordingDate: 1483401665
description: "Change in an organization is really hard. This is especially true when a company that was once on the forefront of innovation finds itself having lost that luster through its own growth & success. The past few years there has been a transformation happening at PayPal that is touching every part of the organization to make it innovative again. At the heart of this change is engineering innovation coupled with a new, close partnership between product, design and engineering.\n\nCan your organization be changed? From Bill’s experience at Yahoo!, Netflix, PayPal and consulting with numerous companies he believes there are some core principles you can employ to drive transformation that are all centered around the customer. The question Bill will explore is “How can engineering and design be the catalyst for that change?” While this talk will be inspirational, it will take an honest (and humorous) look at what has worked and what hasn’t worked so well in trying to scale change.\n\nBill leads PayPal’s Next Gen Commerce Team, small, nimble, cross-functional team that is focused on enabling next-gen, social and context-aware commerce.\n\nPrior to this Bill led the worldwide merchant engineering organization as well as the Payment Products teams. Before that he formed & led the PayPal UI Engineering teams.\n\nBill is co-author of the O’Reilly book Designing Web Interfaces. In addition, he is a frequent speaker at conferences & workshops discussing the nuances of good design and the challenges of great engineering.\n\nPrior to PayPal, he led & established the UI Eng practice at Netflix. He & his team built the Netflix experience for the web, the first HTML5 TV experiences. Later Bill focused on the eCommerce stack where he & his team built the non-member & account services products across 43 countries on multiple devices (e.g., PS3, Wii, etc.).\n\nBill led both experience & engineering at Meebo and spent time consulting for startups and large enterprises doing everything from conducting usability studies, to wireframing, to writing lots of JavaScript code to presenting business strategy ideas to CEOs.\n\nAt Yahoo!, Bill led Y! Teachers, a web 2.0 community allowing teachers to gather, organize & share web resources. In addition, as Y! Ajax Evangelist he spread the gospel of “rich and sane” Ajax design & development. He also participated in aspects of the YUI library and as Design Pattern curator launched the public Yahoo! Design Pattern Library.\n\nHe also co-wrote one of first JavaScript Ajax libraries (Rico).\n\nFor 30 years Bill has focused on roles in both UX design as well as UI engineering: creating products in areas as diverse as video games, widget libraries, war gaming, IDE tools, airline management and Web consumer sites & apps.\n\nFor more on YOW!
