description: "Robert van MoÌˆlken\nSenior Integration Specialist\nAMIS Services BV\n\nDuring this developer session you will learn how to build your own practical blockchain using the open-source, freely available Hyperledger Fabric and Composer, its design tool. At the start of the presentation I will shortly introduce Hyperledger Fabric as our blockchain of choice, how it relates to other (private) blockchains and how Composer will help us build our application. This developer session will go through the pre-requirements, how to run a blockchain, generating artifacts, starting and stopping the network and writing your first blockchain application. At the end of this deep-dive you know how to design and setup a practical blockchain application and understand the concepts behind it."
