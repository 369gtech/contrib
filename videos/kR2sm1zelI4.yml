From the site: \"Resilience4j is a fault tolerance library designed for Java8 and functional programming.\" In particular, Resilience4J provides an implementation of the Circuit Breaker pattern, which prevents a network or service failure from cascading to other services. But now Istio also provides the same capability.\nIn this talk, we will have a look at how Istio and Resilience4J implement the Circuit Breaker pattern, and what pros/cons each of [...]\r\n\r\nRead the full abstract here:\r\nhttps://gotober.com/2019/sessions/1063/battle-of-the-circuit-breakers-resilience4j-vs-istio\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOber\r\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\r\n#Kubernetes #k8s #Microservices #Istio #Resilience4J #Java #SoftwareArchitecture #DevOps\r\n\r\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\r\nAttend the next GOTO Conference near you!
