description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nCloud Native & SD-WAN: Improving K8s Application Experience Over SD-WAN - Alberto Rodriguez-Natal, Cisco & Mark Church, Google \n\nAccess to Kubernetes-hosted applications across Wide Area Networks (WANs) is a standard pattern for Enterprise apps. Software-Defined WAN (SD-WAN) technologies have democratized access patterns across the Internet through latency reduction, throughput improvement, and packet loss prevention. However, integration between SD-WAN and K8s is still an emerging field, despite the automation opportunities. This talk shows how to link K8s application attributes with SD-WAN network capabilities. The recently open-sourced Cloud-Native SD-WAN (CNWAN) K8s Operator offers a reference implementation for how SD-WAN controllers can use K8s application metadata to optimize application WAN traffic. This talk discusses developer workflows for deploying K8s-hosted apps defining WAN attributes and patterns for publishing those apps via service discovery systems as an interface for SD-WAN controllers. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ekCK"
