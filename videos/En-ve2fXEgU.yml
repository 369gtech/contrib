description: "Microservices, distributed systems in sheep's clothing, have been around in various forms since the 1960s! We trek down amnesia lane, finding that what we’re doing has been done before, but the names and tools have changed.\n\nWhether it’s Netflix OSS, Spring Cloud, or any other open source framework for microservices, we’ve likely experienced using them all at one point. What have using these frameworks taught us? Do they help or hinder us? Is Service Mesh the answer? I’ll explore these questions as we meander along a journey through the past.\n\nVoxxed Days Microservices 2018: 2 days conference (+1 optional workshops day) only on Microservices. \n\nFollow us on :\nWebsite : https://voxxeddays.com/microservices (bit.ly/vxdmicro)\nTwitter : https://twitter.com/vxdmicroservice\nLinkedin : https://www.linkedin.com/in/voxxed-days-microservices-906115164\nKeep in touch : https://t.co/pxf7cHZOpl\n\n#developers #conference #microservices"
