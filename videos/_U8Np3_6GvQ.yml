description: "It’s 2000. I’m 15. I run a semi-popular personal website made with greymatter that gets a few thousand hits a week (which isn’t bad for me complaining about school and my mom), a live journal community with over 6000 members, and contribute & code a music website for other teens that lets me get into tons of shows for free and interview bands.\n\nLet me tell you about what I use to build things, and my favorite places online."
