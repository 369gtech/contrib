description: "Ближайшая конференция — DotNext 2020 Moscow\n2-5 декабря, Online\nПодробности и билеты: https://dotnext-moscow.ru/\n\n. Рассказ о принципах работы главной .NET-организации.\n\nFoundations sound horribly boring, but if you love building and using open source software, they're actually really cool.\n\nAs the executive director of the .NET Foundation, one of Jon's most difficult tasks was figuring out how to describe what the .NET Foundation actually is, let alone why anyone should actually care. Foundations can do a lot for the community, and maybe for your open source project. And that just got a lot more real with our recent changes to include open membership and community elections. Find out how you can get involved!"
