description: "Recording brought to you by American Express https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs\nPlaying games is fun but making games is even better, especially with Kotlin and libGDX. Let's build together a breakout game and let's explore the gaming framework libGDX.\n\nThis session will show some libGDX's concepts: how to draw and animate elements of our game, how collision system works to destroy our bricks, what Kotlin brings to libGDX. Then we will dive into more advanced topics like shaders, in order to handle pixels from our images. Why are we doing all of this? To break the high score, of course!\n\nAbout David Wursteisen:\nTechnologies shoudn't be an issue. Instead it should help you to build better products"
