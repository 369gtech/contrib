language: English
recordingDate: 1449594410
description: "We’ve been hearing a lot of hype about microservices and why we all should embrace them and design our software as suites of independently deployable services. This session shows how a Java EE programming model is a big enabler for decoupling monoliths and how well-written Java EE applications can be deployed as microservices without code changes. It discusses\n• Understanding where a Java EE programming model can help you build a decoupled codebase\n• How we can leverage CDI extensions (through JMS and proxies) to deploy Java EE components as microservices\n• How to deploy Java EE components into a cloud-enabled microservices setup\nAttendees can expect to see a running demo of a Java EE application deployed as microservices units in the cloud.\n\nSpeaker:\nAlexandre Porcelli, Principal Software Engineer, Red Hat\nAlexandre Porcelli is Principal Software Engineer at JBoss by Red Hat, proud member of Drools&jBPM team and co-founder of UberFire. Professional developer since 1996, has been working exclusively on Open Source projects for almost a decade. Since joined Red Hat he has been focusing on web enabled of the Drools&jBPM platforms redefining all web tooling and now engaged on cloud enabled of its architecture.
