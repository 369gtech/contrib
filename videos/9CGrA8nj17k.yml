language: English
recordingDate: 1433515460
description: "Hybrid, multilanguage approaches to technology have become commonplace, and so have the build and automation challenges that accompany them. Today even the smallest projects tend to involve multiple frameworks, languages, and approaches to managing dependencies. This session shows how Gradle was designed to provide conventions for Java, Scala, Groovy, JavaScript, and Objective-C, among other languages, and it leaves the audience with specific examples of how to approach builds that span a range of technologies.\n\n\nAuthors:\nTim OBrien\nTim has authored and co-authored a number of books for O’Reilly including: Maven: The Definitive Guide, The Jakarta Commons Cookbook, Maven: A Developer’s Notebook, and Harnessing Hibernate. He has also written a number of popular open source books including: Maven by Example, Maven: The Complete Reference, Repository Management with Nexus, and The Maven Cookbook. \n\nTim consults for various companies providing support for development infrastructure, developer operations, and hybrid architecture support. \nView more trainings by Tim OBrien at https://www.parleys.com/author/tim-obrien-1\n\nHans Dockter\nHans Dockter is the founder and project lead of Gradle and the CEO of Gradle Inc..
