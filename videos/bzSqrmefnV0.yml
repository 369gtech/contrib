description: "... regardless of Aging and Weight changes, with Ruth Yakubu\n\nLet's \"face\" it,... people's faces change over a period of time which makes facial recognition solutions difficult or inaccurate. In this session, I will demo how to use Artificial Intelligence and build a Java application that detects and tags people's faces by name. Then, I will use java to Train various images of each a person’s face to be easily detected, recognized, searched and identified by name. I will show scenarios where this is useful when a person ages, loses/gains weight, hair etc over time. Finally, I will show how a person can by detected and identified in a crowd as well using this AI application."
