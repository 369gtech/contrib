To examine the experiences, perspectives, and privacy concerns of domestic workers, we begin with a case study of nannies and of parents who employ nannies. We conducted 26 interviews with nannies and 16 with parents. This paper describes the research agenda, motivation, and methodology for our study, along with preliminary findings.\n\nView the full FOCI '20 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/foci20/workshop-program"
