description: "Bio:\n\nJaroslav Tulach is the founder and initial architect of NetBeans, which is not just a well known IDE, but also the first modular desktop application framework written in Java. Maintaining NetBeans Platform, its architecture and APIs has always been the primary focus of Jaroslav. During more than fifteen years of participating in the NetBeans.org project, Jaroslav has seen, made and helped to recover from many design mistakes.

The GeekOut tutorial is going to be based on Jaroslav's recent experience with making NetBeans APIs better with the help of compile time annotations.\n\nMore details at: http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/GeekOut \n\n\nPresentation:\nIntroduction to bck2brwsr project.\n\nA year ago I started to play with the idea of small Java that would fit into any modern browser and run without any plugins. After a year I managed to reach several milestones. I have special, slim API for controlling an HTML page front end from Java. I can run the system on desktop, some mobile phones/platforms and also directly in a browser. I have IDE tooling that makes creating such clients real fun. Overall I am starting to believe that coding in my Java/HTML mixture is more effective, compact and more errorprone than using JavaScript instead.\n\nThe work is not finished, but I believe there is a lot to show. Stop by, I'll be glad share the direction to get Java bck2brwsr..."
