title: 'RAFAEL BENEVIDES - Service Mesh and Sidecars with Istio and Envoy'
language: English
recordingDate: 1544126022
description: 'The first generation of microservices was primarily shaped by Netflix OSS and leveraged by numerous Spring Cloud annotations all throughout your business logic. The next generation of microservices will leverage sidecars and a service mesh. In this session, we will give you a taste of Envoy and Istio, two open source projects that will change the way you write distributed Java applications on Kubernetes. Check out how we use Envoy and Istio to deal with traffic shaping, network fault-injection, A/B testing, dark launches, mirroring and much more.'
