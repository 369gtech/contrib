description: "This video was recorded at Code Elixir LDN 19 \nGet involved in Code Syncâ€™s next conference http://bit.ly/2Mcm4aS\n\n---\nTypeclasses: the value of programming vocabulary\nby Mikael Muszynski\n\nMonoids, Applicatives, Monads and Semigroups. What are these things?\nMuch more importantly, however, why should one care?\nElixir programmers are blessed with a language that allows them to be productive, seemingly without needing to reach for these arcane spells. And yet, for building architectures we have spells like \"GenServer\" and \"Supervisor\", among others.\nMaybe we can find useful tools in the ivory tower of Haskell?\n\nOBJECTIVES\nIntroduce the concept of typeclasses to the uninitiated.\nInspire a sense of marvel over the kaleidoscope of ways to categorize things. \nLead the audience to a library that lets them explore typeclasses in Elixir (https://github.com/expede/witchcraft).\n\nInspire the audience to seek out the words that are useful for describing their everyday work.\n\nAUDIENCE\nProgrammers primarily experienced in dynamically typed languages, who are curious about the alleged benefits of the contraptions that they make up in the ivory tower of Haskell.\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nHaskell,\nTypeclass,\nMusings\n\nTALK LEVEL: Intermediate users\n\n---\n\nMikael Muszynski\nElixir consultant, Haskell amateur, tea enthusiast\nRuby programmer that liked Haskell throughout his whole career. Eventually ended up in Erlang Solutions, where he gets to write functional code, primarily Elixir.\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE ELIXIR LDN 19\nCODE ELIXIR LDN is powered by Code Sync. CODE ELIXIR LDN 19 was sponsored by Duffel, Cultivate, Erlang Solutions, Scout, Dice, aeternity and Toyota Connected.\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC\nWebsite: www.codesync.global\nTwitter: www.twitter.com/CodeElixirIO\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/CodeSyncGlobal\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/code-sync/\nMail: info at codesync.global"
