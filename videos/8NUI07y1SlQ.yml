title: 'Daniel Solano Gomez - How Clojure Works: Understanding the Clojure Runtime'
recordingDate: 1395719590
description: "REPL-driven development in Clojure seems almost magical to programmers coming from languages with long recompile or redeploy cycles. It's something Clojure programmers often take for granted, but how does Clojure actually work, and what are the trade-offs made to support it?\n\nThis session will highlight how key aspects of the Clojure runtime work, such as namespaces, static and dynamic vars, and class reloading. You will also learn how the current implementation impedes some static bytecode analysis and impacts startup speed. Finally, this session will present ideas on how to create a lean, high-performance Clojure runtime intended for production use."
