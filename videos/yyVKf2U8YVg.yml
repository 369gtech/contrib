description: "User interfaces that have to display clear and efficient information to users can be quite a challenge when the sources of the information are spread throughout a complex organization as services. Netflix and Facebook pioneered graph query approaches to help solve this problem, but Clojure and Clojurescript offer some compelling tools that give effective ways of working in these situations: Pathom, Fulcro, Datomic, Clojure Spec, and more.\n\nWe have hundreds of such services at Nubank, and we have a significant amount of customer support software. In this talk, I’ll share how we combine these technologies and ideas to design an approach that allows many teams to work independently on UI components that can compose nicely to form full‐featured user interfaces."
