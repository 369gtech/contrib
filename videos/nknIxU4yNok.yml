description: "\"Two guys, 1 month, from an idea to a demo product. The story of 106 AWS Lambdas.\" by Karol Junde\nJust imagine you have an idea which is trying to blow up your head. Let's picture that you've got 1 month to implement it and no available Ops that time to take it on their shoulders the infrastructure part. Moreover, it's just an idea, even if promising, should not burn the budget and be able to scale accordingly to the number of requests since the first minute of its existence. No matter if the idea was born in a division of a huge enterprise or in founders' minds of a new unicorn, the path might be similar. I'll show you my road with an entirely serverless approach."
