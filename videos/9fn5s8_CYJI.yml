description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2019 by Fred Porciúncula, Blinkist.\n\nMore info: http://androidmakers.fr/schedule/?sessionId=YYF-6635\n\nDagger is a complex tool, we can all agree on that. It's also the most performant and scalable dependency injector we have available -- no wonder it's the official recommendation from Google when it comes to dependency injection for Android apps. And yet, we keep looking for simpler alternatives (usually service locators) just so we don't have to deal with it.\n\nEven thought Dagger is complex, it doesn't have to be complicated. It's possible to keep things simple and still take advantage of what it offers at its core. There are many ways to setup Dagger, and believe it or not, some of them are quite simple. The goal of this talk is to present a simplistic approach to Dagger, where we can take advantage of dependency injection with minimal boilerplate and optimum performance. On top of that, we'll be looking in details on best practices and how to ensure you're taking the most out of Dagger.\n\nJoin me if you've had unpleasant experiences with Dagger -- or even if you're happy with your current setup -- so we can take a fresh look on how we can work with it. And if you haven't worked with Dagger before, this is the perfect opportunity to get off on the right foot!\n\nAlex Karp Production"
