description: "Full title: From 1 to infinity  how to scale your tech organization, build a great culture and keep your sanity\n\nAs a technology leader, one of your most challenging tasks is to bootstrap a new tech organization and grow it to tens or even hundreds of people. In this talk I will share my learnings from 20+ years of experience as member and leader of several tech teams and hacker cultures. We will follow the journey, the successes and the mistakes of a startup founder: starting by himself and eventually growing to a 100+ people organization."
