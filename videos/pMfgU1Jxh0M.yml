title: 'Deploying 5 Java Frameworks in 5 Different Ways to the Cloud by Ed Burns'
recordingDate: 1581884634
description: "The Java Ecosystem is versatile and diverse. There are roughly 20+ Java back-end frameworks in active development today. When it comes to deploying to the cloud, there are many ways of doing so. Is it a JAR, a WAR, an EAR? Are you going to deploy as a self-contained application to a platform service or are you going to put inside a container? VM, Kubernetes, OpenShift, CloudFoundry? When it comes to Cloud vendors, the deployment options are also very diverse. This session will look into how to deploy 5 major Java Frameworks and/or Platforms: Spring Boot, MicroProfile with Quarkus, Java EE with Oracle WebLogic Server, Helidon and plain Java SE; on 5 common ways of running Java services in the Cloud. As part of the demonstrations, this session will use services from Microsoft Azure that are also analogously available at Amazon Web Services as well as Google Cloud Platform and other cloud vendors.\n\nEd Burns\nMicrosoft\n\nRecorded at Jfokus 2020 in Stockholm 4th of february\nhttp://www.jfokus.se"
