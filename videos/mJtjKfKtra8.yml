title: 'O''Reilly Webcast: Stylish Structure- XML Publishing with Adobe InDesign'
recordingDate: 1363649239
description: "*Note: Audio quality not very clear\n\nTraditional XML publishing uses XSLT to make web pages and XSL-FO to make printable PDFs from XML sources. Book and magazine publishers are frustrated by the limited styling and \"untweakable\" output of the PDF process. Adobe InDesign offers a more flexible and typographically expressive alternative, but there are plenty of challenges in the process. This webcast looks at what's possible, what's feasible and what is problematic in using InDesign to publish XML.\n\nAbout Dorothy Hoskins\n\nDorothy Hoskins is an XML evangelist, always learning new things to help her play with XML, but her true love is the development of processes that tie together various applications for publishing XML to both print and web. The new version of her book \"XML Publishing with InDesign\" (January 2013) includes content up to InDesign CS6.\n\nCurrently Dorothy is assists publishers with XML workflows. Besides creating server-side XSLT for a global corporation's website, she has managed XML processes for FDA-regulated content in 17 languages for a medical devices company, and created publishing workflows for importing XML into Adobe's FrameMaker and InDesign products. She has presented numerous times on XML and XSL for the IDEAlliance conferences (XML 2010, XML-in-Practice 2008, XML 2007), Society for Technical Communication and SUNY/Higher Ed groups."
