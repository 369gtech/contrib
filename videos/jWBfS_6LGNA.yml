title: 'Simplify Edge Architecture with Azure SQL Database Edge - BRK2014'
recordingDate: 1557191372
description: 'Running on Arm and x64 architecture with a reduced footprint, the proven performant and most secure Microsoft SQL engine is coming to the Edge in interactive devices and edge gateways. Combining new capabilities on data streaming and time-series, with in-database machine learning (ML) and graph, Azure SQL Database Edge is optimized for low-latency analytics right on the Edge. It provides local streaming, storage and ML for the needed autonomy on edge, while supports bi-directional movement on both data and machine learning models between the edge and cloud. It can be deployed and updated right from the enterprise/cloud portal e.g. Azure IoT for consistent security and turn-key management. Join us on Monday BRK2014 at 3:30 pm to know more!'
