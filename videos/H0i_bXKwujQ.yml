recordingDate: 1443353593
description: "The Stateless Service design principle has become ubiquitous in the tech industry for creating horizontally scalable services. However our applications do have state, we just have moved all of it to caches and databases. Today as applications are becoming more data intensive and request latencies are expected to be incredibly low, we’d like the benefits of stateful services, like data locality and sticky consistency. In this talk I will address the benefits of stateful services, how to build them so that they scale, and discuss projects from Halo and Twitter of highly distributed and scalable services that implement these techniques successfully.\n\nCaitie McCaffrey\nTWITTER\n@caitie\n\nCaitie McCaffrey is a Backend Brat and Distributed Systems Diva working on Infrastructure at Twitter.
