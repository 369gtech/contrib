title: 'GeeCON 2019: Jorrit van der Ven / Riccardo Lippolis - Kotlin is for hipsters'
recordingDate: 1563984001
description: 'Most developers like using cool, shiny, new technologies. But at the same time, we embrace the ''known'' older technology stacks when creating software which will run in production, and for good reason! At the Port of Rotterdam we decided to take a leap of faith and embrace our inner hipsters. Unhindered with any prior experience, we started developing our applications using Kotlin. In this talk, we will share our experiences with developing in Kotlin for a few months. Hopefully, we will enthuse you to make the same decision!'
