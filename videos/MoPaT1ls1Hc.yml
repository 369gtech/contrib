description: "JSLA Thursday June 28, 2012 - Andrew Cholakian @andrewvc\nD3 is perhaps the most powerful tool available for displaying realtime data on the web. By defining its own level of abstraction, being closer to the DOM than charting tools (e.g. highcharts), and being higher level than drawing primitives (e.g. Raphael), you can create\namazing data driven visualizations. This talk will cover the basics of D3, and best practices for integrating D3 visualizations with\nBackbone.js and realtime websocket data. An example of D3 + Backbone can be found in Andrew's open source Engulf HTTP load tester here github.com/andrewvc/engulf"
