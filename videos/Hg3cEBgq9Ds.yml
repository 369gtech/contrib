description: "Instill.io aims to provide the easiest way to create informative videos.\n\nIn this session, Mathieu Lorber and François Saulnier show how they built the front-end entirely with Dart and Polymer, with a modern Java back-end. They explain why they switched from Angular to Polymer, how they filled in the gaps between the two, and replaced Angular's router and scope. Mathieu Lorber and François Saulnier will show that not only is Dart's tooling mature enough, but popular tools from the JS ecosystem can also be integrated easily. In short, we will give our feedback about what it means to build a large, complex single-page Dart application for today's browsers. \n\nWatch more from the 2015 Dart Summit here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOU2XLYxmsIIQorIS8gagUiMau9S84vZV"
