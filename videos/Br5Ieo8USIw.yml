title: 'Plastic is Forever: Designing Tomu''s Injection-Molded Case'
recordingDate: 1548372401
description: "Sean \"xobs\" Cross\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/103/\n\nTomu is a small USB computer designed to fit entirely within a USB Type-A slot.  But how do you fit a small circuit board in a USB slot without having it fall out?  What exactly is the process of designing something to be made out of plastic?  What is open source injection molding?\r\n\r\nCome and hear what we learned while making the case for Tomu.  From reading mechanical diagrams to using open source software to actually getting it manufactured, we'll cover everything you've ever wanted to know about producing simple cases, what it takes to decide if your project should make the jump to plastic, and how to read the tea leaves when looking at injection molded parts.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
