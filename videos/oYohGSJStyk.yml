description: "Presenter: Scott Andrews\nNo longer are servers the exclusive holder of smarts, and clients dumb terminals. Modern application leverage the strengths of both the client and server to accomplish their tasks. No longer can a client side developer ignore the server, nor a server side developer ignore the client.\n\nThis talk will explore the interconnected world of clients and servers drawing inspiration from emerging frameworks that are pushing the limits of what's possible. We will look at the history of web development to uncover trends that inform future development paradigms. The strengths and weaknesses of each paradigm will be discussed in order to help determine the best fit for a project."
