The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nSponsored Keynote: Keep Kubernetes Caffeinated - Erin Boyd, Principal Software Engineer, Red Hat \n\nToday, we have a whole host of amazing coffee makers that can take a pod of coffee, brew it, deploy it into your cup, add the milk and sweetener, and deliver it just how you like it. In the same way, Kubernetes Operators are taking the complexity out of producing, deploying, and operating applications. One particular example of where Operators are making a big impact is Storage. Storage features in Kubernetes are evolving to solving more complex problems such as data replication and support for object storage. Come and see how the Rook project is extending these storage capabilities to deliver your applicationsâ€”just like your favorite cup of coffee. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UdPM"
