description: "No one knows how many programming languages there are in the world. New languages are born all the time, some to become really popular and widely used, some to occupy specific niches, and some to die slowly (or quickly). But for any language, what really makes it usable is having an adequate environment to work in. This session describes how to use the open source IntelliJ platform to build your own IDE and how to implement perfect support for a language from a single BNF file.\n\n\nAuthor:\nKonstantin Bulenkov\nKonstantin has been working at JetBrains as a Team Lead for over 6 years for now and during all this time he's been involved in the development of IntelliJ IDEA and all small IDEs based on it. He is the author of Darcula Look-n-Feel and a big number of UI components and features inside the IDE.\nView more trainings by Konstantin Bulenkov at https://www.parleys.com/author/konstantin-bulenkov\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
