description: "Building complex software projects is an iterative process. We rarely get to spend months designing and writing a complete project plan before releasing something to our users, and no feature is ever truly finished.\n\nIn this talk, I'll tell two true stories of building and refactoring applications using microservices as well as some of the lessons my teams learned during the process. You'll see how building your software with microservices can help ensure modularity and make incremental development easier."
