description: "Abstract: Softbank Payment Service (part of the Softbank Group) is developing a next-generation, in-house payment system using Spring and Pivotal Application Service.\n\nIn this session, we'll talk about how and why we introduced Pivotal Platform to the organization and provide an overview of the Spring Boot- and Spring Cloud-based architecture, as well as how we implemented CI/CD and designed for observability and high resilience. We'll also discuss the benefits introducing a platform has brought to both development and operations.\n\nThis system is now running in production. We'd like to share the things we've done to reduce incidents in production and make operations stable.\n\nSpeakers: Junya Suzuki, Software Engineer, SB Payment Service Corp; Daichi Kimura, SB Payment Service Corp\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2019\nSlideShare: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/a-journey-to-developing-inhouse-payment-system-cloud-native-development-with-spring-and-pivotal-platform"
