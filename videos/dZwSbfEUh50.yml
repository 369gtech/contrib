description: "I'm going to tell the audience about how sales are changing. From my day job as the CEO of a consulting company, I have a great view on how dozens of organizations and individuals are succeeding and failing in their go to market strategies. Three forces that drive the change I am going to talk about are:\n\n1. The shift in culture, media consumption, and consumers attention\n2. The shift in sales, marketing and customer success steam structure\n3. Automatisation of people and the rise of e-commerce as a discovery and buying pattern\n\nThe speech took place on 8th May 2019 on Marketing Stage during Infoshare 2019."
