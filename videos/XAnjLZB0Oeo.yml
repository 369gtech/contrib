description: "Practical Tips for Converging ITIL and DevOps with ElectricFlow and ServiceNow\n\nChris Fulton, Global Technical Account Manager, Electric Cloud\n\nWhile ITIL may have gotten a bad rep lately (for being too slow, or bureaucratic), there’s no denying it is essential – and deeply rooted – in the IT operations of many large-scale enterprises.\n\nITIL (fka Information Technology Infrastructure Library) has been around for a long time, and has helped large teams – particularly in industries that are heavily regulated – manage the way IT services are delivered in a predictable and consistent way.\n\n• Can ITIL and DevOps work together, towards a shared goal of quality releases, while ensuring governance, auditability, and mitigating the risk of failed releases?\n• How can teams who already subscribe to an ITIL way of working adopt DevOps practices?\n• How can ITIL processes for Incident management and Change Management be adapted to an Agile/DevOps way of thinking?\n\nOur customers show that the ITIL and DevOps are not mutually exclusive, and that they can work together – and deliver!\n\nThis talk focuses on processes and specific tooling and integrations for supporting the ITIL/DevOps hybrid in your organization:\n\n• How to bridge the gap between ITSM and Continuous Delivery in your team’s day-to-day processes?\n• How to automate the information gathering and data flow between your ITIL toolset – such as ServiceNow – and the DevOps Automation platforms – ElectricFlow. \n• Tips and best practices for meeting audit and security requirements, change management procedures, while speeding-up delivery – both for internal IT customers and end users. \n\nDOES16 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
