description: "Slides: https://www.slideshare.net/yiibu/the-emerging-global-web\n\nThe web was first conceived 25 years ago, by an Englishman. Fifteen years later, as the first crop of dot.coms were going bust, close to 60% of its users (and all Alexa \"top 20\" sites) came from developed nations. Fast forward to today, and the picture is strikingly different.\n\nAlmost half the Alexa \"top 20\" now comes from emerging economies. Economies where close to 3 billion people have yet to use the web, but thanks to mobile — won't have to wait much longer to discover it.\n\nThis presentation will introduce you to fascinating and innovative services that are re-shaping the web to serve the consumers of tomorrow. Driven by mobile, the power of personal relationships, and the breakneck pace of globalisation, these services provide a glimpse into the business models, opportunities and challenges we will face, when growing a truly global web.\n\nAbout Stephanie: https://stephanierieger.com/\nAbout Mobilism: https://mobilism.nl/\n\nVideography generously sponsored by Béyonit: https://www.beyonit.nl/"
