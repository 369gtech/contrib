Unfortunately, such software also had gigantic compile times of up to several days on parallel machines. And the syntax of template meta-programming can drive the toughest geeks into insanity. Despite this disillusion, the compiler support improved over the years and constexpr brought us a much simpler syntax. \n\nIn this light we like to ask the questions: What can, \nshould, and must we compute at compile time? Which new opportunities offer constexpr and their extension in C++14? What have to be done in the classical manner still? We will discover the different techniques of meta-programming with examples of simple examples, type information, expression templates and meta-tuning. Without becoming unbearably theoretical, we will show the equivalence of constexpr in C++11 and C++14 and their Turing completeness.\n— \nPeter Gottschling\nCEO, SimuNova\nPeter Gottschling is founder of SimuNova, a company that works on developing the Matrix Template Library (MTL4) and offers C++ training. He is a member of the ISO C++ standards committee, vice-chair of Germany s programming language standards committee, and founder of the C++ User Group in Dresden. He earned his Ph.D. in computer science at Technische Universitat Dresden in 2002.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
