However, well-chosen data structures and efficient algorithms applied to a web app is a key to performance. I want to show how to fit the knowledge you got at the university can solve your daily routines.\n\nVitalii is a Lead JavaScript Engineer with more than six years of professional experience. He is co-organizer of Angular Wroclaw meetup. Vitalii is keeping up-to-date with the latest Web Platform features and doing great experiments with it. This guy is not just a nerd, but tech speaker, ngGirls mentor, and the father of the excellent little girl."
