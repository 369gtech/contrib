description: "Authenticating to Google Data Services\r\nJeff Fisher, Jeff Scudder (Google), and Bing Yang (Salesforce.com)\r\n\r\nGet over that first hurdle in your prototype! Authenticating a user is a tricky, but necessary step for most applications that interact with Google services. This session will discuss the available authentication options, their limitations, and some advanced use cases such as Google Apps domains and signed requests.\r\n\r\nParticipants should be familiar with at least one GData API. Familiarity with public-key cryptography will be helpful, but is not required."
