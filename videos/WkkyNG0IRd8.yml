description: 'IT companies are addicted to exponential growth. But is this good for our planet, our society, and ourselves? Social entrepreneurship claims to offer an alternative - but something still doesn''t feel right. This talk will combine my practical experience building "nonprofit businesses" with the macroeconomic theory of "post-growth" economists like Tim Jackson and Kate Raworth. This talk will question everything that you know about entrepreneurship, provide practical tools to build something different, and then offer you a blue pill and a red pill. Can you go back to "business as usual" again?'
