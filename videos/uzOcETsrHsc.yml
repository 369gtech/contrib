description: "Network Virtualization in Multi-tenant Datacenters\n\nTeemu Koponen, Keith Amidon, Peter Balland, Mart√≠n Casado, Anupam Chanda, Bryan Fulton, Igor Ganichev, Jesse Gross, Natasha Gude, Paul Ingram, Ethan Jackson, Andrew Lambeth, Romain Lenglet, Shih-Hao Li, Amar Padmanabhan, Justin Pettit, Ben Pfaff, and Rajiv Ramanathan, VMware; Scott Shenker, International Computer Science Institute and the University of California, Berkeley; Alan Shieh, Jeremy Stribling, Pankaj Thakkar, Dan Wendlandt, Alexander Yip, and Ronghua Zhang, VMware\n\nMulti-tenant datacenters represent an extremely challenging networking environment. Tenants want the ability to migrate unmodified workloads from their enterprise networks to service provider datacenters, retaining the same networking configurations of their home network. The service providers must meet these needs without operator intervention while preserving their own operational flexibility and efficiency. Traditional networking approaches have failed to meet these tenant and provider requirements. Responding to this need, we present the design and implementation of a network virtualization solution for multi-tenant datacenters.\n\nView the full NSDI '14 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi14/technical-sessions"
