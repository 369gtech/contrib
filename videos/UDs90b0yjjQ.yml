description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2018\n—\nClass Template Argument Deduction (CTAD) is a very useful C++ language feature that was added in C++17. This talk is a comprehensive and practice-oriented introduction to this new technique. \n\nIn this talk I'll present how CATD and automatic deduction guides let you write cleaner and shorter code, show how to interact with it when using the C++ standard library and when designing your own classes, explain when and how user-defined deduction guides should be used, and cover the language rules behind all of this. \n\nWe will also discuss the various pitfalls that lie in wait: wrong and surprising template arguments being deduced, your constructor not being selected even if you think it should be, and automatic CTAD sometimes leading to unsafe and broken code – and how to circumnavigate those pitfalls.\n— \nTimur Doumler, JetBrains\n\nTimur Doumler works at JetBrains, where he develops the C++ frontend for CLion, the cross-platform C++ IDE. In the past he has spent much time working in the audio tech industry and has written code for the JUCE framework. Timur is an active member of the ISO C++ committee and passionate about clean code, good tools, and the evolution of the C++ language. He regularly speaks at conferences and enjoys C++ community work, currently serving as an organiser and program chair for the Audio Developer Conference and as moderator on includecpp.org.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
