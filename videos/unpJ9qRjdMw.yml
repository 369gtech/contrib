description: "RubyConf 2019 - The Fewer the Concepts, the Better the Code by David Copeland\n\nHow many people could change the code you wrote yesterday if they had to? I hope to convince you that the larger that number, the better your code, and the key is to manage conceptual overhead. The fewer things someone has to know to read and modify your code, the better for you, your team, your company, your app. We'll see real examples of code that we'll put on a conceptual diet. We'll then talk about what that reduction actually does to code quality.\n\n#confreaks #rubyconf2019"
