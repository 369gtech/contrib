description: "Open-sourcing is about more than just making code public. It's about creating welcoming environments where people feel empowered to participate, and using automation to minimize human bottlenecks.\r\n\r\nThe GitHub Flow methodology is a creative process whereby code is continuously\r\ncreated, tested, reviewed, and delivered to customers. This session will help you learn the best practices of how successful teams at GitHub apply the principles of the GitHub Flow to open source projects to make them more fun, welcoming, and scalable."
