No matter where it is running, managing the workloads within it remains the same thanks to standard APIs. But what if you want to change the size of the cluster itself?  In the cloud, Cluster Autoscaler can automatically shrink or expand Kubernetes clusters. To do this, it needs to reach beyond the cluster and interact with the environment where it’s running. It has built-in support for several clouds, but what if you’re running on a different one?   In this talk, we’ll walk through making cluster autoscaling work for a new cloud environment. We’ll start with the critical subset of functionality required for basic support and continue with enabling optional features. At the end, we’ll take a look at the future, and see how Cluster API will change all of this. \n\nTo learn more click here:  https://sched.co/FuJU"
