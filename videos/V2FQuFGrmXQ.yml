recordingDate: 1586888553
description: "Presenter: Boskey Savla \n\nHosting an app with Kubernetes is the path of least resistance, we don't need to understand how a given infrastructure/Cloud works.

These objects can be specified in text files along with a call to the Kubernetes API. However, we do need to learn what these objects are and how they can help us define application requirements. In this session we will take a look at Kuebrnetes, its objects and walkthrough a workflow of deploying and managing a Spring boot app with Kubernetes.\n\nLearn more about the VMware Tanzu portfolio here: https://cloud.vmware.com/tanzu"
