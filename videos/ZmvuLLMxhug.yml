title: '"SRE for Smaller Organisations" - Allan Shone (LCA 2020)'
recordingDate: 1578987058
description: "Allan Shone\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/142/\n\nThe Google Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) book is a wonderful collection of ideas and practices that ultimately are great if you work at Google. Like most people, however, you do not, so you need a slightly different set of ideas and principles to work by. Within the bounds of a smaller business, how can the principles put forward by the SRE moniker be applied on a much smaller scale? A handful of guiding principles can be taken, for instance, to give you, your team, and your business, a much easier time for achieving your goals.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n#linux.conf.au #linux #foss #opensource\n\nMon Jan 13 15:45:00 2020 at Arena"
