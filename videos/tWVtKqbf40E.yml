Multiple approaches to scalable concurrency are used in various programming languages: using OS threads, asynchronous programming styles (“reactive”), syntactic stackless coroutines (async/await), and user-mode threads (fibres). This talk will explore the problem, explain why Java has chosen user-mode threads to tackle it, and compare the various approaches and the tradeoffs they entail.\n\n• Follow us on social: \n  Website: https://codesync.global/conferences/code-mesh-ldn/\n  Twitter: https://twitter.com/CodeMeshIO\n\n• Looking for a unique learning experience?\n  Attend the next Code Sync conference near you! \n  See what's coming up at: https://codesync.global \n\n• SUBSCRIBE TO OUR CHANNEL\n  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC47eUBNO8KBH_V8AfowOWOw"
