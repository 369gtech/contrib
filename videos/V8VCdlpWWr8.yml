description: "Deep Dive: Helm - Matt Butcher & Adam Reese, Microsoft The Helm Deep Dive will have two parts.  \n\nThe first half will cover the status of Helm 3, with focus on the new security model, changes to charts, federated repositories, and the Helm core library. We will talk about the impact on the user but also cover the internal architecture.  The second half will be a working session where Helm maintainers and contributors can come together to discuss issues that benefit from face to face conversations.&nbsp; \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/Gre4"
