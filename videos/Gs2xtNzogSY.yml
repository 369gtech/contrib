description: "** Python Data Science Training: https://www.edureka.co/python **\nThis Edureka session on Introduction To Markov Chains will help you understand the basic idea behind Markov chains and how they can be modeled as a solution to real-world problems.\n\nHere’s a list of topics that will be covered in this session:\n\n1.       What Is A Markov Chain?\n2.       What Is The Markov Property?\n3.       Understanding Markov Chains With An Example\n4.       What Is A Transition Matrix?\n5.       Markov Chain In Python\n6.       Markov Chain Applications\n\nDo subscribe to our channel and hit the bell icon to never miss an update from us in the future: https://goo.gl/6ohpTV\n\nCheck out our Python Training Playlist: https://goo.gl/Na1p9G\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/edureka_learning/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/edurekaIN/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/edurekain\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/edureka\nSlideshare: https://www.slideshare.net/EdurekaIN/\n\n \nHow it Works?\n\n1. This is a 5 Week Instructor led Online Course,40 hours of assignment and 20 hours of project work\n\n2. We have a 24x7 One-on-One LIVE Technical Support to help you with any problems you might face or any clarifications you may require during the course.\n\n3. At the end of the training you will be working on a real time project for which we will provide you a Grade and a Verifiable Certificate!\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nAbout the Course\n\nEdureka’s Data Science Course on Python helps you gain expertise in various machine learning algorithms such as regression, clustering, decision trees, random forest, Naïve Bayes and Q-Learning. Throughout the Data Science Certification Course, you’ll be solving real life case studies on Media, Healthcare, Social Media, Aviation, HR.\n\nDuring our Python Certification Training, our instructors will help you to:\n\n \n\n1. Master the basic and advanced concepts of Python\n\n2. Gain insight into the 'Roles' played by a Machine Learning Engineer\n\n3. Automate data analysis using python\n\n \n\n4. Gain expertise in machine learning using Python and build a Real Life Machine Learning application\n\n \n\n5. Understand the supervised and unsupervised learning and concepts of Scikit-Learn\n\n \n\n6. Explain Time Series and it’s related concepts\n\n \n\n7. Perform Text Mining and Sentimental analysis\n\n \n\n8. Gain expertise to handle business in future, living the present\n\n9. Work on a Real Life Project on Big Data Analytics using Python and gain Hands on Project Experience\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nWhy learn Python?\n\n \n\nProgrammers love Python because of how fast and easy it is to use. Python cuts development time in half with its simple to read syntax and easy compilation feature. Debugging your programs is a breeze in Python with its built in debugger. Using Python makes Programmers more productive and their programs ultimately better. Python continues to be a favorite option for data scientists who use it for building and using Machine learning applications and other scientific computations.\n\nPython runs on Windows, Linux/Unix, Mac OS and has been ported to Java and .NET virtual machines. Python is free to use, even for the commercial products, because of its OSI-approved open source license.\n\nPython has evolved as the most preferred Language for Data Analytics and the increasing search trends on python also indicates that Python is the next \"Big Thing\" and a must for Professionals in the Data Analytics domain.\n\n \n\nPlease write back to us at sales@edureka.in or call us at IND: 9606058406 / US: 18338555775 (toll-free) for more information"
