Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nSecuring Your Services with Authentication, Authorization, and RBAC in gRPC - Luis Pabón, Portworx  \n\ngRPC makes it extremely simple to write complex, business-critical services, in a vast number of programming languages. Its simplicity and adaptability has made it simple for developers to adopt by easily generating code from structures and messages defined as protocol buffers. Writing a secure service based on gRPC, on the other hand, takes a little more effort. In this talk, we will be going through a model of how to secure a gRPC service using JWT based tokens to authenticate user access by relying on interceptors. We will also discuss models of how to provide role-based access control to authorize user access. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Uad3"
