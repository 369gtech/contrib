description: "My talk on “Yara Birkeland - a global game changer” touches on both Yara’s and Kongsberg’s motivation for delving into this project and why now is the right time to do this.\nI will also go into details on our development steps towards autonomy in a historical perspective leading up to what we perceive to be the essential components for unmanned vessels. At this point I will focus on the functional building blocks and how we incorporate these into a system and a software architecture, before I end the talk contemplating on future opportunities for autonomous functionality and how this will change the maritime industry.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences \nhttps://ndctechtown.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
