Each of those areas will first be described at the high level, followed up with deeper insight into concrete aspects and summarized with most recent achievements and a roadmap for future work. Time for Q&A will be reserved at the end of the session to understand how the SIG can better engage with the community as well as to allow the audience to provide the input about the roadmap. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UakV"
