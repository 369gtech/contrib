description: "I was just making another video but got an unexpected call from an alien world. In this video, I help a girl named North from another planet help find a missing device using Artificial Intelligence. We use machine learning/deep learning technologies to help find the device in the mountain of data. Using programming, we'll try to search for it. This video is made for the young and young at heart. \n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/Make_a_neural_network/blob/master/demo.py\n\nCoding challenge winners, i'll announce you guys in a separate video this weekend.
