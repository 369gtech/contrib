description: 'Over the past year and a half the ClojureScript community has collectively become the industry''s leading experts on building effective and compelling user experiences over immutable data. However, while immutability and functional programming dramatically reduce the complexity of client side code there is more work left to do, especially at the boundary between clients and servers. There are a growing set of technologies and ideas that can complete the story that deserve assessment. We''ll examine Relay (Facebook), JSONGraph (Netflix), and Datomic (Cognitect) and see how these technologies are guiding the design of the next version of Om, a popular React binding for ClojureScript.'
