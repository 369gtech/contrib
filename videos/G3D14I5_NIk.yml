description: "Armon Dadgar (@armon), HashiCorp CTO and co-founder, and Aaron Schlesinger (@arschles) walk us through the core concepts of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and how it goes beyond what people typically think when they hear “Infrastructure.” They break down the what, when, how, and why IaC makes developers’ lives easier, whether you’re running a simple application or have a complex, multi-node system.\n\nYou’ll learn how you can use HashiCorp Terraform to get up and running with IaC, going from nothing to a complete carbon copy of your production environment at the click of button (read: you focus on building, testing, and deploying, not spinning up test environments and hoping they’re close to what’s in production).\n\n00:58 What do we mean by infrastructure as code?\n02:45 Key value of infrastructure as code\n04:07 How does Terraform work?\n05:22 How do I get started with Terraform right now?\n\n\nLearn More:\nhttp://opensource.microsoft.com\n\nCreate a free Azure account:\nhttp://aka.ms/OpenSourceShow/18\n\nWatch Azure Friday ft HashiCorp Terraform:\nhttps://youtu.be/iECZMWIQfgc\n\nLearn more about HashiCorp Terraform:\nhttps://www.terraform.io\n\nCheck out HashiCorp Learn: \nhttps://learn.hashicorp.com/"
