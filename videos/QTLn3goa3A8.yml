description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2017\n—\nThe term \"Modern C++\" can be traced back to Andrei Alexandrescu's \"Modern C++ Design\", published in February 2001. Much has changed since then. Alexandrescu is off Dabbling in various things, Scott Meyers has retired; C++11 changed the landscape, then C++14, and now we are at C++17, with more on the way. \n\nClearly, we are now in the Postmodern C++ era. \n\nSo let's apply postmodernism to programming. YOU WON'T BELIEVE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT: \n- How to concentrate on one section of a programme at a time, and test in isolation. QA HATES HIM. \n- post-modern introspection?. IT WILL SHOCK YOU. \n- you'll NEVER BELIEVE what a postmodern smart ptr LOOKS LIKE! \n\nAlthough this is a lighthearted talk, it also aims to be insightful.\nIn fact, the goal is nothing less than to change the way you think about programming. \n— \nTony Van Eerd: Christie Digital, Ninja/Jedi/Tony\n\nTony has been coding for well over 25 years, and maybe coding well for some of that. Lots of pixel++, UX, threading, etc. Previously at Inscriber, Adobe, BlackBerry, he now enables Painting with Light at Christie. He is on the C++ Committee. He is a Ninja and a Jedi. Lock-free is a strange hobby. Follow @tvaneerd if you dare.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
