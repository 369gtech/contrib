description: "Privacy-preserving monitoring of an anonymity network Data Collection, Analysis, and Visualisation from the public Tor network\nby Iain Learmonth (irl)\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/UB2.252A/monitoring_anon.webm\n\n\nThe goals of a privacy and anonymity network like Tor are not easily combined with extensive data gathering, but at the same time data is needed for monitoring, understanding, and improving the network. The Tor Metrics team collects data and analyses the public Tor network. This talk will discuss safety principles that are followed, the tooling and workflows used, and also share some plans for future work to further enhance safety of data collection. \n\nRoom: UB2.252A (Lameere)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 13:50:00+01"
