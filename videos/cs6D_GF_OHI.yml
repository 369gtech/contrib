description: "❗️ATTENTION ❗️\nRegistration to 🚀DevTernity 2018 is running:\n✅ https://devternity.com\n\nSince 2003, the Open Web Application Security Project curates a list of the top ten security risks for web applications. The 2017 edition of the list proved to be a major challenge. Originally scheduled for 2016, a first release candidate came out in mid-2017, just to be retracted later. If all goes according to (the new) plan, the final version of the list will see the light of day a few days before the conference. What is still relevant in web application security, which attacks are getting rare, and which new threats are coming up on the horizon? Attend this session to find out!"
