description: "During this 3 hours university, you will learn some CDI basis, and will quickly dive into more advance CDI features (such as extension). Using JBoss Forge we will quickly generate a Java EE 7 web application, and then, following business requirements, we will add CDI functionalities.\n\nThis university talk will be a mixture of code and slides, focusing on CDI and Java EE 7."
