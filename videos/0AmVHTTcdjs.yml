title: 'Why Communities Matter by Sophie Koonin | Community Lounge | JSConf EU 2019'

description: "Sophie tells us about her three communities: the community I've formed through work, the community she’s met on Twitter, and the community she’s met in London at meetups such as React.JS Girls, London JS User Group and Node Girls. These communities have helped her fight impostor syndrome and land a dream job at Monzo in London, working with incredible people, as well as speaking at meetups and conferences. The community has helped her to understand what she’s worth, what she deserves from a job, and what she’s capable of. It's hugely spiriting to then be part of the community and help others do the same - seeing people from Node Girls getting their first developer jobs and giving talks about the things she’s learned so that others might do it too. She wants to share her story with as many people as possible. \n\nhttps://2019.jsconf.eu/community-lounge/"
