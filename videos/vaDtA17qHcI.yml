description: "Towards a Vendor Neutral Kubernetes - Andrew Kim, DigitalOcean \n\nWith over 50 Kubernetes Certified Platforms and Distributions, building Kubernetes with an open cloud philosophy has never been more important. This comes with a large set of technical and organizational challenges, from supporting the diverse range of features on the cloud (e.g. persistent volumes, load balancers, etc) to sustainably adding new providers into the ecosystem. In this session, Andrew, co-chair of SIG Cloud Provider, dives deep into what the community has been doing to move towards a vendor-neutral model with sustainability and portability as a top priority. He will discuss the migration of vendor-specific code out of Kubernetes core, architectural considerations of pluggable cloud provider features, the organizational challenges along the way, and the roadmap ahead. \n\nTo Learn More: https://sched.co/GrTl"
