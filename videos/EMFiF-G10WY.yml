description: "Amy Tobey, GitHub\n \nWhen Amy started at GitHub, support for SRE principles and technical solutions were well underway. What was missing was how to handle the human side: how can a group of individual contributors influence a company to prioritize reliability? To that end, she created the 1:1 SRE outreach and 1:1 incident debrief programs for the purpose of growing GitHub's culture of resilience by embracing the values of empathy and psychological safety. This talk will cover how the programs work, how they were launched, and real-world outcomes.\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
