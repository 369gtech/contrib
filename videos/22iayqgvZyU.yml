description: "From Copenhagen Business School\nMaster degree in Business Administration and Computer Science\n7 years Senior Developer at DtecNet Software\n3 years Scrum Master at DtecNet software\n1 year Technical Lead at MarkMonitor Copenhagen\n\nEffective scrum\n\nSupposedly agile methologies like Scrum and Kanban are currently very popular and often encouraged by developers, management and consultants from outside. It is often presented as an evolution or natural next step, while it may impose radical changes and actually prevent or hinder the goal of implementing the correct strategy for the company. This presentation is a review of the effects of implementation of scrum in an already agile software company. The aim of the presentation is to deliver the message that we should be careful with scrum and to provide the viewer with a perspective on team work as well as implementation strategies when dealing with Scrum. Covering: Scrum, Agile, Agile workers, team work, X-Y theory (McGregor) and more."
