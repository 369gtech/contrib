description: "Slides:https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/yet-another-k8s-installer\nAlthough Kubernetes has only been around for three years, there is no shortage in the number of deployment tools out there. Currently, there are over 60 installers supporting a wide variety of use cases. Everything from provisioning a development cluster on your laptop to standing up a production cluster in the cloud is available today. But wait, doesn't Cloud Foundry have a tool for deploying and managing distributed systems too? That's right, it's BOSH and it can deploy Kubernetes too. What sets BOSH apart from some of the other Kubernetes deployment providers is that it is not a new tool. BOSH users have been providing feedback on what it takes to manage complicated distributed systems for over 8 years now and it has strengthened the software into becoming a reliable tool for operators. Kubernetes is still maturing which means figuring out best deployment practices within BOSH and if it is indeed the right tool for the job. At this talk we'll compare BOSH to some of the other popular Kubernetes installers and see how it measures against the competition.\n\n\nSpeakers:\nUrvashi Reddy, Senior Software Engineer, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
