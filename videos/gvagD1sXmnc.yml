recordingDate: 1565264975
description: "Bazel is Googleâ€™s build system, known for being Fast and Correct - but less so on Macs.\nOn our journey to onboard Bazel at Wix, we had to build a development environment for Bazel on Macs, that would give all our developers an experience comparable to Bazel on Linux.\nWhat started out as a theoretically elegant solution, turned out to be an unexpected emotional roller coaster!\nIn this talk, Talya Gendley walks us through Build systems, what Bazel has to offer, and our journey of trying to build a solution that integrates many moving pieces and discuss some of the technical gotchas that she discovered.\nTalya also shares what it felt like to attempt a large scale research project, which affected hundreds of developers in her company, and the valuable life lessons she learned on addressing research projects."
