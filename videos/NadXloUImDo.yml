title: 'A teams transition to Continuous Delivery - Ashley Noble'
recordingDate: 1506326710
description: "Continuous Delivery is a popular term in Buzzword Bingo, but in this talk we'll look behind the curtain at how a small team in a large enterprise took a complex cloud based application that built and deployed in days, to building and deploying in an hour.\n\nWe'll look at the problems we faced and overcame, how we used automated acceptance tests to give us confidence in our deliveries, and what challenges we still have on our Continuous Delivery Journey."
