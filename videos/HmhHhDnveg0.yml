recordingDate: 1608314680
description: "I just built and setup a new, much more capable PC for some serious Deep Learning, Game Development (Unreal Engine + Unity), Gaming, Streaming, and maybe even some cryptocurrency mining :) I found a coveted Nvidia RTX 3080 GPU from a random computer hardware store nearby (OMG, only 1 left in stock!) I also bought a Ryzen 5 5600x CPU. In this week's game, we're going to re-build my new PC using several different components. I'm going to ask you 3 questions about computer architecture design, so i'm going to need you to start studying from my list of curated learning resources below. 3 Data Wizards will win $50 in BTC/ETH/USDC each this week, everyone on Earth is eligible, get hype!  \n\nAnswer live questions here:\nhttp://playcoderoyale.com/live\n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://gist.github.com/llSourcell/7c0d06ee611e62173a8af319d5e4c009\n\nSubscribe for more educational videos!
