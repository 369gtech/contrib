description: "Google Tech Talk\r\nApril 8, 2009\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nLooking for a way to reform house numbering in Japan I've discovered fundamental weak points on actual orientation tools. The main gap is - a simple answer to the simple question \"whereto?\"\r\n \r\nThe answer is mostly complex because there is no simple answer to the simple question \"where?\", e. g. where is Mountain View? Where is WTC tower 2 (dilemma on 9/11)?\r\n \r\nNames require maps, maps force to memorize a long chain of left-right commands.\r\n \r\nI've developed a natural orientation system which will simplify and harmonize indoor and outdoor signage, cartography, postal codes, navigation devices etc. This system was inspired by the orientation around the Christ statue in Rio de Janeiro and by the division of the horizon into 12 directions.\r\n \r\nThe basic proposal is to quantify this \"where\", simplifying the answer to \"whereto\". Finally, Google maps/earth could embed this new and much more natural orientation system and offer zoomable search grids and logical addresses.\r\n \r\nSpeaker: Henrique Köhler\r\n\r\n- born 1946 near Deggendorf, south east Germany\r\n- raised in S.
