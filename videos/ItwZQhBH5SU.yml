description: "by Michael Hausenblas\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/UD2.120/gocontainersorserverless.webm\n\n\nThis talk compares the approaches using a simple Go app, once implemented as containerized microservices and once as a serverless app and discusses advantages and limitations of each approach. Increasingly, we find deployments of Go in either a containerized setup (read: Kubernetes) or serverless (think: AWS Lambda). This talk compares the approaches using a simple Go app, once implemented as containerized microservices and once as a serverless app and discusses advantages and limitations of each approach. We will review the workflow end-to-end, and touch on topics like defining domain boundaries, communication, sharing state, observability, and costs, both in terms of learning curve and actual money. Parts of the app will be demoed live. \n\nRoom: UD2.120 (Chavanne)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 13:30:00+01"
