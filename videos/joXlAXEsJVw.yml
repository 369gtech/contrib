description: "\"SECRETS ARE LIES, SHARING IS CARING, PRIVACY IS THEFT.\" - A Dive into Privacy Preserving Machine Learning\n\nNahid Farhady Ghalaty and Vincent Pham, Capital One\n\nMachine Learning coupled with the new cloud and serverless technologies has enabled organizations to leverage big data analytics to create predictive and recommendation platforms at a larger scale for different applications. However, an often overlooked danger with all this exciting technology is the privacy of the data and privacy attacks on machine learning models.\n\nIn this talk, we identify and explore different points of leakage in machine learning models that can be exploited for privacy attacks such as attacks on training data, or model inversion attacks. Using the information on the attacks, we also propose the methods for model developers to protect their data and models. These methods are able to camouflage the main operations and computations of machine algorithms by injecting noise and dummy instructions in between. The key takeaway for the audience of this talk is to be able to learn and identify threats to the models they develop along with a demo of an attack and defense on a financial application.\n\nView the full OpML '20 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/opml20/program"
