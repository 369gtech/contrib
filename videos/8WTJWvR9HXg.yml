description: "Jutta Eckstein\n\nToday companies are expected to be flexible and both rapidly responsive and resilient to change, which basically asks them to be Agile. Yet, doing Agile (the mechanics) is different from being Agile (the mindset). The mindset lets you apply flexible Agile patterns not only for software development teams but for the whole company. Yet implementing company-wide Agility isn't straight forward, it asks for combining principles from Beyond Budgeting (adaptive budgeting), Open Space (leveraging the power of innovation from all employees), Sociocracy (flexible organizational structure that allows decentralized decision-making), and Agile (continuous learning via experiments and feedback). This combination provides company-wide agility.\n\nBy showing what such a combination can look like, Jutta will reveal a path toward company-wide agility.\n\nSave the date for NDC TechTown 2020  (31st of August - 3rd of September)\n\nCheck out more of our talks at: \nhttps://ndctechtown.com/\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/"
