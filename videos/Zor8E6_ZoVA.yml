description: 'We all know how amazing Webpack is, we have all heard it somewhere that we should start using it right now the problem usually is how to start. The configuration is not really self-explanatory and can sometimes get really confusing so in this talk I will walk us through getting Webpack set up as we can all make sense of the configuration and what little part does and be ready to start our own projects.'
