As our software gets larger and does more, that complexity resurfaces in new and less obvious ways. As much as the actor model is lauded for being like an organism, organic code can become full of structural complexity.\n\nIs there a way to strengthen our code, while retaining its flexibility and making it even clearer to communicate our intent? There is! The decades since, we've developed new techniques and patterns to structure our code. And best of all, we can have them encoded in libraries and modules directly! These techniques are starting to become enshrined in standard libraries of other languages â€” can they be brought to Elixir?\n\nSlides & full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/brooklyn-zelenka/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - BROOKLYN ZELENKA\n\nBrooklyn is the co-founder and chief scientist at FISSION, where her team is building next generation of web dev tools, levelling the playing field for teams of all sizes.\nShe is an Ethereum core developer, founded the Vancouver functional programming meetup, and is the author of several Elixir libraries including Exceptional, Quark, Algae, and Witchcraft. When not traveling on the conference circuit, she's based out of beautiful, rainy Vancouver.\n\nMore on Brooklyn Zelenka: https://codesync.global/speaker/brooklyn-zelenka/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM V 2020\nCode BEAM V is powered by Code Sync.
