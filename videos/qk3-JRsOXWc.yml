description: "Thomas Sprinkmeier\nhttp://linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/159/\nDid you know that symmetric ciphers don't produce palindromic ciphertext?  \r\nDid you know that \"Message Digest\" isn't what happens when you eat a secret note?  \r\nDid you know that Rainbow Tables can be used on sunny days?  \r\nDid you know that \"elliptic curves\" cannot be straightened by brute force?  \r\nDid you know that the birthday paradox has nothing to do with cake?  \r\nDid you know that hash collisions don't raise your insurance premiums?  \r\nDid you know that a \"zero knowledge proof\" isn't an entry requirement for the Church of Scientology?\r\n\r\nIf you answered \"Yes\" to all of the above then you'll probably want to go to a different talk.\r\n\r\nIf you answered \"wow, really?\" at least once then come along and get a brief introduction to cryptography and, time permitting, a quick tutorial that'll teach you just enough to be dangerous and maybe even a flame-war on the politics of cryptography."
