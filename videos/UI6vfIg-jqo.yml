description: "Video recording from AmsterdamJS Meetup https://www.meetup.com/AmsterdamJS/events/244906789/\n\nSpeculaas (https://github.com/mrijk/speculaas) is a Node.js version of clojure.spec. Using specifications makes it easy to generate tests for dynamic languages like Node.js. During this talk I will present the concepts behind specification based testing and demonstrate how this can be done using Speculaas."
