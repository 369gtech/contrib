description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM V 2020 - https://codesync.global/conferences/code-beam-sto/\n\nMore great virtual tech conferences - https://codesync.global \n\n---\n\n10s to 1000s engineers: scaling Erlang developer experience at WhatsApp\nby Anton Lavrik |\n\nABSTRACT\nHaving used Erlang at WhatsApp for 10 years, we know it works extremely well for a smaller team. But does Erlang scale to 100s and 1000s of engineers? In this talk, Anton will give an overview of what it takes to scale Erlang developer experience for rapidly growing engineering teams at a large tech company.\n\nAmong other things, Anton will talk about static typing, IDE integration, interoperability, structuring a large codebase, and build system.\nFinally, he'll discuss the current limitations of the Erlang ecosystem, and present our plans for addressing them.\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - Anton Lavrik\nAnton became fascinated by Erlang when he read Joe Armstrong's PhD thesis in 2004. Following the lucky encounter, he has been using Erlang professionally for over a decade. In 2019, Anton started WhatsApp Erlang team to work on the Erlang programming language.\n\n---\n\nCode BEAM V 2020 was sponsored by Duffel, PepsiCo, Klarna, WhatsApp, DNSimple, Flyiin, Erlang Solutions, Forza Football, BlockFi, App Unite, Pleroma, Simplabs, Telnyx, Clever Bunny, O'Reilly, Manning Publications\n\nCode BEAM V\nWebsite: https://codesync.global/conferences/code-beam-sto\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/CodeBEAMio"
