description: "Panel Discussion: GitOps & Best Practices for Cloud Native CI/CD - Allison Richardet, Asteris, LLC; Laura Tacho, CloudBees; Ivan Pedrazas, State Street; Tracy Miranda, CloudBees; and Alexis Richardson, Weaveworks \n\nCloud native technologies enable organisations to scale rapidly and deliver software much faster than before. To do this, organisations need to rethink their CI/CD systems and the best practices their teams use with Kubernetes. GitOps, operation by pull request, is a new paradigm and set of best practices for cloud native. But what does it mean and how can organisations go about adopting it for their CI/CD needs? This panel provides insights into GitOps, best practices for CI/CD for cloud native and tooling that can help automate these practices. It also features end user stories of their experiences learning the best ways to setup CI/CD for their specific applications and needs. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPYm"
