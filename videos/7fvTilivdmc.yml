language: English
recordingDate: 1629258573
description: "Deploying web services with modern cloud infrastructure presents its own well-known challenges. What new challenges arise when you introduce a new deployment target, literally one out of this world? Umbra takes a modern approach to software development and applies it to its satellite and ground software. In this talk, Chris Brown will review key parts of Umbra's software infrastructure, principles that guide their development workflow, and some lessons learned after the successful launch of Umbra's first satellite in June.\n\n\nhttps://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-Code-Supply/events/279945521"
