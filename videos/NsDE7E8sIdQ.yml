description: "(Recorded at Jfokus 2016. http://www.jfokus.com)\n\nFrom Concurrent to Parallel\n\nAs core counts continue to increase, how we exploit hardware parallelism in practice shifts from concurrency - using more cores to handle a bigger workload - to parallelism - using more cores to solve data-intensive problems faster. This talk will explore the different goals, tools, and techniques involved between these various approaches, and how to analyze a computation for potential parallelism, with specific attention to using the parallel stream library in Java SE 8.\n\nBrian Goetz, Oracle\n\nBrian Goetz is the Java Language Architect at Oracle, and was specification lead for JSR 335 (Lambda Expressions for the Java Language.) He is the author of the best-selling book \"Java Concurrency in Practice\" and is a frequent presenter at major industry conferences."
