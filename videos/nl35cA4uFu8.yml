description: "Domain-Driven Design Europe 2020\nhttp://dddeurope.com - https://twitter.com/ddd_eu\n\nSince Conway's Law was discovered in the sixties, we know that the organisation structure and the system design it produces, are closely linked. Bounded Contexts can help us create better team autonomy, resulting in more effective software designs.\n\nCyrille Martraire (@cyriux) is CTO and partner at Arolla (@ArollaFr), the founder of the Paris Software Craftsmanship community and a regular speaker at international conferences. With 17+ years of experience in startups, software vendors and banks, Cyrille still calls himself a developer. He's passionate about design in every aspect: TDD, BDD and in particular DDD.\n\nCyrille also has an extensive knowledge of capital market finance, and he's the author of the book Living Documentation to be published by Addison-Wesley Professional."
