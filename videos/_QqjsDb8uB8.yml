description: "The 11th ACM Symposium on Document Engineering\r\nMountain View, California, USA\r\nSeptember 19-22, 2011\r\n\r\nPaginate Dynamic and Web Content\r\nPresented by Fabio Giannetti\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nHighly customized and content driven documents present substantial challenges in producing sophisticated layout. In fact, these are apps that usually look like well-designed documents. A concrete example is e-books. E-books have re-flowing requirements to allow the user to read them on a plethora of devices as wells as change the font size and font style. Meanwhile this increases the flexibility of the medium, it loses common features found in books like footnotes, marginalia (a.k.a. side notes), pull-quotes and, floats. The proposed solution has the aim of providing an easy and flexible, yet powerful, way to express complex layout for highly dynamic and re-flowing content. To serve this purpose, a role based mapper has been introduced linking both flow and out-of-flow content."
