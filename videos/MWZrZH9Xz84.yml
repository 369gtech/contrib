description: "Filmed at http://2016.dotgo.eu on October 10th in Paris. More talks on http://thedotpost.com\n\nGo is a great general purpose programming language and it is thus no surprise it can be a great fit for science work. But Go could be an even better fit for all kind of exploratory work, such as data analysis, if it had an interactive interpreter, also known as a Read-Eval-Print Loop (a REPL). Sébastien introduces pygo, a very first step in that direction."
