description: "Speaker: Xing Yang\r\n\r\nAbstract:\r\n\r\nDifficulties in delivering monolith application lead software practitioners to move to microservice architecture. However many microservice projects simply repeated the mistakes made in the monolith applications, resulted in same poor quality deliveries with harder to diagnose issues.\r\n\r\nThis presentation proposes that microservices can be modelled as functions, where purity can be maintained by a) adopting CQRS concepts and modelling internal states as reduced over incoming commands; and b) pushing side effects towards system boundaries. With services as functions, a group of services working together therefore can be modelled as functional compositions.\r\n\r\nOrganizer: Flybot Pte Ltd\r\n\r\nSponsor: Thanks to Skyscanner for sponsoring venue & drinks and Flybot for the pizzas.\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/Singapore-Clojure-Meetup/events/257121444/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\r\nRecorded by: Ambrose\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/nTfm/"
