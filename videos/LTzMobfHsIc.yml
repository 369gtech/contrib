description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nLightning Talk: Machine Learning Observability with Prometheus - Shivay Lamba, Layer5\n\nEvaluating the metrics of a Machine Learning system is obviously a critical task during research & development phase. However, once a machine learning model is deployed in production, it is also critical to know how this model is performing. Having good instrumentation and observability practices is needed. Prometheus is a platform for monitoring application metrics and this lightning talk will share how you can use Prometheus to monitor ML Pipelines."
