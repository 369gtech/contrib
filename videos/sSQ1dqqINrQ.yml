title: 'Reinventing the REPL - Kovas Boguta'
recordingDate: 1359742921
description: 'As developers, we not only produce code, but also data. Session is a web-based REPL that brings Clojure''s principles to representing this process, allowing us to persist, query, and share our REPL-based computations. It also greatly extends the scope and utility of the REPL via a tagged-literal approach to UI. These capabilities address major pain-points of working with data, and amplify the power of the REPL for traditional use cases.'
