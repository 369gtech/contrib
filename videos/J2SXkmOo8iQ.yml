title: 'Pack to the Future: Cloud-Native Buildpacks on k8s'
language: English
recordingDate: 1571264258
description: "Are you a developer that would rather build features than maintain Dockerfiles? Is your organization excited about Kubernetes but worried about patching vulnerable dependencies across a great number of containers? In this talk, youâ€™ll learn how to use the pack CLI to go from source to image in seconds and patch a pod even faster. Cloud Foundry and Heroku users have long appreciated the developer experience and security guarantees provided by buildpacks. Cloud-Native Buildpacks (a CNCF sandbox project) represents a generational leap in buildpacks, bringing the power of buildpacks to k8s and beyond.\n\nSpeakers: Emily Casey, Principal Software Engineer, Pivotal; Joe Kutner, Java Language Owner, Heroku\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2019\nSlideshare: https://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/pack-to-the-future-cloudnative-buildpacks-on-k8s"
