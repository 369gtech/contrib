description: "Speaker: Eric Goodwin, Drupal Developer, PreviousNext\n\nKeeping your code well structured is critical for the longevity and maintainability of your project, but what about moving your logic outside of Drupal? It's easy to get lost in a world of Drupal, but sometimes the cleanest path is to move your logic into a separate library and only integrate with Drupal rather than building the entire thing in a drupal module. This talk discusses some of my experiences in moving specific functionality and data models outside of Drupal in an effort to build a cleaner, more testable architecture.\n\nAimed at people looking to take their first steps in building more isolated models and improving unit testing.\n\nEvent Page: https://www.drupalcamp.sg/\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\nRecorded by: Zion Ng"
