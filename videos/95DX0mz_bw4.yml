description: "A 186 year old turnaround story - inside a corporate reboot, and the power of cultural change\n\nFairfax media is a 186 year old media publisher and one of the largest in the Australian media landscape. Publishing household names such as Sydney Morning Herald, The Age & The Australian Financial Review.\nOver an intense period of 12 months, Fairfax re-platformed and re-oriented itself on a competitive footing. Reshaping it’s technology capability & product offerings ‘from scratch’, it started with incubating a new culture - taking the lessons of industry disruption and re-imaging the role that Technology, and a dynamic team culture plays in getting the right stuff done, quickly.\nWhat does it take to initiate a ‘180’ large scale culture change? What happens when you are considered ‘legacy’ and do disrupt yourself? Can a large business move swiftly, on startup timescales? Where are the traps? What is the collateral damage along the way? What mistakes were made and lessons learnt? Seeking a radical transformation in capability, Fairfax focused on getting its culture right - not just its technology. Discover the steps taken, and how we build up symbols, identity and purpose in a way that serves organisational goals and also just happens to be, by the way, be a great place to work.\n\nDamian is the CTO of Fairfax Metro, Australia's oldest and largest media publisher, with household mastheads such as the Sydney Morning Herald, The Age and the Australian Financial Review.\n\nDamian has spent over a decade in digital media, as founding CTO of Stan, the netflix competitor, as well as CTO of Ninemsn/Mi9.
