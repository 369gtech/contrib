description: "***** iOS Developer Training: https://www.edureka.co/ios-development *****\n\nObjective-C is the primary programming language you use when writing software for OS X and iOS. It’s a superset of the C programming language and provides object-oriented capabilities and a dynamic runtime. Objective-C inherits the syntax, primitive types, and flow control statements of C and adds syntax for defining classes and methods. It also adds language-level support for object graph management and object literals while providing dynamic typing and binding, deferring many responsibilities until runtime.\n\n\nRelated Blog : http://www.edureka.co/blog/ios-when-android-is-not-enough?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=objective_c\n\nWatch Sample Class recording: \nhttp://www.edureka.co/ios-development?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=objective_c\n\nEdureka iOS App Development course now includes Swift training.
