title: 'Drone CI vs Jenkins. Fight!- Niklas Hole, Ole Anders Stokker'
recordingDate: 1533113462
description: "Jenkins and Drone CI are similar in terms of functionality, but they are totally different in terms of architecture. Jenkins has existed for several years whereas Drone CI has not even passed version 1.0. As a result the two services have developed differently, with Drone CI being the more modern one and the one best fitted to the current standards set for build services. Jenkins on the other hand, due to being older, is based on standards that are currently not completely up to date.\nThis talk will go through what Jenkins and Drone CI is and compare them to other similar \nservices. By discussing their pros and cons through comparison, we can hopefully make it a bit easier to find the build service best suited for your needs."
