title: 'Building Event-Driven Microservices with Event Sourcing and CQRS - Lidan Hifi'
recordingDate: 1534323771
description: "Most systems today store only the current state of their business entities.\nHowever, you can look at the current state through a different lens, as a derivative of previous behaviors. Storing past behaviors as a sequence of events, instead of the current state of the entity, will gain you accurate audit logging, history revisions, flexible schemas and more. The current state is derived by replaying the events.\nEvent Sourcing is a great way to implement event-driven applications, and it’s often combined with CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) which is a key part of an architecture that is based on event sourcing. \n\n\nIn this talk, Lidan will cover the principles of Event Sourcing pattern, how to model your data accordingly and how you can improve your system by segregating reads and writes using specialized read models.\nYou’ll learn how these concepts fit in with event-driven microservices through a real-life example - an invoice management app we built at Wix."
