description: "Jim Mussared\n\nI have invested huge amounts of time in achieving a simple goal -- making the lighting in my home \"smart\". It's not ground breaking, nor is it practical or cost effective, but it sure was educational, uses a bunch of Python, and the result makes me (and my family) happy.\n\nhttps://2019.pycon-au.org/talks/its-dark-and-my-lights-arent-working-an-asyncio-success-story\n\nPyCon AU, the national Python Language conference, is on again this August in Sydney, at the International Convention Centre, Sydney, August 2 - 6 2019.\n\nVideo licence: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 - https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU\n\nSun Aug  4 11:50:00 2019 at C3.4 & C3.5"
