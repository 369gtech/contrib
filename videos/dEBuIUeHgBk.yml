description: "SREcon16 Europe - DNS: Old Solution for Modern Problems\n\nThomas Jackson and Rauf Guliyev, LinkedIn\n\nAs infrastructure becomes more complex, dynamic, and diverse service discovery becomes very important.\n\nThere are many solutions to this problem (thrift, rest.li, custom-zk, etc.) all of which require application changes which precludes the use of off-the-shelf software.\n\nWe have applications at LinkedIn where it isn't practical to integrate with our internal service discovery systems. After some thought we decided that all of these applications do support a common service discovery system: our old friend DNS.\n\nIn this presentation, we'll talk about how we implemented a distributed, highly available, eventually consistent service discovery system using DNS written in Go. We'll talk about the design, implementation, and challenges encountered on the way to production.\n\nView the full SREcon16 Europe Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon16europe/program"
