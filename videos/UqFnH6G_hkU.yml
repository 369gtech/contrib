description: "Big Bang rebuilds of systems are so 20th century - we no longer have the luxury of a complete system rebuild. In fact, a big bang migration of a monolithic architecture into a microservice architecture can be especially problematic, as we've explored in this talk.\n\nWe want to ship features, but we also want to improve our architecture, and for many of us, this means breaking down existing systems into microservices."
