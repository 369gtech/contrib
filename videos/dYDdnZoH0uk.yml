language: English
recordingDate: 1521249644
description: "Dependency graphs are a useful representation for exploring opportunities to introduce concurrency in a larger system. They are hidden all over computing (compilers, build systems) and everyday life (to-do lists, cooking recipes). Users can define a set of tasks, as well as dependencies between them, and wrek will execute the resulting graph as concurrently as possible.\n\nOBJECTIVES\n\nIntroduce/refamiliarize the audience with dependency graphs, explore the conception and design of wrek, showcase how wrek can be used and integrated into larger projects, demonstrate wrek's broad applicability.\n\nAUDIENCE\n\nDevelopers interested in seeing where mathematics and everyday life collide. Developers interested in new Erlang/OTP libraries.\n\nMore details on website: https://codesync.global/speaker/richard-kallos/"
