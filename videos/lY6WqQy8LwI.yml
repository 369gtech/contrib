description: "It seems everything today is now “Blockchain enabled”, but what attributes make up a good Blockchain project? Many companies fall into the same trap of thinking that “The Blockchain is a silver bullet”.\nIn this session I will draw on my experience working with customers over the past 2 years, and describe what works well on a Blockchain enabled project, and when you should “just use a database instead”. I’ll show you my criteria for deciding which projects I think are worth pursuing, and show the architecture of real projects I have built with customers.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcsydney.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
