description: "Filmed at https://2018.dotcss.io on November 8th in Paris. More talks on https://dotconferences.com/talks\n\nThe web is entering a new era of design opportunities with the introduction of CSS Grid, Photoshop like effects such as filters and blend modes and importantly the increasing support for Variable Fonts. \n\nVariable fonts can offer practical and creative opportunities for web design. We can combine them with pre-existing technologies to improve our font performance, design, accessibility and usability of our websites. We can also begin to explore new and exciting creative opportunities for story telling, design and expression in ways standard fonts could never provide us. \n\nThis is just the beginning of our journey to discover what we can do with variable fonts."
