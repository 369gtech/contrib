title: 'DrupalCon Baltimore 2017: Crucial Conversations: tools for handling difficult conversations'
recordingDate: 1493241657
description: "The worst part about communicating is that when you need to do it the best, we're often at our worst. \_Tensions rise, tempers flare and then it's far too easy to fixate on \"winning points\" than resolving anything effective. I want to share with you what I've learned about these conversations, how they can be diagnosed, debugged, and optimized. \_\n\nAnd also reveal to you how it's not usually what's happening on the other side of that kind of conversation that can be fixed. \_We'll talk about the things that are under your control: Your words and your body. \_And spolier alert: your body actively works against you at the precise moment you need everything to be working in harmony. \_We'll talk about a workflow you can walk through improve your recognition of when you or the other side are out of check and how you can walk a conversation back to constructive dialogue.\n\nThis talk is very important to me because with these tools I have been able to recognize how I've spent years avoiding problems rather that dealing with them. \_With these tools I have been able to recognize when I fall into that same trap, and work my way out of it."
