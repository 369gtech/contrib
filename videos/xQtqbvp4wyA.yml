title: 'The Three Software Stacks Required for IoT by Benjamin Cabé'
recordingDate: 1519830139
description: "Whether you’re looking at the constrained devices that make for the \"things\" of the IoT, gateways that connect them to the Internet, or backend servers, there’s a lot that one needs to build for creating end-to-end IoT solutions. In this session, we will look at the typical software features that are specific to IoT, and see what’s available in the open source ecosystem to implement them. We will also dive into the architecture of some real-world solutions that have been built on top of Eclipse IoT technologies, and learn about the software behind them.\n\nBenjamin Cabé, Eclipse Foundation\nBenjamin Cabé is an Internet of Things enthusiast and a Program Manager at the Eclipse Foundation, with years of experience in connecting things (and people!) together. He has been advocating the use of open source technologies to build Internet of Things solutions for many years and cofounded the Eclipse IoT Working Group in 2011. This working group has become a thriving community of 30 open source projects, hundreds of developers, and thousands of users who are creating together the open source technology needed for IoT. Benjamin is a speaker at many conferences worldwide (Devoxx, IoT World, Jfokus, EclipseCon, …) as well as an active producer of various kind of educational material around IoT that he shares on his blog: https://blog.benjamin-cabe.com.\n\nRecorded at Jfokus 2018\nhttps://www.jfokus.se/jfokus18/schedule.jsp"
