title: 'Making Data Science Notebook Collaborative  || Jan Matas'
language: English
recordingDate: 1616875093
description: "Jupyter notebook is now one of the most popular tools for data scientists, even though it is fairly difficult to work with it in a team setting. In this talk, we will first explore how notebooks work under the hood, then we will discuss how we can build collaboration features to enable real-time editing (like google docs) and finally we will address some security challenges inherent to having collaborative data science tools in the cloud.\n\n***\n\nZeet helps anyone deploy and scale like the top tech companies, without the work.
