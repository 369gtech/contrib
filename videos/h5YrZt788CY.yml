description: "\"Speaker: Faris Chebib\n\nAfter attending your local dev meetup for months, you suddenly get the dreaded email: \"\"Your Organizer just stepped down without nominating a replacement.\"\"\n\nBut the community relies on this meetup! It brings together devs from all around to engage in networking, learning, and comradery! So you step up. I mean, how hard could it be, right?\n\nOh no. This is much harder than you thought. You have to organize a venue, figure out refreshments, get a speaker, ensure people show up. \n\nIn this talk,  you'll learn the skills need to start and sustain a vibrant meetup and tech community.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2019 and https://github.com/PyCon/2019-slides\""
