title: 'YOW! Connected 2015 - Ben Teese - React Native: The Web Goes Native'
recordingDate: 1447506878
description: "Facebook’s React framework has taken the web development world by storm. Building on a model of lightweight components and one-way reactive data flow, it has proven itself as a way to build complex yet performant single-page applications.\n\nNow, recognising that the principles underlying React are not unique to the web, Facebook have released React Native, a framework for building native apps. In short, React Native gives you a native look-and-feel, but uses a Javascript-based component model. With an iOS version out since January and an Android version on the way, React Native aims to bring a “Learn Once, Write Anywhere” approach to native app development.\n\nIn this talk, we’ll start by discussing the fundamentals of React, specifically:\n\nThe concepts of the virtual DOM and render-tree diffing\nThe basics of the React component model\nThe benefits of one-way data flow\nThen we’ll go into how React Native translates these ideas into the native app development world. This will include:\n\nHow render-tree diffing works with native apps\nHow the React component model works with React Native\nHow React Native handles layout, styling and animation\nAlong the way, we’ll also see:\n\nThe benefits of React’s declarative component model\nHow React Native differs from other hybrid app technologies like Phonegap or Titanium\nHow Javascript’s inherently asynchronous nature makes it easier to write apps that are fluid and responsive\nThose coming from a native development background will leave this talk with an understanding of how the React programming model can make their app easier to comprehend and reason about. Those with a background in web development will learn how it will let them apply their skills to the world of native app development. Either way, this talk will be a great opportunity to learn about the revolutionary principles behind this exciting new framework.\n\nBen Teese is a senior software developer at Shine Technologies. He spent 10 years as a Java developer before moving onto Ruby and Javascript, with some excursions into iOS along the way.\n\nFor more on YOW! Connected, visit http://connected.yowconference.com.au"
