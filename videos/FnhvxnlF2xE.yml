But what does this mean? In this talk Garrett Smith will present the features of Erlang that were added specifically for improved reliability. He'll cover reliable principles in general, including isolation, fault detection and recovery, and state management. If you're new to Erlang or the principles of building reliable system, this talk will give you a great perspective for diving deeper into the topic!\n\nGarrett is a programmer at CloudBees, a leading Platform-as-a-Service vendor. He is responsible for platform operations where Erlang is used extensively for control, monitoring, and communication. He's a frequent speaker at software conferences including Goto, Codemotion, and OSCON. When not writing software, he's either drinking beer or creating talking bear videos like MongoDB Is Web Scale and Node.js Is Bad Add Rock Star tech.\n\nhttp://gar1t.com\n\n \nhttp://www.meetup.com/Lambda-Lounge-Krakow/events/123978522/\nhttp://www.meetup.com/Erlang-User-Group-Krakow/events/135081242/"
