title: 'GopherCon UK 2021: Riya Dattani & Chris James - Acceptance Tests, BDD & GO'
recordingDate: 1637596260
description: "The tests we write (or lack of) have an impact on the way we work with the systems we develop on every day. It goes beyond even the structure of your code, it can have an impact with how you work with the wider business too.\n\nIn this talk, Riya Dattani and Chris James will explain how BDD, when applied properly can help you write better, more useful software, in a more efficient and methodical way. They will show a practical example in a Go project, and show that you apply this practice with plain Go code, no frameworks required."
