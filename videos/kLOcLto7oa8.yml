It covers some of the core concepts of what WebAssembly is, what use cases it enables, and the basics of how to get started.\n\nThe Rust community has been rallying behind WebAssembly to make it runnable on the web as a top-tier language. The Rust team has created a set of tools to make the development of Rust WebAssembly easy.\n\nThe presentation discusses Rust and WebAssembly; the vision for where they are going; an introduction to the toolchain; and a deep dive into the implementation of some of the tools, such as wasm-bindgen.\n\nSendil Kumar\nUber\n\nRecorded at Jfokus 2020 in Stockholm 5th of february\nhttp://www.jfokus.se"
