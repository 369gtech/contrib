recordingDate: 1581972662
description: "The number of IoT devices is expected to be around 18 billion by 2022 and be a market of over $500 Billion. Edge computing is becoming an even bigger requirement. As a versatile language, JavaScript is in a great position to power many of these devices. This session will explore why and where JavaScript is being used in this industry segment and specifically the role that Node.JS plays in the Internet of Things.\n\n\nData collection in the IoT arena comes in fast and from a variety of sensors and devices. How to model that data is important for analysis downstream. Weâ€™ll also take a look at some different schema design patterns to think about when storing the data in a modern database, like MongoDB.\n\n\nEVENT:\nNodeJS Interactive 2019\n\n\nSPEAKER:\nJoe Karlsson, Mongo\n\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nThe Linux Foundation provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish NodeJS Interactive videos.\n\n\nCREDITS:\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=711Sb55fzdg"
