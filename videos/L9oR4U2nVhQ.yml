description: "Join us for our next conference: https://goo.gl/B2bqQ6\nEveryone is writing APIs from micro-services through to full applications, but what makes a good one? In this session we’ll look at five of the more important features that you should think about when creating an API. These are the features that ensure that your API plays well with HTTP and, more importantly, make your API a delight to maintain and work with. I want you to ensure that your API is a good HTTP citizen, while also providing developer-friendly features like thoughtful error handling and documentation. Give your API a competitive edge by making it sane so developers will want to work with it.\n\nAbout Rob Allen\n\nRob Allen is a software consultant and developer.
