description: "Video from Devoxx Poland 2019.\n\nWe’ve been using REST-based API development for over a decade now. While it provides a contract for both API developers and API consumers, it can be big, rigid and brittle. GraphQL can be used to either augment or replace REST based endpoints to provide faster and more flexible development. In this session, we’ll discuss GraphQL basics and look at how we create a GraphQL server and consume it in a client, using Java, of course!"
