description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2019 by Maria Neumayer, Deliveroo.\n\nMore info: http://androidmakers.fr/schedule/?sessionId=TWY-4180\n\nWorking with a design system can be hugely rewarding: layouts can be created and modified using shared components. This should result in faster development and consistent designs across the app. But getting there is a slow and painful process.\n\nWhen implementing a design system you have to make many decisions, like: Where do you start? What actually makes a component? And how flexible should components be? This talk will shed some light on these issues by taking you through Deliveroo's process of adopting the design system in its three Android apps.\n\nAlex Karp Production"
