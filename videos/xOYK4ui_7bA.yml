title: 'Prevent memory issues in iOS development with Swift—Milan Todorovic'
language: English
recordingDate: 1588058117
description: "In this lesson, I will explain how Swift creates objects, what exactly happens in memory during the program  execution and how Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) works. All this works great, but if you have a lot of objects with complex relations and maybe send references as input parameters to  closures, without taking care, you can experience memory leaking. You will be able to understand deeply, what is retain cycle and how to avoid it, how to write memory safe code and how to use the tools to watch memory usage and detect leaking.\n-----\n\nhttps://wearedevelopers.com/live\nConnect to WeAreDevelopers Live, the platform where you can see featured developers working and showcasing live.
