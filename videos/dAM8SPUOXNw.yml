description: "Filmed at https://2018.dotscale.io on June 1st in Paris. More talks on https://www.dotconferences.com/talks\n\nTechnology has gone through many iterations - Mainframes, to Client-Service Models, and now Isomorphic Applications. The world of Data Management has evolved too, from Databases, to Warehouses, Sharehouses, and Data Lakes, consequently Data Catalogues. Each of these iterations have given us learnings, and paved the way for better solutions! \n\nThe constantly changing data landscape has helped us look at new ways of solving problems, but at the same time, has also introduced new challenges. Preeti addresses the problem of picking the right Data Store, and elaborates on a four step Design Paradigm to help you pick the right one!"
