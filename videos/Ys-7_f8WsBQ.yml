title: 'Yukio Okuda - Basic Pitfalls in Wave form Analysis | PyData Global 2020'
language: English
recordingDate: 1609866572
description: "Talk \nThis talk focuses on the usual preparation steps of waveform analysis, digitizing, and converting to spectra. A simple python module DEEPS shows the errors of waves having frequencies lower than Nyquist frequencies, which is verified on an open dedicated dataset and YouTube sounds. The verification may improve domain-specific feature extractions of your analyses.\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
