description: "Apache Flink provides powerful stream processing capabilities which can allow organizations to move directly from batch to real time analytics, skipping the lambda architecture entirely. However, getting to production is not always as simple as rewriting your job in a new API, but requires rethinking your application design with a stream first mindset. This talk will cover MediaMath’s journey in rebuilding its reporting infrastructure using Apache Flink. We will discuss high level architectural designs when building an extensible reporting platform as well as deep dive into specific technical hurdles. Topics will include managing a Flink cluster on EC2 spot instances, reconciling Flink’s consistency model with S3’s, handling massive data skew as well as tools and techniques for building performant, fault tolerant streaming applications.\n\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://BashFilms.com"
