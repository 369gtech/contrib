description: "Tayloristic organisation is something we are used to see on most places. Common attributes of such organisations: sequential development, command and control, bureaucracy and focus on resources efficiency. \nWant to share an idea about alternative way to design organisation which better fits dynamic growth, agility and continuous improvement from my point of view. Will explain why decided to go this way and will share personal experience and lessons learned."
