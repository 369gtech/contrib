description: "Let’s take a look at some major recent and future language features in C#. In C# 8.0 we just shipped nullable reference types, which make the presence or absence of nulls a stated enforceable contract in the code.\n\nIn C# 9.0 we plan to introduce “record types” which help express plain old data more succinctly and with proper value semantics. And finally we’ll take a very early peek at some of our thoughts for the further-out future of C#.\n\nCheck out our links below, and don't miss our next conference!\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndccopenhagen.com/"
