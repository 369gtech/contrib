description: "Many developers are familiar with the powerful Chrome DevTools that help us inspect, profile, and debug our web applications. But, did you know that Chrome exposes virtually all the same information and capabilities via an API that you can use in JavaScript? \nIn this talk, we’ll look at how you can start using the Chrome DevTools Protocol today to unlock powerful automation techniques for your web application. We’ll cover how to start using the protocol through Puppeteer and then dive into some of the really exciting possibilities that have opened up when using this in conjunction with headless browsers, such as holistic application benchmarking, the collection of code usage metrics, and new testing paradigms.\n\n\nTrent Willis\nTrent Willis is a Senior UI Engineer at Netflix, where he builds tools and applications to give other engineers insight into their products.
