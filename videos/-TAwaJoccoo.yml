title: 'YOW! Data 2016 Quinton Anderson - Moving Forward Under the Weight of all that State'
recordingDate: 1478432666
description: "Keeping systems up to date is an inherently complex challenge. It is greatly complicated by integration challenges, organisational complexity and increasingly a massive amount of state. This talk will explore some of the drivers and patterns and present some approaches we are undertaking to address this problem in a sustainable manner.\n\nQuinton Anderson is a delivery focussed IT Leader and is currently the Head of Engineering â€“ Analytics and Information at Commonwealth Bank. I believe in building a team with the right people and then enabling them to succeed. I believe that a highly motivated and skilled team is vital to success and that my role in a management position is to create an environment in which this exists and then combine it with the appropriate processes, domain expertise and technology to create success. I find delivering IT projects extremely challenging and exciting. I believe that software systems should be engineered through quantitative and disciplined processes and that quality should be an absolute focus.\n\nFor more on YOW!
