description: "The cracks are showing, and they are deeper each time we meet. We are getting increasingly frustrated with how things are. Eventually we have ‘the talk’ and decide it is time to go our separate ways.\n\nWe’ve all been there, breakups are hard. Leaving a job to a new role is hard. Losing customers to another product is hard.\n\nThis talk will reveal the deep connection between relationship and user experience, and provide useful tools to develop a strong and happy bond.\n\nAbout the speaker:\nAnat Treanor is currently a UX Lead at Ocado Technology, building Ocado Smart Platform. Previously working with startups. Always learning. https://www.linkedin.com/in/anat-treanor-40266a4/\n\nAbout the conference:\nThe theme of The UX Conference on February 21st 2019 in London was collaboration between designers and marketers with speakers from LEGO, Canonical, Which?, Ocado, Monzo, Automattic, Condé Nast, Booking, Virgin Atlantic.
