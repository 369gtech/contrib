HolyJS 2016 Moscow\n11 ??????? 2016 ????\n\nMathias will talk about his latest project — fully open source, 100% P2P implementation of a modular \"dropbox\" written in Javascript. A shared folder where multiple people can share files with each other by simple dropping them, no matter how large. Mathias will tell about the technical aspects of this and make a bunch of demos. In addition, he'll show the implications of this for modern data science workflows."
