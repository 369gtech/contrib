description: 'Machine learning is gaining momentum with the increase of necessity to understand data much more efficiently, to predict better for competitive profit and research. In this talk we''ll run over various machine learning algorithms available in the Accord.NET - a framework for machine learning and scientific computing in .NET. We''ll also have a look at sample tasks to see how we can apply machine learning algorithms using Accord.NET framework with F# functional approach and C#.'
