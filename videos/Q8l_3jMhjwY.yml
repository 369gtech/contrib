description: "RubyConf 2018 - Yes, You Should Provide a Client Library For Your API by Daniel Azuma\n\nCongratulations! You’ve launched a RESTful JSON-based API, and now anyone can call your service by making HTTP requests. But is that enough? While HTTP-REST by itself can enable access to your service, an API client library can provide significant benefits in safety, security, readability, and ease of use. In this session, you’ll learn API client design patterns and best practices honed from releasing hundreds of APIs at Google, and you’ll discover tools that can take the tedium out of building, testing, and documenting your API clients for Ruby, and across other languages."
