They solve the discrepancy between writing code that is easy to maintain and writing code that loads efficiently in a browser. But there are advantages to bundling JavaScript code that go well beyond the browser, from cloud functions to servers to command line tools.\nRollupJS is special in that it was always designed from the ground up to be a general purpose bundler rather than a frontend specific tool. In this talk, we will have a look in what way other scenarios can profit from bundling. But more importantly, I will show you how RollupJS not only generates superior output in many situations, but how easy it is to tailor its output to custom requirements and non-standard scenarios. We will see how to patch up code, mock and replace dependencies, elegantly inject build information and control the chunk generation when code-splitting, all with a just few lines of code.\n\nThis event would not take place without the support of sponsors:\n\n🏆 🏆 🏆  Platinum Sponsors\nRollbar → https://rollbar.com/product/\nFocus Reactive → https://focusreactive.com/\n\n🏆 🏆  Gold Sponsors\nStackHawk → https://www.stackhawk.com/\nHarness → https://harness.io/\nBuddy → https://buddy.works/\nSonarSource → https://www.sonarsource.com/\nMicrosoft → https://aka.ms/devopsjsfm\nSentry → https://sentry.io\n\n🏆  Silver Sponsors\nMoogsoft → https://www.moogsoft.com/"
