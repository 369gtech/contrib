description: "Detecting Service Degradation and Failures at Scale through Distributed Log Processing\n\nYegya Narayanan and Veeramani Gandan, PayPal\n\nDetecting degradation and failures in distributed systems is a significantly complex problem, especially with 2000+ services running across multiple data centers. In this session, we will cover how the distributed log processing infrastructure in PayPal scales to process over 1PB of log volume per day and generate metrics to detect degradation in performance and failures in real time.\n\nView the full SREcon19 Asia/Pacific program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon19 Asia/Pacific/program\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
