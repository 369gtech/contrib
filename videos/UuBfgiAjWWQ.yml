description: "??ATTENTION ??\nRegistration to ?DevTernity 2018 is running:\n? https://devternity.com\n\nTDD introduced many improvements into development process, but the biggest impact relates to code design. Looking at the code from the usage perspective (by first writing an acceptance test) allows us to focus on usability rather than concrete implementation. Unfortunately usually we rest on laurels not trying to uplift this practice into architecture level. Consumer driven contracts are like TDD applied to API. Itâ€™s especially important in the world of microservices. Most people do not take into consideration plenty of potential obstacles that should be tackled when dealing with REST / Messaging communication. Then instead of frequent, fully automated deploys via delivery pipeline, you might end up in an asylum due to frequent mental breakdowns caused by production disasters. I'll show you a CDC implementation called Spring Cloud Contract Verifier. This presentation will depict how you can use the Stub Runner functionality in order to have a fully automated solution to stub your HTTP / Messaging collaborators. Just by adding proper configuration you'll be able to have all of your microservice's surrounding world faked with stubs that were tested against their producer. We'll write a system using the CDC approach together with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud. I'll show you how easy it is to write applications that have consumer driven API and that will allow a developer to speed up the time of writing his better quality software."
