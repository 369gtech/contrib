description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Chicago 2014\nhttp://gotochgo.com\n\nSimon Brown - Founder of \"Coding the Architecture\"\n\nABSTRACT\nSoftware architecture and coding are often seen as mutually exclusive disciplines, despite us referring to higher level abstractions when we talk about our software. You've probably heard others on your team talking about components, services and layers rather than objects when they're having discussions. Take a look at the codebase though. Can you clearly see these abstractions or does the code reflect some other structure? If so, why is there no clear mapping between the architecture and the code? Why do those architecture diagrams that you have on the wall say one thing whereas your code says another? In fact, why is it so hard to automatically generate a decent architecture diagram from an existing codebase? Join us to explore this topic further. \n\nLink to slides: http://gotocon.com/dl/goto-chicago-20...\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotochgo\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
