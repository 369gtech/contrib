Ближайшая конференция — DotNext\_2020 Piter\n15-18 июня, Online\nПодробности и билеты: https://bit.ly/dotnext2020piter\n\n. Один из основателей и CTO компании, которая делает Oz-Code.\n\nChatbots are a rising and exciting new way to interact with your users and engage them wherever they are. You most probably have a web site, you might have a mobile application, and if you're really serious (or bored) you might have a desktop application as well. But do you have a chatbot? Be it in Slack, Skype, Facebook or anywhere else — your users are already there, so why not allow them to interact with your service directly from there in a human, natural way?\n\nIn this session, you'll get to know the Microsoft Bot Framework and the Azure Bot Service, as we use them to build a real live .NET bot bartender on stage and tackle all of the development issues one by one. So, do you have a bot yet? Now is a great time!"
