description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nUsing Kubernetes with Data Processing Units to Offload Infrastructure - Thomas Phelan & Thomas Golway, HPE\n\nApplication architectures are shifting toward a more disaggregated model that offers greater agility, supports elasticity, and provides greater control for software quality assurance. This has led to an increase in complexity for application topologies, flows and security.\n\nIn this session, we will describe some novel work related to offloading core Kubernetes software infrastructure components from the main CPU onto the processing units of DPUs (data processing units). We will show a vendor-neutral way to not only offload the implementation of a Kubernetes CNI (container network interface) plugin, but also offload network packet tracing functionality, such as jaeger, and service mesh components, such as envoy.\n\nIn this session, you will learn about CNIs, SmartNICs, Arm CPUs, and how to run software somewhere other than the main CPU. You will also learn why this is becoming increasingly important in the quickly evolving world of DPUs."
