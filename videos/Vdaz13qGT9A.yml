description: "From the 2014 O'Reilly Velocity conference in Santa Clara, CA, join us for a snappy series of seven-minute talks on the main stage:\n\n1. How to Use WebPagetest to Guide Your Site Deployment Cycle (Kent Alstad)\nThis Lightning Demo is the story of how Radware integrated WebPagetest into our continuous integration system to guide R&D of new front-end optimization techniques. This session will demonstrate how WPT, as an accepted standard for measurement, can be automated to work with your site deployment cycle.\n\nWe have created an Amazon-based network for automating and testing sites with WebPagetest. This system is based on a node.js wrapper that automates WPT along with Amazon AMI automation that enables the user to select the pages (including flows), browsers, locations, bandwidth to setup tests that can compare various configuration scenarios. The system has grown to help customers understand site performance and acceleration value in the pre- and post-sales process.\n\nDuring the demo, we will see a script entered, AMI nodes launched, tests executed and then results available to compare two WPO treatments on a public web site.\n\n2. Find the Bad Performance Patterns using sitespeed.io (Peter Hedenskog)\nIn this lightning demo you will see how you can use sitespeed.io to get metrics and see patterns on your website that is bad for performance. The focus will be how to test for desktop and mobile, use multiple browsers and how this will help you see what to improve (and where to start). I will also show you how you can get the metrics using your continuous integration tool.\n\n3. Fiddler in 2014 (Eric Lawrence)\nThis Lightning Demo is packed with an exploration of the latest goodies in Fiddler. We'll focus on the latest functionality that you might have missed since Fiddler was first presented at the inaugural Velocity conference back in 2008. I'll show how Fiddler interoperates with other software including network sniffers, browser developer tools, and load testing frameworks. I'll show how Fiddler remains relevant in a mobile and multi-OS world, and give a quick summary of what's in store for future versions.\n\n\nAbout Kent Alstad (Radware Canada):\nKent is the Director of Acceleration Technologies at Radware in Vancouver, Canada. Before working at Radware Kent has been instrumental in authoring all of Strangeloop's issued and pending patents. Before helping create Strangeloop, he served as CTO at IronPoint Technology.

At daytime he works at Cybercom as tech lead/web performance consultant/handyman and at nights he improves sitespeed.io.\n\nPeter has been in the internet business since 1999, loves the full stack and runs the Stockholm Web Performance Group together with Per-Anders Rangsjö.\n\nAbout Eric Lawrence (Telerik):\nI'm passionate about building tools to help developers and testers build better web applications. I built the Fiddler Web Debugger and spent a dozen years at Microsoft working on the Office Online and Internet Explorer engineering teams.\n\nYou can read my content on Twitter @ericlaw and check out my Fiddler blog and IEInternals blog.\n\n\nWatch more from the 2014 Velocity Conference: http://goo.gl/JoMfvo\nFind out more about Velocity: http://velocityconf.com/\n\nDon't miss an upload!
