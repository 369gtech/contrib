description: "Instrument Flight Rules - Navigating Cyber Security in a Cloud Landscape\n\nThere was a time when protecting the perimeter was the primary means of defending your organisation’s digital assets. Keeping the firewall patched and managing and auditing the firewall ruleset was right at the top of the list of security priorities. Intrusion detection and prevention was all the rage. Today, more and more of our digital assets are moving out beyond the company borders. Flexible working means access from home, public wifi hotspots, airport lounges and now even from 30,000 feet above the oceans. VPN tunnels into the company was all that was required to enable remote access, but today key data resides outside of the company, rendering the VPN tunnel virtually useless.\nCloud technologies provides incredible agility and scale and the ability to roll out new products and services at a pace that was simply not achievable twenty years ago. Those that are not embracing these technologies risk being left behind in the ever more competing landscape. However, as with all new technologies, new challenges arise and cyber security in the new world is no different.\nIn this talk, we’ll look into the differences between cyber defence before and after the cloud. We’ll look into just how much of your data exists beyond the firewall, even for companies that believe they have not yet moved to the cloud. We’ll look at what can be done holistically to protect your data and discuss technologies that are specifically designed to address cloud security challenges.\n\nI am the CTO of Prospa, a fintech and Australia's #1 lender to small business, where I manage the engineering and cyber security teams.\n\nI have been working in commercial software engineering for 28 years with the past 19 years being exclusively in cloud based SaaS software.  I spent a few years doing cyber security consulting specifically on PKI and encryption technologies. \n\nI have lived through transitioning a company from on premise managing data centres across Sydney, Shanghai and Atlanta to the cloud.  I have spent the past three years in a company that is 100% cloud based and never owned a server.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
