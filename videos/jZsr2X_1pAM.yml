In this session, JP Gil and Wayne Piekarski discuss how to design and build for the new capabilities and opportunities that always-on screens provide.\n\nWatch more talks from Ubiquity Dev Summit here: https://goo.gl/FS9v3U\n\nSubscribe to the Google Developers channel at http://goo.gl/mQyv5L\n\nMusic by Terra Monk: http://www.terramonk.com"
