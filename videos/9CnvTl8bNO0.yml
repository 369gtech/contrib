Small, composable gears are composed to form beautiful complex structures; sounds familiar, doesn't it?\n\nIn this talk, we'll explore PureScript, get a computer to draw some spirographs, and see how functional programming makes the code almost as pretty as the end result.\n\nRead the full abstract: http://codesync.global/speaker/tom-harding/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - TOM HARDING\nLead Engineer (PureScript/Haskell)\n\nPureScript and Haskell Engineer at Habito, Idris enthusiast. Trying to overcome a very real fear of CSS.\n\nMore on Tom Harding: http://codesync.global/speaker/tom-harding/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE MESH LDN 18\nCode Mesh LDN is powered by Code Sync.
