recordingDate: 1581886427
description: "Tired of the business asking you question about your software that you don't know the answer to, let's get some visibility!\n\nJB talks about his journey from how he and his team evolved visibility in their systems, reduced those 3am calls, proposes throwing those overhead dashboards in the bin and looks to the future of how we could build self-monitoring software.\n\nContinuous Visibility is: “A set of processes and tools alongside a culture of designing systems to have a level of observability, monitoring and alerting to allow a development team to answer questions about a systems past, present and future state within acceptable time frames to the business”\n\nJames Brown\nThoughtWorks\n\nRecorded at Jfokus 2020 in Stockholm 4th of february\nhttp://www.jfokus.se"
