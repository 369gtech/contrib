title: 'Don’t Be Dilbert: Survival Tactics for Uninspiring Workplaces - Kylie Hunt'
recordingDate: 1475826983
description: "Let’s face it, the majority of work environments don’t exactly have us skipping on the way to work on a Monday morning. They’re just so… Dilbert. Managers who don’t understand what you do. Cookie-cutter. One-size-fits-all. But workplaces shouldn’t be where we go to work, they should be places we go to be inspired, to communicate, to be as productive as we possibly can be. A happy place.\nBut most workplaces aren’t happy places; most of us are not happy at work. I was one of those people with my very own Pointy Haired Boss and I want to help you do something about yours. This talk isn’t about turning your office into the Googleplex and now magically you’re in a fun workplace, but how you can influence your environment to help make you happier and more productive at work doing what you love. And who wouldn’t want to be happier at work?!"
