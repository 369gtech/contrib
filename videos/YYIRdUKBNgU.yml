language: English
recordingDate: 1557339858
description: "What if a Walmart engineer could write a letter to their past self, with all the lessons they learned in the first years of a massive digital transformation project? What if you could see it and ask questions? \r\n\r\nWe will focus the insights of this session on two key challenges: 1) Using multi-tenant and ASE application services in building cloud native applications and 2) networking & latency considerations when establishing secure private connections to on-premise resources. The Walmart team will share stories from the Finance data transformation projects and from the Digital Experience parts of their organization. The Azure App Service team will share the latest and greatest networking features in the product and coming soon."
