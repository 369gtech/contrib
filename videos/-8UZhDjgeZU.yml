description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2017\n—\nWe already have array, vector, and unordered_map, what other data structures could we possibly need? \n\nAs it turns out, there are a lot of them and they come from all areas of software! Curious to learn the latest method of representing a pathfinding search space in detailed 3D environments? Does efficiently detecting if a website could be malicious sound like an interesting problem to you? Perhaps understanding how AAA games store and track their entities so efficiently is more your speed? \n\nAll these things and more can be yours in exchange for just one hour of your time! Using that hour we will delve into some of the unique challenges faced by C++ developers in a variety of domains, and learn the inner workings of the creative solutions devised to solve them.\n— \nAllan Deutsch: DigiPen Institute of Technology, Student\n\nAllan Deutsch is a BSCS student at DigiPen Institute of Technology. \nHe has a passion for performance, an interest perfectly paired to C++ and game development. Allan completed a software engineering internship at Microsoft in 2016 and will be returning as a program manager intern in 2017 working with the Xbox Advanced Technology Group. He is currently working on proposals to the C++ Standards Committee for more efficient data structures, as well as the accompanying reference implementations. In his free time, Allan enjoys sailing, SCUBA diving, lifting weights, and organizing events.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
