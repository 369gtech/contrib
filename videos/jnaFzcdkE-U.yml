title: 'Berlin Buzzwords 2012: Nico Kruber - Scalable Web Applications with a Transactional Key Value Store'
recordingDate: 1545060522
description: "Modern web applications are commonly built on top of key-value stores for seamless horizontal scalability, e.g. in Cloud environments. In contrast to relational databases most key-value stores support only eventually consistency and a restricted data model (single index). Scalaris [1] is a scalable, transactional, distributed key-value store. It thus overcomes the consistency and data model restrictions of common key-value stores. Atomically updating a set of key-value pairs allows to map relational data models and multiple indices to the NoSQL paradigm. After a short introduction to Scalaris and the Wiki data model, we show how to map a Wiki (including backlinks, category pages, etc) to key-value pairs and how to use Scalaris as a storage backend. Several approaches to optimise such mappings with regard to scalability and performance will be presented and evaluated. \n\nMore Info: https://2012.berlinbuzzwords.de/sessions/scalaris-scalable-web-applications-transactional-key-value-store\n\nDescription of Nico Kruber:\nhttps://2012.berlinbuzzwords.de/content/nico-kruber"
