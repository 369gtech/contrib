description: "PyData Berlin 2018\n\nIn order to achieve optimal ranking algorithm in an e-commerce platform, a single algorithm might fall short in order to achieve the desired results. We compare and contrast, A/B testing and reinforcement learning based techniques in our search for optimal algorithm.\n\nSlides: https://github.com/kraktos/MAB\n---\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
