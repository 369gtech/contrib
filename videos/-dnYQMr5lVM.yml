description: "Sometimes code doesn’t run as fast as we’d like and we want to make it faster. Often these performance problems are noticed because user facing functions are unacceptability slow, and in a large system it may not be clear which of many components are responsible, so accurately profiling to identify the slow components is imperative. This talk will present the tools, techniques, and pitfalls I discovered while profiling a large clojure application.\nGregory has been a software engineer for about 6 years. Before discovering Clojure at this current gig at Capital One, he programmed at a small ecological modelling shop and at a high frequency trading firm. In his free time he brews beer, experiments with modernist cooking, and grows orchids."
