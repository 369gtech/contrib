description: "This workshop is about three things : team communication, project scoping and approaches to modelling. It is hands on, but doesn't involve coding. You will experience being part of an NLP project. In a team of 3 you will be assigned roles of an NLP engineer, an annotator or a business stakeholder. Your team will have a Game Master who will personally guide you through the journey, similar to D&D.\n\nYou will attempt to solve the business problem of analysing a homepage of a small business in order to classify it into a business category (bakery, cafe, deli etc ) and extract the business name and address. The NLP techniques used will be text classification and information extraction, however we will not run any code during the workshop. You will experience two modes of team communication and two approaches to modeling. You will try yourself in different team roles and learn the best practices of information flow, project scoping and NLP model building.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.
