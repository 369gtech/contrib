description: "Internet of Things that really matter\nFor business critical IoT applications in vehicles, the city and the industry, the solution has to satisfy tough requirements placed on security, robustness,\necosystem, and long-term availability. The inherent value of data in industrial, automotive, infrastructure applications is very high and therefore connectivity devices and networks have to be designed with security and robustness in mind. We also present how time and position can give higher value to the sensor data collected.\n\n\n\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry in the Malmö/Lund region. Foo Café is aimed at those interested in sharing, learning and creating. \nJoin the fun at foocafe.org"
