recordingDate: 1581434895
description: "Web developers today benefit from layers upon layers of technologies that they never even have to think about. Nor should they have to regularly think deeply about these things in their day jobs. However, understanding how a web request fundamentally works, from when a user hits “Go” in their browser to when individual electrons stream across the wires, can help one understand how and why the web operates in the nuanced ways that it does. In an approachable and user-friendly way, Chris will introduce and map out the network and electrical engineering that goes into making a single web request work.\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc\n\nSave 10% off any FITC event with discount code 'youtube'.\nSee our upcoming events at www.fitc.ca"
