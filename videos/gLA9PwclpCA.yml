In this presentation, Dennis will first introduce the overall design idea of the Rook and how it works, after that he will talk about how to deploy a Ceph cluster automatically with help of Rook and take use of it, including the volume provisioning and attachment, against a real workload on AArch64 server. At last, some new features(eg. CSI support), challenges and issues of this project will be discussed. \n\nTo learn more click here:\_ https://sched.co/FuKg"
