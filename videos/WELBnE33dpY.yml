Maybe testing reduces bugs, or maybe it's just superstition. If we want to improve our craft, we need a way to distinguish fact from fallacy. We need to look for evidence, placing our trust in hard data.\nEmpirical Software Engineering is the study of what actually works in programming. Instead of trusting our instincts we collect data, run studies, and peer-review our results. This talk is all about how we empirically find the facts in software and some of the challenges we face, with a particular [...]\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotochgo.com/2019/sessions/695\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOchgo\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttp://gotocon.com\nhttps://www.hillelwayne.com/talks/what-we-know-we-dont-know/\n#testing #QA #EmpiricalEngineering"
