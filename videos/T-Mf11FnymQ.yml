description: "You're an advanced user of Microsoft Office. You can create styles and edit field codes in Word, create formulas in Excel, and customize layouts in PowerPoint. You might even record macros and add them to your ribbon or Quick Access Toolbar. So, are you ready to take your work with Microsoft Office to the next level?\n\nIf you've not considered exploring Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) or Office Open XML, you might be surprised at both how easy they can be and how much you're missing. To put it another way: if you like saving time, simplifying tasks, and creating custom content, this webcast is for you.\n\nIn this webcast, get an introduction to both VBA and Office Open XML that's specifically intended for experienced Microsoft Office users. You'll get tips and see examples of how you can use both of these technologies for tasks ranging from timesavers, to troubleshooting, and customizing content beyond what you can do in the Microsoft Office programs.\n\nNote: To work with VBA or Office Open XML, you should be an advanced user of at least one Microsoft Office program that utilizes those technologiesâ€”but you absolutely don't have to be a programmer.\n\nAbout Stephanie Krieger:\n\nStephanie Krieger is a Microsoft Office MVP and the author of three books on Microsoft Office document production, including the recently-released Documents, Presentations, and Workbooks for Office 2010 and Office for Mac 2011.
