title: '[VDT18] RESTEasy beyond JAX-RS 2.1: reactive, non-blocking IO and more by Alessio Soldano'
language: English
recordingDate: 1540659028
description: 'Last year, JAX-RS 2.1 (JSR-370) brought few fresh additions to the Java API for REST services. Today RESTEasy, which is the Red Hat / JBoss certified implementation of JAX-RS, moves even forward and fully embrace reactive programming. The presentation will provide an overwiew (with code examples) of reactive additions on both client and server side; it will also cover few other new features around asynchronous processing and non-blocking I/O.'
