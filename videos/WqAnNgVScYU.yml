description: "Speaker: Hari Krishnan\n\nDescription\nWhere does Python fit in when it comes to MicroServices architecture? This talk will be about sharing my learnings as a Polyglot Developer about which languages suit best to build different types of MicroServices. With examples and real world scenarios I hope to make this session an introduction to MicroServices architecture from a Python Developer's point of view.\n\nAbstract\nBelow are some of the rough high level areas I plan to talk about.\n\nWhat is MicroServices architecture and why should I care as a Python Developer?\nHow does Python fit in?\nExample: how to build an all Python Microservices application\nDoes it make sense to use Python everywhere?\nGetting Python to talk to other languages a. Communication - HTTP b. Message Queues c. Unified Logging\nPerformance\nScaling a Python MicroService\nLibraries that can help\nMonitoring a MicroServices Application\n\nEvent Page: https://pycon.sg\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/P6Rp/"
