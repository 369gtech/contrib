title: 'Claudio Freire - Efficient shared memory data structures - PyCon 2018'
recordingDate: 1526253581
description: "Speaker: Claudio Freire\n\nMultithreading makes shared memory easy, but true parallelism next to impossible. Multiprocessing gives us true parallelism, but it makes sharing memory very difficult, and high overhead. In this talk, we'll explore techniques to share memory between processes efficiently, with a focus on sharing read-only massive data structures.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2018 and https://github.com/PyCon/2018-slides"
