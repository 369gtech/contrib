title: 'Real Time UI with Apache Kafka Streaming Analytics of Fast Data and Server Push'
language: English
recordingDate: 1526548676
description: "with Lucas Jellema\n\nFast data arrives in real time and potentially high volume. Rapid processing, filtering and aggregation is required to ensure timely reaction and actual information in user interfaces. Doing so is a challenge, make this happen in a scalable and reliable fashion is even more interesting. This session introduces Apache Kafka as the scalable event bus that takes care of the events as they flow in and Kafka Streams for the streaming analytics. Both Java and Node applications are demonstrated that interact with Kafka and leverage Server Sent Events and WebSocket channels to update the Web UI in real time. User activity performed by the audience in the Web UI is processed by the Kafka powered back end and results in live updates on all clients. Kafka Streams and KSQL are used to analyze the real time events in real time and publish events with the live findings."
