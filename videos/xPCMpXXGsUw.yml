title: 'Building a Reactive DB Driver with R2DBC (Igor Lozynskyi, Ukraine) [UA]'

description: "https://jeeconf.com/program/building-a-reactive-db-driver-with-r2dbc/\n\nReactive programming is popular nowadays. RxJava and Project Reactor made reactive programming an everyday routine. Spring Framework brought Spring WebFlux for high-performance web-applications and Spring Cloud for reactive messaging solutions. Now, we are tackling the last frontier where blocking approaches are still winning: database access. During this talk, we are going to implement our own toy reactive database driver (R2DBC-complaint) and use it for accessing data via Reactive Spring Data."
