description: "Managing APIs and Contracts in a Microservices World Using Spring Cloud Contract [I] - Bjorn Boe, Pivotal    \n\nWith the rise of microservices and the fall of the monolith, new challenges arise. The monolith that used to be contained in one large codebase have been split up and is being managed by multiple teams. These teams still depend on each other to deliver the final solution, but may not have exactly the same understanding of the APIs that tie the solution together. This situation leads to a lot of time being spent fixing integration problems late in the development cycle and complicates the ability to fully automate the software deployment lifecycle.\n\nIn this presentation, Bjorn will look at how Spring Cloud Contract can be used to address this problem. He will show how Spring Cloud Contract can be used to define consumer driven contracts that can be used as server stubs for the client and as unit tests for the server.\n\nAfter this presentation, the audience will know how Spring Cloud Contract can be used to help them deliver successful microservices at scale.\n\nBjorn Boe\nPlatform Architect, Pivotal\nBjorn works as a Platform Architect at Pivotal, helping customers build applications natively for the cloud, using technologies like Spring and Cloud Foundry."
