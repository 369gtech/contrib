title: 'Introduction to PASETO (platform-agnostic security tokens) - Ruby Jane Cabagnot'
language: English
recordingDate: 1605696411
description: "JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) have become ubiquitous in the web authentication landscape over the last four years. In this talk, I'll introduce you to their successor: PASETO tokens (platform agnostic security tokens).\nUnlike JSON Web Tokens (JWT), which gives developers more than enough rope with which to hang themselves, PASETO only allows secure operations. JWT gives you \"algorithm agility\", PASETO gives you \"versioned protocols\". It's incredibly unlikely that you'll be able to use Paseto in an insecure way.\n\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks at: \nhttps://ndcsydney.com\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/"
