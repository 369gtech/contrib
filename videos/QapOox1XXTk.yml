Ruter, Norway’s largest public transport authority, is putting significant effort into improving digital services for customers.  However, the current technology stack behind Ruter's operations, is not able to provide the necessary real-time information.\n\nIn this talk I will explain how Ruter is participating in the development of new European standards for information technology for public transport (ITxPT), and how Apache Kafka and Kafka streams serve as the core components in building \"Transport-as-a-Service\"."
