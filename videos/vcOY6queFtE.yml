recordingDate: 1520945250
description: "When the time comes to say the price you want, or to negotiate on your terms, what happens to you? Are you comfortable? Maybe you're moving uncomfortably in your chair? Maybe you're avoiding it all? Or prefer to maintain a good relationship even at the cost of a financial loss?\n\nTo maximize resources and maintain good relationships, you need to know how to do it right.\nWe are operating in a new business climate where negotiation skills are needed more than ever. Remember, you do not get what you think you're worth, you get what you can achieve in negotiation.\n\nMaya Miller - https://www.linkedin.com/in/mayamiller/"
