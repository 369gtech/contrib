description: 'In the day and age of frameworks, transpilers and build systems most developers new to JavaScript spend more time understanding these tools than the language itself. The powerful fundamentals of JavaScript — and the even more powerful recent additions — are lost when there''s a library for everything. This talk aims to explore some of the useful and sometimes strange sides of the language. We''ll talk about higher order functions, the object model and meta programming (traditional as well as modern). We will dive into the language itself and rediscover its forgotten funky functions.'
