description: "Implementing Event-Driven Microservices Architecture using Functional programming - Nikhil Barthwal (Lambda Days 2017)\n\nhttp://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2017\n\nWeb services are typically stateless entities, that need to operate at scale at large. Functional paradigm can be used to model these web services work and offer several benefits like scalability, productivity and correctness.\n\nIn this talk, I describe how to implement an Event-Driven Microservices Architecture using Functional Programing language, and demonstrate how various characteristics of functional paradigm capture the behavior of such services architecture very naturally.\n\nI have included some real-life examples from Jet.com."
