recordingDate: 1530178499
description: "\"Should designers code?\" or \"Should coders design?\" â€” these 2 eternal questions are being asked for years with no particular answer given.\n\nHow to let developers know what typography style or button variance they should be using on this particular screen?\nHow to ensure that the whole UI is consistent?\nHow to let designers know that some screen design doesn't fit the requirements and needs to be updated?\nIn order to answer those questions designers and developers have to speak the same language. But what language should it be. UI components and pattern libraries can provide this intermediate abstraction and be a common language for both designers and developers.\n\nDuring this talk, I'll guide you through some frustrations I've experienced as a designer and as a developer when working on different projects. I'll show how the common UI patterns library can solve some of these problems and improve the overall productivity of the team."
