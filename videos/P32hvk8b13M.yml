description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2016\n—\nThis talk starts very simple: with seconds. It explains exactly what a second is: what is under the hood, what it can do, and most importantly how and why it fails at compile time. Failing at compile time, instead of at run time is the critical design philosophy that runs through chrono.\n\nSlowly the talk adds complexity: other units of time duration, custom time durations, conversions among durations, points in time, etc. With each addition, another layer of the chrono onion is peeled away.\n\nBy the end of the talk, you will understand both the importance of the simplicity of chrono, and the power available to you if you avoid the typical mistakes beginners make when first learning chrono. Even experts will find at least one undiscovered gem in this talk to take back to their own code. And you may see ways to transfer some of the chrono design principles into your own designs.\n\nPeople who attend this talk will be especially well prepared for my later talk about time zones.\n\nThis talk is a prequel to my CppCon 2015 talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzyGjOm8AKo\n— \nHoward Hinnant\nSenior Software Engineer, Ripple\nLead author of several C++11 features including: move semantics, unique_ptr and . | | Lead author on three open source projects: A std::lib implementation: http://libcxx.llvm.org | An Itanium ABI implementation: http://libcxxabi.llvm.org | A date/time/timezone library: https://github.com/HowardHinnant/date\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
