description: "Google Tech Talk\r\nApril 23, 2010\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nPresented by Daniel A. Nagy.\r\n\r\nSince the early days of the Web, the holy grail of charging viewers for content has eluded developers and publishers alike. All of the implemented solutions have very serious shortcomings, of which users hating them is one of the most pervasive. In the presentation, the reasons of this failure are explored and a somewhat novel approach is demonstrated where economics sets the goals for engineering. The talk focuses on issues such as\r\n - Micropayment\r\n - Mental accounting and associated costs\r\n - User experience and interface design\r\n\r\nDaniel A. Nagy is an information security researcher interested in the application of economics-based designs to real-life problems of telecommunication security. His background is Telecommunications Engineering (MS) and Applied Mathematics (PhD). His home page is: https://www.epointsystem.org/~nagydani/homepage"
