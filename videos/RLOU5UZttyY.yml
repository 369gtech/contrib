description: "Linux containers started becoming popular with developers in 2008. Windows containers first became a real concept in 2015 (with the release of Windows Server 2016). But with Windows Server 2019, the Windows container ecosystem has rapidly caught up, and is now a first-class citizen within Kubernetes.\n\nEnterprise PKS offers developers and platform teams a secure and scalable container-based platform enabling you to build a strategy to move your application workloads from the virtual world to the container world.\n\nIn this session, you'll learn how to design and deploy Windows containers on Enterprise PKS. Hear from Pivotal and VMware representatives about how utilizing a single set of tools to manage a heterogeneous Kubernetes environment will increase your operational efficiency and decrease recurring infrastructure and management costs.\n\nWe'll provide examples of how customers have achieved key business outcomes by moving their .NET and Windows workloads to Enterprise PKS.\n\nSpeakers: Kartik Lunkad, Staff Product Manager, Pivotal; Michael Michael, Director of Product Management, VMware\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform\nSlideshare: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/kubernetes-and-windows-at-scale-with-enterprise-pks-183707646"
