description: "You’ve heard about it. Maybe you’re even using a language such as JRuby that uses it. But what exactly is invokedynamic, and how can it help you as a Java developer? This session covers the basics of what invokedynamic is and how you can use it.\nYou’ll learn how the new Method Handle API gives you reflective access with better performance and more flexibility. The presentation steps through some simple examples to show the mechanics of the invokedynamic bytecode and bootstrap process. And finally you’ll experience how a toy language is built and see how it all fits together. The invokedynamic instruction is the most important change to the JVM in its history. Come find out why.\n\n\nAuthor:\nCharles Nutter\nCharles has been programming most of his life, as a Java developer for the past decade and as a JRuby developer for over six years. He co-leads the JRuby project, an effort to bring the beauty of Ruby and the power of the JVM together. Charles believes in open source and open standards and hopes his efforts on JRuby and other languages will ensure the JVM remains the preferred open-source managed runtime for many years to come.\nView more trainings by Charles Nutter at https://www.parleys.com/author/charles-nutter-4\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
