title: 'Webinar: GitOps Continuous Delivery with Argo and Codefresh'
language: English
recordingDate: 1596120081
description: "Never make a manual change again. In this talk we’ll show how to use GitOps to achieve reliable, and fast releases time and time again. Rather than pushing changes, Argo pulls and syncs code changes to a cluster. When combined with Codefresh’s CI/CD components we can get something magical.\n\nPresented by:\n\nBrandon Phillips, Solutions Architect\_@Codefresh"
