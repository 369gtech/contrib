description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io\_The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nIntro: Apache Kafka on Kubernetes with Strimzi - Jakub Scholz & Paolo Patierno, Red Hat \n\nStrimzi is a CNCF project focusing on running Apache Kafka on Kubernetes. Apache Kafka has emerged as a leading platform for building real-time data pipelines. It provides support for high-throughput/low-latency messaging, as well as sophisticated development options that cover all the stages of a distributed data streaming pipeline, from ingestion to processing. But running it on Kubernetes can be complex and tedious. This talk will introduce you to Strimzi - an operator which makes it easy to run Apache Kafka on Kubernetes. It addresses the whole lifecycle from creating, managing, and monitoring Kafka clusters to managing topics or users. This session will go through the main challenges of running Apache Kafka on Kubernetes, explain how they are solved by Strimzi and show a demo. \n\nhttps://sched.co/cpBW"
