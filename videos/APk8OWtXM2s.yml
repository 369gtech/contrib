description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2014\nSpeakers: Roy Clarkson, Greg Turnquist\nhttp://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/spring-one2gx-2014widedatameetshypermedia\nSpring Data REST bridges the gap between the convenient data access layers provided by Spring Data's repository abstraction and hypermedia-driven REST web services, effectively taking out the boilerplate needed during implementation. This talk will give a quick overview of the project, explain fundamental design decisions and introduce new features of the latest version (namely service documentation and discoverability).\nWe will then look at the Spring-A-Gram sample application (built using Spring Data REST), focusing on the implementation of the frontend bits and pieces."
