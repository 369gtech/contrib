description: "The sad truth is that even companies that wish to have accessible websites often only dedicate the time and effort to create SOME accessibility. What they choose to make accessible is often based on what a handful of people, often abled bodied ones, decide, and doesnâ€™t always reflect what users want or need.\n\nUsing a series of surveys and discussions with other disabled people, I have synthesized suggestions and examples of what makes the most impact for many users or gigantic impacts on usage for smaller groups.We'll go over the look, feel, and functionality of websites and some basic design changes that can be used to great benefit.\n\nResources: https://dragun.tech/jsconfhawaii/\n\nSlides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XdnqnAhCQntSkmmGge6-Ibngo9Dl6J_ptOY9ZpnJ9lY/edit?usp=sharing\n\nJSConf Hawaii will return soon\nhttps://www.jsconfhi.com/"
