recordingDate: 1532049372
description: "The first half of this low-key talk is about how servers are run in the cloud with hypervisors like Xen. Our presenter will cover what hypervisors are and a brief historical persective on virtual machines. There will even be a slide or two about Kubernetes.\n\nAfter that, we'll dig into the main topic: introducing our presenter's favorite operating system, QubesOS. The one Edward Snowden said \"is the best OS available today\". We'll discuss how to install it, its architecture, the philosophy behind its development, using QubesOS to browse the web, write code, chat with friends, etc, along with the benefits and drawbacks of using hypervisors for personal computing.\n\nSeamus to present."
