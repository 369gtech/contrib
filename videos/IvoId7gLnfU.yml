description: "Using a Managed Kubernetes Service in the Enterprise - Sujit D'Mello & Daniel Selman, Microsoft \n\nAll the major cloud providers have managed Kubernetes services such as GKE (Google Cloud Platform), EKS (Amazon Web Services) and AKS (Microsoft Azure). These managed services aim to provide you a Kubernetes environment which is mostly managed by the cloud vendor.   Unfortunately, these services do not give you much access to the underlying Kubernetes cluster resources. You are limited to using the kubectl command. While convenient, Enterprises often have demanding functional and operational requirements to meet compliance or corporate standard needs. Some of these are:  - Custom logging and monitoring - Anti-malware  - Specific networking and zoning  - Custom CA certificates and cipher suites - Custom host files - Externalizing configuration - Etc.  We will show you how you can meet these Enterprise requirements with creative use of Kubernetes constructs and container initialization! \n\nTo Learn More: https://sched.co/GrU6"
