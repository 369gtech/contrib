recordingDate: 1557110999
description: "\"Speaker: Pamela McANulty\n\nIf you haven't tried multiprocessing or you are trying to move beyond `multiprocessing.map()`, you will likely find that using Python's `multiprocessing` module can get quite intricate and convoluted.  This talk focuses on a few techniques (starting, shutting down, data flow, blocking, etc) that will maximize `multiprocessing`â€™s efficiency, while also helping you through the complex issues related to coordinating startup and _especially_ shutdown of your multiprocess app.\n\n\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2019 and https://github.com/PyCon/2019-slides\""
