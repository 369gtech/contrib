description: "From OSCOn 2015 in Portland: Nature uses digital coding for replication, storage, and error correction, but relies on analog coding for control. Technology will follow. We are starting to treat streams of bits the way vacuum tubes treat streams of electrons, implementing analog processing upon a digital substrate, the same way digital processing was implemented using analog components, the first time around. This signals a coming analog revolution as far reaching as the digital revolution, but in the age of all things digital, it is a revolution that dares not speak its name.\n\nAbout George Dyson:\nGeorge Dyson is a historian of technology whose subjects have included the development (and redevelopment) of the Aleut kayak (Baidarka, 1986), the evolution of artificial intelligence (Darwin Among the Machines, 1997), and a path not taken into space (Project Orion, 2002). His recent Turingâ€™s Cathedral (2012) illuminates the transition from numbers that mean things to numbers that do things in the aftermath of World War II.\n\nWatch more from OSCON 2015: https://goo.gl/vD6vda\nFind out more about OSCON: http://oscon.com/open-source-2015\nDon't miss an upload!
