description: "Joel Stanley\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/210/\n\nClang Built Linux is a collection of efforts to get the upstream kernel building with Clang. It has resulted it patches to the build system, kernel code, and llvm/clang it self.\r\n\r\nThis talk will demonstrate how to build a kernel with clang, and highlight the remaining work to be done.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
