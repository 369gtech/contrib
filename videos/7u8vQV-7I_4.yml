description: "Speaker: Jinny Wong, Engineering Manager, Carousell\n\nThis talk is about the time when I was temporarily blind for a weekend, and how suddenly, web accessibility became both a boon and an annoyance to me. In this lightning talk I share about what I went through while \"blind\", and tips to improve your website's accessibility in order to enable more people to easily access and use your website, regardless of ability.\n\nSpeaker's Bio\n\nJinny is an Engineering Manager at Carousell, and provides strategic and technical guidance to the engineering team. She graduated with a bachelors degree in computer science from Monash university. When she is not serious at work, Jinny owns two cats with her husband.
