title: 'YOW! Singapore/Hong Kong 2017 Joe Albahari - Pushing C# to the limit'
recordingDate: 1507172400
description: "C# is a language of breadth. At one end it allows low-level programming with pointers and lock-free synchronization; at the other end, it sports high-level features such as closures, expressions trees and asynchronous functions.\n\nWhich leads us to a challenge: can we write a non-contrived program that uses all of the above? The answer is “of course!”, and I’m going to walk you through a practical example: a high-speed communications library built on shared memory (and used in production!)\n\nCome and join the author of C# 7 in a Nutshell and LINQPad in an advanced session, where we step outside the box and play with all of C#’s best toys at once.\n\nJoe Albahari is an O’Reilly author and the inventor of LINQPad. He’s written seven books on C# and LINQ, including “C# 7.0 in a Nutshell”. He speaks regularly at conferences and user groups, and has been a C# MVP for nine years running.\n\nFor more information on YOW! Conference, visit,\nhttp://yowconference.sg"
