description: "DOES18 Las Vegas - Software quality matters. Building quality in and shifting-left testing are key principles of DevOps and continuous delivery. And yet Testing and QA often end up as the “middle child” of your DevOps journey: the stage in the pipeline that’s too often put on the back-burner, until you realize you have a serious bottleneck, or when things break. Test automation is one of the most difficult hurdles—and he Achilles heel— for large enterprises looking to accelerate their delivery. The problem is aggravated particularly when needing to support legacy code, complex matrix of targets/supported platforms, or testing of embedded chips or devices that cannot be as easily updated. Too often, we see testing being handled manually—introducing risk, delays, re-work and unpredictable processes. Test engineers commonly scramble to navigate between the pace of Dev, and the requirements of Ops around environments, compliance, security, and more. In this talk we’ll share Intel’s journey to systematically build quality in, treating testing and QA not just as an integral part of the pipeline, but as the key driver—and the poster child— of our DevOps transformation. Learn how Intel builds quality into the delivery pipeline, the patterns we’ve adopted to simplify the complex testing matrix and scale test automation, the processes we have in place to ensure test coverage, security, detect errors quickly, and optimize for quality. In addition, we’ll share how our detailed quality dashboards and testing data became the key indicators—for both technical teams and the executives—to gauge our release readiness, expected quality and DevOps maturity.\n\nBuilding Quality In: QA and Test Automation at Intel\n\nManish Aggarwal, Software Engineering Manager, Intel\n\nManish is a Software Engineering Manager at Intel.
