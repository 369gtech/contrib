It clearly demonstrated that attackers injecting malicious code into libraries we use is not just a theoretical problem, but something that happens in practice\n\nWe'll talk about how the new version of Hoplon helps mitigate this problem using public key cryptography and a simple trust model - all of that without the need for a trusted third party or abandoning the common package ecosystem.\n\nRead the full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/jacek-krolikowski/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - JACEK KRÓLIKOWSKI\nCreator of Rexbug and Hoplon, chronic optimiser\n\nJacek has been working full time with Elixir since 2016, building messaging products, payment networks, and open source projects. Before that he programmed for Microsoft and tried his luck in algorithms competitions. He loves simple yet powerful tools and interfaces that are hard to use wrong.\n\nMore on Jacek Królikowski: https://codesync.global/speaker/jacek-krolikowski/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM STO 19\nCode BEAM STO is powered by Code Sync.
