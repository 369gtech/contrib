description: "Wrapping text into multiple lines may seem trivial at first, but there's actually a lot of subtleties, and many possible variations. Even more so when you consider the diversity of typographical practices in various languages and writing systems, but even when you don't. Luckily, CSS has tools to help you with that. However, as there is quite a few pieces interacting together, it may not be obvious at first sight how it all fits together, and the somewhat odd naming of the properties doesn't help.\n\nIn this talk, Florian Rivoal will do a tour of all the relevant properties, explain how each work, how they interact, how a few special HTML elements and unicode characters fit into this picture, and the differences in behavior associated with different languages. He will also go through some practical limitations of existing implementations and possible work arounds, and will illustrate how to put all this into practice in a number of examples.\n\nSlides: https://florian.rivoal.net/talks/line-breaking/\nAbout Florian: https://florian.rivoal.net/\nFollow Florian: https://twitter.com/frivoal\n\nMore about CSS Day: https://cssday.nl or https://twitter.com/cssdayconf\nReceive conference announcements in your inbox: https://cssday.nl/subscribe"
