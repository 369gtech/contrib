title: 'Making data science notebook collaborative - Jan Matas [PyData Prague #8 2020]'
language: English
recordingDate: 1602859577
description: "Jupyter notebook is now one of the most popular tools for data scientists, even though it is fairly difficult to work with it in a team setting. In this talk, we will first explore how notebooks work under the hood, then we will discuss how we can build collaboration features to enable real-time editing (like google docs) and finally we will address some security challenges inherent to having collaborative data science tools in the cloud.\n\nwww.pydata.cz\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
