description: "Steve Wozniak got creative with the Apple ][ floppy drive, creating a system that used less complicated hardware and was cheaper, accomplishing much in software instead. Dr Steve Bagley explains.\n\nThe graphic showing where sector holes were read is incorrect. Sector hole was seen where Dr Bagley showed. Earlier 8 inch floppy disks had different standards for hard sector disks, some at the hub, some near the outside of the disk- which is what the graphic was trying to illustrate. \n\nRob Miles on Game Playing AI: https://youtu.be/5oXyibEgJr0\nMusical Floppy Drives: https://youtu.be/C3dU5u4xXaY\nMagnetic Media (Floppies and Tapes): https://youtu.be/cWKo_dMUw7M \n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/computerphile\nhttps://twitter.com/computer_phile\n\nThis video was filmed and edited by Sean Riley.\n\nComputer Science at the University of Nottingham: http://bit.ly/nottscomputer\n\nComputerphile is a sister project to Brady Haran's Numberphile.
