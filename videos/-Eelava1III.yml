description: "Slides: https://www.slideshare.net/MichaRadomski1/miszo-radomski-making-internets-great-again\n\nMost of the developers one day will have to work with some kind of legacy application. I want to present a story about one of the applications I've been working on, which was started ~4 years ago as a hybrid of .NET MVC and AngularJS (1.3) and a journey our team came through last year to make it possible to support and more reliable than before. It's not a fairy tale - we still need to rewrite but it is still doing a good job in meeting business needs and making money.\n\n---\n\nConFrontJS 2018 - #Frontend #Conference in #Warsaw, Poland\nDate: 29 October 2018\nVenue: Campus Warsaw, Poland\n\n▶︎ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/events/2149337285314631/\n▶︎ Meetup: https://www.meetup.com/WarsawJS/events/255480769/\n▶︎ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/confrontjs.photos/\n▶︎ Twitter: https://twitter.com/confrontjs\n▶︎ Homepage: https://confrontjs.com/\n\nProduction: Strefa Zero\nhttps://strefazero.com.pl"
