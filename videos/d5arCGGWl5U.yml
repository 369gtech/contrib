title: 'Fireside Chat #17: Do we have to lower the bar to grow our development teams?'
language: English
recordingDate: 1634815158
description: "In this episode, our co-founders Sandro Mancuso, Mashooq Badar, and Spain Managing Director José E. Rodríguez Huerta discuss how to grow development teams in the current market conditions and the implication it has on the \"quality bar\" used during the interview process. There is a shortage of software professionals and remote work made completion for talent to be global. Companies need to grow but not always find the most suitable talent for their needs. What should they do? Lower the bar? But what is this bar? What else can they do? Growing people seems an answer but it is slow and quite expensive. This is a fascinating fireside chat that will be helpful to many different companies that are struggling to grow. \n\nIf you would like us to discuss a topic, please let us know in the comments and we will do our best to address it in a future episode. Any topics around Agile, Software Craftsmanship, Extreme Programming, technical practices, thought leadership, architecture, management, team dynamics, or anything related to technology or software projects are welcome. \n\nThe idea of the Fireside chat series is to record many informal conversations we normally have outside working hours. Topics are normally decided just before we start recording. Our objective is to have spontaneous conversations instead of something more structured or scripted. \n\nFor more information about Codurance, please visit our website: https://codurance.com/."
