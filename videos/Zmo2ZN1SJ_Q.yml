description: "\"IPython: The Productivity Booster\nEuroPython 2020 - Talk - 2020-07-24 - Parrot Data Science\nOnline\n\nBy Miki Tebeka\n\nIPython seems like a fancy Python shell. Why do we need it when we have PyCharm, VSCode, and other IDEs?\n\nIn this talk you'll learn how to use the power of IPython for rapid development and how you can integrate it with existing tools. We'll cover magic commands, calling external process, usage of extended history, async/await and more.\n\nYou'll also learn on some popular extension and cool configuration hacks (such as code%autoreload 2/code)\n\nSince Jupyter is based on IPython, you'll be able to use all of what you\nlearned in Jupyter Lab/Notebooks as well.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2020.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/\n\n    \""
