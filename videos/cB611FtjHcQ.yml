It provides intelligent routing, resiliency, and security features, so that service authors don't have to keep re-implementing them. Istio is rapidly taking off and there are great introductory talks everywhere. However in this session, we will dive deep to explore precisely how it does what it does, following one brave little packet in from the internet and back out again. At each point we’ll see how to configure the features of that component to exploit istio’s full potential. This will give a great insight into Istio's full power, and its fascinating architecture.\n\nOver the course of the session, we will look at the following components and features, as our packet encounters them:\n\ncloud / kubernetes networking\npod construction, namespaces, envoy interception\nPilot\nMixer\ncanaries\ntraffic splitting\ncircuit breaking\ntraffic mirroring\nmTLS\nistio ingress\nistio egress\ntelemetry\n\nMatt Turner \nFrom Tetrate\nMatt is a software engineer at Tetrate, working on Istio-related products. He's been doing Dev, sometimes with added Ops, for 10 years. His idea of \"full-stack\" is Linux, Kubernetes, and now Istio too. He's given several talks and workshops on Kubernetes and Istio, and is a co-organiser of the Istio London meetup."
