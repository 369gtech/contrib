title: 'Strategies for generic and specific key words - what is the difference? - Andreas Nilsson'
recordingDate: 1505215103
description: "It is imperative to be present in all digital channels today, but how should we prioritise between generic and specific key words? \n\nResearch shows that there is a big difference between generic and specific key words, and a strategy is needed to know when to use what. The strategy will require knowledge about the demands and needs of the person searching, as well as the behaviour of that person. If you search for the word “flower\" you are probably interested in generic information about flowers or inspiration. On the other hand, if you search for the words \"most popular flower in Sweden”, you will quickly learn that it is the tulip and then probably go on refining your search about tulips. \n\nSo how can we use this behaviour in our daily work as digital marketeers? \n\nThis is the first event within Digital Marketing at Foo Café and we are hoping to start a discussion group that will meet regularly to discuss issues in Digital Marketing and learn from each other. We welcome people working in digital marketing, people aspiring to work in this field, and people with a general interest in Digital Marketing.\n___________________________\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry. Foo Café is aimed at those interested in sharing and learning.\n\nBorn out of the desire to create a year round conference like atmosphere, Foo Café is THE place for planned and spontaneous meetings of all sizes and interests within the IT arena.\nEnjoy a coffee or a cold beer, along with light pub fare, and engage with other like minded individuals interested in sharing their knowledge and learning from one another.
