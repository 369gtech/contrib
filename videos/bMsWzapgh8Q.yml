description: "Agility Beyond Methodologies: Doing What Really Matters\nGiovanni Asproni (@gasproni (https://twitter.com/gasproni))\n\nMany (if not most) software development companies and teams claim to be \"Agile\"—often following a highly customised variation of Scrum or Kanban. However, most of them are still unable to deliver value to their customers—they still miss important deadlines, they still deliver still too many bugs, and often deliver the wrong functionality.\n\nIn this talk I'll explain why that happens, and I'll share my experience in helping several teams and companies (from small to very large) in solving those issues, and I'll give some practical advice that you can apply right away in your projects to make them run much more smoothly and successfully (provided you apply the required hard work).\n\nThe talk will touch on the most important aspects to run a project successfully, including (but not limited to):\n\n• Technical skills\n\n• Management skills\n\n• Processes and tools\n\n• Modern Agile\n\n• How to create a methodology that works for your context\n\n• An recent example on how I helped a team to go from 5-6 stories per sprint (with a quite upset customer) to over 20 (with the same customer becoming much happier) without using any magic or tricks\n\nGiovanni Asproni\n\nGiovanni is a Principal Consultant for Zuhlke Engineering. Before joining Zuhlke he worked for many years as a free-lance IT professional, providing consulting, training and advice, as well as coding, to projects of all sizes, in several application domains.\n\nHe is a past Chair of the London XPDay and the ACCU conferences, and the Industry & Practice co-chair for XP2016. He is a member of the Agile Alliance, the ACM and the IEEE Computer Society, and contributed to the book 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know, published by O'Reilly."
