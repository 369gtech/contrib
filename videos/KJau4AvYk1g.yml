description: "Hello from the Grace Hopper Conference 2017!\nVictoria was one of the many talented, intelligent women who came by our booth AND was willing to be interviewed.\nA couple of interesting points of this video:\n- The use of C++ in academia in advanced CS courses.\n- The demand for C++ experience by employers. This fact is particularly satisfying, as there were more than a few people who mentioned to me at our booth that they thought C++ was \"dead\", \"irrelevant\", or \"obsolete\".  I really don't know the source of this misunderstanding, yet wanted to share that Victoria's experience contradicts these myths."
