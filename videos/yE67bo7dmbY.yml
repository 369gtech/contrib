recordingDate: 1355517443
description: "Nervous about standing up in front of an audience to give that first lightning talk? Or curious about how conferences evaluate proposals, and what happens when your proposal gets accepted? Or wondering how the heck to prepare a talk that gets audiences excited? \nWhatever your goal and level of experience, you'll get something new out of this evening of info, support, and brainstorming. We'll hear from Sarah Mei, Pamela Fox, and others who've done this stuff a time or two. Then we'll breakout into small groups to help each other take the next steps"
