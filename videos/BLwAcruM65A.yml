description: "OpenBSD includes a variety of tools for building robust web server\nsolutions. The httpd web server is a lean, fast platform for serving\nweb pages. Relayd allows you to distribute a siteâ€™s load between\nmultiple servers for redundancy, extra capacity, or both. These two\nservers, combined with CARP, PF, and other OpenBSD tools, let you\nslice hundreds of thousands of dollars off the cost of deploying\nyour applications."
