You will not hear anything cool. No new libraries, languages. No clever code. No buzzwords even.\n\nI want to show you how you can use the features you already know to write less code and make the code so easy to understand that people who join your project can be productive on their first day.\nYou didn't come to a tech conference to see that, did you? Your new, shiny toys are not here. Go somewhere else ;)\n\nRead the full abstract: http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2019/bartosz-mikulski\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - BARTOSZ MIKULSKI\nAn unpassionate programmer\n\nA Java/Scala programmer with almost 8 years of experience.
