description: "Intro: Testing SIG - Aaron Crickenberger, Google & Steve Kuznetsov, Red Hat \n\nThe Kubernetes test infrastructure schedules and executes all of the tests which validate pull requests and repositories in the Kubernetes ecosystem every day. This presentation will explore how job authors can make use of new job configuration options to write jobs that execute identically inside and outside of the test infrastructure while requiring a minimal set of configuration to be provided. Jobs defined in this manner have reproducible behavior for local debugging and do not require job authors to adopt test-infrastructure-specific frameworks or workflows. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/GrbJ"
