The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nSponsored Session: Opsani - Continuous Optimization as a Service \n\nManual tuning is an impossible outdated task/ Enterprises are over-provisioning their systems with CPU, memory, among other resources, all of which drive up costs.  The solution is performance tuning automation. Come and learn from Opsani's Co-founder and CTO as he illustrates his personal journey in the cloud industry and how it has taught him the need for continuous optimization as a service for enterprises. Opsani allows companies to tune a single service or all services across the service delivery platform autonomously. Opsani continuously delivers value through higher performance, improved availability, and lower costs.  See how some of the largest enterprises have autonomously optimized thousands of their workloads across their service delivery platform with Opsani, saving countless human hours for developers and budget dollars, while delivering better customer experience. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ff1F"
