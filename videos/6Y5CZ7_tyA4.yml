description: "Filmed at https://2019.dotgo.eu on March 25th in Paris. More talks on https://dotconferences.com/talks\n\nIn the Go standard library and beyond, assembly language is used to provide access to architecture and OS-specific features, to accelerate hot loops in scientific code, and provide high-performance cryptographic routines. For these applications correctness is paramount, yet assembly functions can be painstaking to write and nearly impossible to review. Michael demonstrates how to leverage code generation tools to make high-performance Go assembly functions safe and easy to write and maintain."
