title: 'Why Isn''t My Query Using an Index?'
language: English
recordingDate: 1502110706
description: "“Why isn’t my query using an index?” is a common question people have when tuning SQL. This session explores the factors that influence the optimizer’s decision to answer this question. It does so by comparing fetching rows from a database table to finding all the red M&Ms a packet, and contrasts using an index range scan and a full table scan. It also introduces the concepts of blocks and the clustering factor. The session offers a discussion of how these affect the optimizer's calculations, and includes a demo of how these concepts work in practice using real SQL queries. This session is intended for developers who want to learn the basics of how the optimizer chooses between an index range or full table scan.\n\nSpeaker: Chris Saxon"
