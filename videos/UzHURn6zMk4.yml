description: "The Art of Simplicity:\n\nWe've been told to keep things simple. It turns out, that's easily said than done. Creating something simple is, well, not really that simple. If simple was sitting next to us, would we even recognize it? Is my design simple, is yours simple? How can we tell? That's a simple question, but the answer to it is... well come to this talk to find out.\nDr. Venkat Subramaniam is an award-winning author, founder of Agile Developer, Inc., creator of agilelearner.com, and an instructional professor at the University of Houston. He has trained and mentored thousands of software developers in the US, Canada, Europe, and Asia, and is a regularly-invited speaker at several international \n\nconferences. Venkat helps his clients effectively apply and succeed with sustainable agile practices on their software projects. Venkat is a coauthor of multiple technical books, including the 2007 Jolt Productivity award winning book Practices of an Agile Developer. You can find a list of his books at agiledeveloper.com. You can reach Venkat by email at venkats@agiledeveloper.com or on Twitter at @venkat_s.\n\nBuilding a Chatbot Front-end for Blockchain Transactions and Serverless Functions APIs:\n\nCloud development is at full speed, and Oracle is adding more and more platform services and infrastructure capabilities to run all sorts of workloads, from de facto server-side Open Source technology to enterprise grade Oracle technology. In this keynote, we will expose you to how our users are leveraging disruptive technology like Blockchain, adopting smart user interface with conversational AI by coding chatbots, and implementing all sorts of APIs with increasing productivity by embracing a Serverless functions approach with a NoSQL (Cassandra) data storage. Plus, this keynote is full of demos for you to understand real modern Cloud development.\nAs vice president of product management and strategy at Oracle, Siddhartha Agarwal is responsible for division strategy and revenue growth (organic and inorganic) for Oracle Cloud Platform (PaaS) and Oracle Fusion Middleware across all product lines globally, a more than $4.5B business."
