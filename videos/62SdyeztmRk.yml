description: "Keynote: Freedom: For Better and For Worse - Stephen O'Grady, Principal Analyst & Co-founder, RedMonk    \n\nToday developers enjoy a freedom to create that is without precedent. They are faced with an embarrassment of riches in tool choices, and even ten person teams can run services with a billion users. All of this freedom is not without cost, however, and developers need to think critically about their choices and which choices are important to them. In this talk, we’ll explore this seeming paradox and strategies for how developers are responding to the challenges and opportunities in front of them.\n\nStephen O'Grady\nRedMonk\nStephen O'Grady is a Principal Analyst and Co-founder of RedMonk.
