description: "LISA16 - The Hard Truths about Microservices and Software Delivery\n\nAnders Wallgren, Chief Technology Officer, Electric Cloud and Avantika Mathur, Product Manager, ElectricFlow\n\nEverybody’s talking about Microservices right now. But are you having trouble figuring out what it means for you?\n\nAs software organizations continue to invest in achieving faster release cycles and Continuous Delivery (CD) of their applications, we see increased interest in microservices architectures, which—on the face of it—seems like a natural fit for enabling CD.\n\nWith Microservices, what was once one application, with self-contained processes, is now a complex set of independent services that connect via the network. Each microservice is developed and deployed independently, often using different languages, technology stacks, and tools. While Microservices support agility—particularly on the development side—they come with many technical challenges that greatly impact your software delivery pipelines, as well as other operations downstream.\n\nAre you considering Microservices?\nDo they make sense for your particular use case?\nWhat are some of the “gotchas” you should be aware of?\nAre you looking for best practices on how to get started with microservices?\nAre you looking for tips for designing your delivery pipeline(s) for microservice-driven apps?\nHow will your existing practices need to change to take advantage of microservices?\nThis session outlines some of the hard truths and challenges with microservices—among them the impact of the mono/micro hybrid state; increased pipeline variations; enforcing governance and compliance standards; complexities of integration testing and monitoring and operations across the growing heterogeneous environments; and difficulties around system-level visibility and management.\n\nNext we will outline concrete best practices on how to address these challenges as you get started with implementing microservices and designing your pipeline and processes to support microservices-driven applications.\n\nView the full LISA16 Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa16/conference-program"
