description: 'Early this year, after being fed up with the original app, I started building an iOS app that''s set out to help thousands of riders all over Georgia. I started by exploring what data was available and how I could use it to give riders a better experience while using public transport. While this may sound easy, it certainly wasn''t easy at all as a third party developer on foreign terrain with many hurdles to overcome. Come join me in this talk and see the many ways could you change the world around you with an app.'
