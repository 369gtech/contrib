description: "In this video, I explain the basics of recurrent neural networks. Then we code our own RNN in 80 lines of python (plus white-space) that predicts the sum of two binary numbers after training.\n\nCode for this video:\n\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/recurrent_neural_net_demo\n\nI created a Slack channel for us, sign up here:\nhttps://wizards.herokuapp.com/\n\nThank @iamtrask for a great RNN article:\nhttps://iamtrask.github.io/2015/11/15/anyone-can-code-lstm/\n\nand this piece by Karpathy on RNN's deserves some sort of award:\nhttp://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/\n\nAnother great RNN article:\nhttp://nikhilbuduma.com/2015/01/11/a-deep-dive-into-recurrent-neural-networks/\n\nTensorflow RNNs:\nhttps://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.10/tutorials/recurrent/index.html\n\nThanks so much for watching my videos, I do this stuff for you guys. I'm about to hit 10K subscribers soon. If and when I do, I'm going to start working on a machine learning music video to celebrate! With better production quality than my last two!\n\nI recently created a Patreon page. If you like my videos, feel free to help support my effort here!:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/user?ty=h&u=3191693\n\nMuch more to come so please subscribe, like, and comment.\nFollow me:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/sirajraval\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/sirajology Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/sirajraval/ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/sirajraval/"
