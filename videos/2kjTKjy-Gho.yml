title: 'RustConf 2020 - Rust for Non-Systems Programmers by Rebecca Turner'
language: English

description: "Rust for Non-Systems Programmers by Rebecca Turner\n\nRust improves on C and C++ by providing memory safety and better concurrency primitives. But for a lot of tools and programs, dynamic languages like Python, Ruby, and Perl are already memory safe and fast enough. “Rust for Non-Systems Programmers” showcases some of the reasons I like Rust as someone who's not a systems programmer, including mutability tracking, development tooling, great documentation, a welcoming community, type-inference/algebraic datatypes, and error handling."
