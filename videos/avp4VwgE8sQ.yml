description: "Artificial intelligence in the future, at least represented in science fiction, can learn, interpret, and take action based on data analysis. AI in production is the present, a present that feels decidedly futuristic. AI is transforming the IoT at the edge: improving healthcare outcomes through more accurate diagnoses, automating factory assembly lines, reducing traffic congestion in smart cities, and much more.\n\nEnhancing the IoT with AI will directly create new products and services; without AI, data from the deployments will have limited value. Jonathan Ballon explains why Intel’s leading portfolio of AI and computer vision edge technology will drive advances in machine learning, accelerate natural language processing, and create opportunities to monitor and inspect where humans can’t—improving how we work and live.\n\nSubscribe to O'Reilly on YouTube: http://goo.gl/n3QSYi\n\nFollow O'Reilly on: \nTwitter: http://twitter.com/oreillymedia\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/OReilly\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/oreillymedia\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/8459/"
