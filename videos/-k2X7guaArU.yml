description: 'The introduction of functional interfaces in Java 8 allows to easily use the concepts of functional programming in Java. But Java is still an OOP language, and i think it''s interesting to take a look at a little farther and anwser to the question how FP and OOP can be mixed together in Java 8. This talk will use the design patterns of the GoF as a common story, and show a lot of codes explaining how most of the behavioral and creational patterns can be re-written using a mix between FP and OOP in Java.'
