recordingDate: 1467276120
description: "Spring I/O 2016 - 19 -20 May Barcelona\n\nIn this talk I focus on a core aspect of REST - Hypermedia and HATEOAS and share the practical steps of building this out into an existing API with Spring HATEOAS and Spring Data REST. \nYou’ll first learn about the basics - content negotiation, API discoverability at the root and introducing links into the responses of your API to help guide your clients. \nWe’ll then go into more advanced scenarios such as versioning, evolving an API with the right use of Hypermedia and the JSON-API spec. \n\nFinally, we’ll circle back and look at some great examples in public APIs in our ecosystem."
