description: "An expanded version of her Spring One talk: Make Your Kubernetes Clusters Production-Ready with VMware Tanzu\n\n---\n\nWhen you first started experimenting with Kubernetes, you may have started locally or on a set of servers. With simple applications, you may only have used a container registry and Kubernetes itself. When looking to move your clusters to a production setting, there are many more considerations, such as: How will I manage my clusters? How do I handle monitoring and logging? How do I safely back up my cluster resources? How do I ensure that my container images are safe and secure?\n\nLet’s take a look at some production-ready solutions, such as VMware Tanzu Mission Control, VMware Tanzu Observability by Wavefront, Octant, Velero, and Harbor.\n\nThe astute observer might note we cheated slightly with the database restore by only deleting the pods, not the statefulset, so pretend Tiffany actually ran helm uninstall customers-db-mysql -n spring-pet-clinic” so the statefulsets don’t keep the data.” ;)\n\nTiffany is a senior developer advocate at VMware and is focused on Kubernetes. She previously worked as a software developer and developer advocate (nerd whisperer) for containers at Amazon. She also formerly worked at Docker and Intel. Prior to that, she graduated from Georgia Tech with a degree in electrical engineering. In her free time she likes to spend time with her fiancé, family, and friends, as well as dabble in photography. You can find her on Twitter @tiffanyfayj."
