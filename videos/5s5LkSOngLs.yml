description: "Nowadays, companies require very short release cycles, especially in lean startup environments.But to release often:\n\n  deployments should be routine, not terrifying.\n  configuration should require a few clicks, not a thousand-line shell script.\n  problems should be easy to spot, not buried in a log file.\nYou are a developer that need to release every week or every day with a single git commit and zero-downtime? Easily spot release performance or bugs issues? If required, roll back to previous version in few seconds and one click? And you don't want to manage any dedicated repository, monitoring, build, staging, production servers? So this talk is for you!We will explore Lean startup and DevOps concepts and share our experience on how to create a simple and fully automated build pipeline for Grails apps with a live demo, based on SaaS/cloud services: GitHub, Travis CI, NewRelic, AWS (ElasticBeanstalk, CloudFront), etc."
