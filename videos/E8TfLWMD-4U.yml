description: "\"Migrating your existing architecture from a monolith to microservices is a challenging task. Not only is the technology landscape different and overwhelming, but you also need a solid plan to bring the rest of the team along in the journey. How do you come up with such a plan? And perhaps an even more important question to ask if you’re working in or transitioning to an agile environment is: How can you challenge your team to constantly reevaluate and adopt new technologies?\nThis session covers the lessons learned from migrating a monolithic open source project to microservices using Jenkins X. You’ll learn common patterns, tweaks, and best practices that you could adopt to make the best of tools such as Jenkins X, Helm, Zeebe, and Kubernetes. The talk focuses on real-life examples and shows you how these tools can be used to speed your development practices and train high-performing teams.\"\n\nMauricio Salatino, Principal Software Engineer at Camunda\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/from-java-monoliths-to-k8s"
