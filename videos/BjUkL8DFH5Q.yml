description: "In this episode of Coffee with a Googler, Laurence Moroney sits down with Josh Dillon. Josh works on TensorFlow, Google’s open source library for numerical computation, which is typically used in Machine Learning and AI applications. He discusses working on the Distribution API, which is based on probabilistic programming. Watch this video to find out what exactly probabilistic programming is, where the use of Distributions and Bijectors comes into play, & how you can get started.
