How do you measure the experiences of your customers? How do you find bottlenecks in the system?\n\nOn our team, New Relic is a key part of the answer to all those questions. We'll take a look at the New Relic console for a running app to see how this all works.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
