description: "Creating a single microservice is a well-understood challenge. Creating a cluster of load-balanced microservices that are resilient and self-healing is not so easy. Managing that cluster with rollouts and rollbacks, scaling individual services on demand, and securely sharing secrets and configuration among services is even harder. Kubernetes, an open-source container management system, can help with this. In this video, Robert Kubis and Steffen Hanikelwith work with a simple microservice, containerize it using Docker, and scale it to a cluster of resilient microservices managed by Kubernetes. Along the way, you'll learn what makes Kubernetes a great system for automating deployment, operations, and scaling of containerized applications. In this session, FlixBus joins us to talk about experiences and best practices adopting and running Kubernetes in production.\n\nCheck out the ‘All Sessions’ playlist for the rest of the talks that were given at GDD Europe ’17: https://goo.gl/6BFfHv\nSubscribe to the Google Developers channel: http://goo.gl/mQyv5L"
