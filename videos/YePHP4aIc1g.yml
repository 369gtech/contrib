description: 'C++17 adds many new features: structured bindings, deduction guides, if-init expressions, fold expressions, if constexpr and enhanced constexpr support in the standard library. Each of these features are interesting, but what will be their cumulative affect on real code? We''ll explore how each feature may (or may not) help in real code for enhanced readability, compile time performance and runtime performance'
