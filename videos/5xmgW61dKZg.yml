description: "Lately, user centered design has become increasingly popular. If we fall into the trap of just doing what the client says, we forget that an important part of our role as IT experts, is to question each and every wish carefully.\n\nIn this talk, we look at why it is such a bad idea to do what your client tells you to do.
