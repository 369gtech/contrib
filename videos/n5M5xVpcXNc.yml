title: 'Sprinting In Place: The Cost of Missing Leadership Conversations (Douglas Jeffrey, 2019)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1636120919
description: "Are you missing the promised benefits of Agile? Douglas and Jeffrey believe that the biggest key to improved performance has been holding effective conversations on difficult topics like Trust, Fear, Why, Commitment and Accountability.\n\nFailure to have these conversations can lead to a wide range of symptoms, such as: resentment of external deadlines, failure in balancing quality vs speed, confusion over product direction, and conflict over estimates. Unfortunately most people have never learned the skills to have these difficult conversations effectively.\n\nIn their talk they'll explore how and why human brains default to ineffective strategies, the value of skill development for conversations, and teach you two of their favourite techniques to get started on the road to dramatic improvements: Coherence Busting and Test-Driven Development for People.\n\nWatch thousands more tech talks in our SkillsCast library at https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts"
