description: "Intro: NATS - Colin Sullivan & Wally Quevedo, Synadia \n\nJoin members of the NATS team to learn about NATS Messaging! Distributed systems architecture has been disrupted via decomposition as cloud technology has matured - we’ve seen a migration from monolithic applications to microservices. This has created a need for multiple communication patterns, location transparency, and the decoupling of data producers and consumers. NATS is a cloud-native messaging project that addresses these needs and others. In this discussion, we'll introduce you to NATS: how NATS came to be, its DNA and cover some of the problems that it solves. We’ll describe common messaging patterns, when to use them, and design principles to create NATS enabled cloud-native applications. For more information be sure to follow this up with the NATS deep dive! \n\nTo Learn More: https://sched.co/Grbt"
