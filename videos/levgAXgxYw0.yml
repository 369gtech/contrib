All kinds of web maps and visualizations can now be produced by users with little technical skill. However, there is a general lack of understanding amongst developers of GeoWeb resources of how to design an effective map using these new technologies which impacts directly on the experience of users accessing a GeoWeb project. These problems are not unexpected given the history of development of novel technologies in general and specifically the history of the web. We should be reflecting on this history in order to spread knowledge of how to develop effective and engaging materials for the GeoWeb."
