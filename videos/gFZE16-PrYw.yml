recordingDate: 1496649405
description: 'In this talk we''ll see how living and operating in the 21st century calls for a whole new set of skills for managers and how, most relevantly, calls for a mindset that''s slightly different from the one we got used to in past decades. We''ll talk about the connection between mindset, complexity and agility; and you''ll get some practical advice that can help you operate better in these domains. main point of the talk is that many organizations struggle to keep up because their culture, mindset and processes are designed for a Complicated domain (in Cynefin terms), whereas Agile is Business in Complexity. The talk hints managers to what it takes to make the transition.'
