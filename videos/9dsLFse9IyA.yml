description: "Speaker: Mike Anderson\n\n== Talk\nDigital assets are poised to change the world, with decentralised cryptocurrencies, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and smart contracts creating new opportunities for economic value exchange and product innovation: a space which might be called \"The Internet of Value\".\n\nConvex (https://convex.world/) is a full-stack solution for the Internet of Value, built using Java technology and offering radically better performance than traditional blockchain approaches.\n\nIn this talk we will look at the principles of creating digital assets for the Internet of Value, explain the inner workings of Convex and demonstrate how to build your own digital assets using a simple Java API for the Convex network.\n\n== Speaker\nMike is the Managing Director of The Convex Foundation, a non-profit organisation dedicated to helping organisations realize the potential of decentralised ledger technology for the Internet of Value. He is the inventor of the Convergent Proof of Stake consensus algorithm, which forms the basis for the Convex network.\n\nPreviously, Mike has held CTO roles at multiple companies, with a focus on blockchain, data science and AI. He also worked as a strategy consultant at McKinsey and company, specialising in software architecture, technology strategy and healthcare IT.\n\nMike is a keen open source software developer, and contributes his time to leading multiple open source projects, especially in the Clojure and Java ecosystems. He is the creator of core.matrix, a library for advanced numerical algorithms.\n\nMike holds double first in Mathematics and Economics from Cambridge University, and a Master of Business Administration (with Distinction) from INSEAD.
