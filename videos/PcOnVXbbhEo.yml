description: "The talk from .NET Fest conference in Kyiv, Ukraine.\nPresentation: will be added soon\nFb: https://www.facebook.com/dotNETFest/\nWebsite: http://dotnetfest.com/\n\nIt’s a familiar scene. You’re on the train, and your phone goes ‘ping’. You take it out of your pocket and hey - someone sent you a message! It’s a funny picture of a cat! You send back ‘LOL’, you put your phone back in your pocket… but have you ever stopped to think about what’s actually involved in making that happen? Inside even the most basic smartphone there are literally hundreds of innovations, algorithms and inventions - but how do they really work? How were they developed? And what’s the next generation of algorithms and applications going to look like?\nIn this talk, we’ll take a deep dive into the technology behind those everyday experiences, and demystify the algorithms and abstractions that make our digital world go round. We’ll look at everything from network addressing algorithms, frequency-hopping cellular data networks and shortest path optimisation, to filesystem design, compression algorithms and text encoding schemes. Whether you’re a programmer, a product owner or just somebody who loves using the latest tech, after watching this talk you’ll never look at your phone quite the same way again."
