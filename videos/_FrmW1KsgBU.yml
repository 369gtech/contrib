description: "This session describes an end-to-end security architecture for M2M deployments. A comprehensive security architecture enables all interactions between devices and servers to be authenticated and authorized. The presentation explains the use of identity to enable trust relationships and covers enrollment, management, transport security, and runtime security, including issues created by multitenant embedded systems. It also looks at the use of secure hardware such as Java Card or a trusted execution environment (TEE) to increase security.\n\n\nAuthor:\nNoel Poore\nNoel is an Architect in the Embedded Java group.
