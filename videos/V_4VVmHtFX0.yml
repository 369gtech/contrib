title: 'Paul Bakker - Tutorial: Developing modular cloud applications with OSGi'
recordingDate: 1391777888
description: "Bio:\n\nPaul Bakker is a software architect for Luminis Technologies. His current focus is on building modular enterprise applications and the cloud. Paul believes that modularity and the cloud are the two main challenges we have to deal with to bring technology to the next level, and is working on making this possible for mainstream software development. Today, he is working on educational software focused on personalized learning for high school students in the Netherlands. Paul is an active contributor on open source projects such as Amdatu, Apache ACE, and Bndtools, and is a member of the OSGi Enterprise Expert Group. He is also co-author of the book \"Modular Cloud Apps with OSGi\" recently published by O'Reilly. He has experience as a trainer on Java-related technology and is a regular speaker at conferences like JavaOne, Devoxx, and Jfokus. He was awarded the JavaOne 2012 Rock Star Speaker award.\n\nTutorial:\nDeveloping modular cloud applications with OSGi\n\nIn this session, you will learn how to create modular, robust, and durable enterprise applications fit for the cloud age. Modularity forces separation of concerns, which enables you to replace parts of a system without breaking others. Using OSGi and a wealth of open source enterprise components, the presentation shows you how to combine those apparently opposite worlds into coherent applications. It also shows you everything you need to know about setting up your development environment to get started right away. The session features lots of live coding!\n\nYou will learn about modular architecture and how to practically achieve this using OSGi. Some of the topics included:\n\n- Creating OSGi bundles, with proper implementation hiding\n- Dynamic OSGi Services\n- Creating real world components such as MongoDB data access and RESTful web services\n- Semantic versioning"
