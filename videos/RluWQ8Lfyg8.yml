This talk dives deep into Serverless, particularly Serverless Lambda Functions, and their benefits and drawbacks to web applications.\n\nWe will also discuss how they can benefit business, being extremely cheap to implement and maintain. As a practical, technical case study, we will examine serverless performance across a number of popular front-end UI frameworks and measure various metrics relevant to a serverless application.\n\nTejas enjoys people, code, and talking about code to people. Having begun coding at age 8, today Tejas travels around the world, encouraging, educating and empowering developers in the web development community."
