title: 'GeeCON 2018: Marc Struberg - The cool and the cruel of MicroService'
recordingDate: 1532331015
description: 'Over the last few years everyone has been raving about MicroServices and how they will make any developers life so much better. Did this promise deliver? What was the reason we invented MicroService in the first place? Where are the barriers and for which scenarios does it pay off to use MicroServices? And in which situations do you better resist the temptation to always use the latest and greatest new hyped tools like MicroServices? Let''s find out! In this talk I''ll also like to share some feedback from various big real-world projects where this approach did sometimes work - and sometimes miserably failed... The target audience are managers and developers alike. I''ll not dive into technical details except when it''s necessary to understand the shortcomings of a certain design.'
