description: "Speaker: Roxanne Chia\n\nBeing an educator has given me a larger and newer audience, most of whom impressionable teenagers between the ages of 17-19. Blogging then has become a role more accountable, and has more far-reaching and in-depth effects than ever before.\n\nA new social responsibility is established and reinforced, and new personal blogging guidelines are aligned with the integrity embodied in the field of education.\n\nAbout the speaker:\n\nRoxanne Chia is a beauty blogger (2010–present), ex-lecturer, and educator (2011-2016). She has been blogging on WordPress for 6 years and has recently switched to doing it full-time. She constantly seeks out collaboration opportunities, and has international readership from Asia, USA, and Europe.\n\nEvent Page: https://2016.singapore.wordcamp.org/\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/VfF4/"
