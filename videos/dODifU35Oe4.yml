title: 'This Week in Cloud Native: Cluster API & Tinkerbell'
language: English
recordingDate: 1611781456
description: 'Up until now managing Kubernetes infrastructure outside of cloud providers has been difficult, and while there have been attempts to ease management of Kubernetes clusters within the data center previously we feel those attempts have been focused mostly on trying to shoehorn the management of clusters into legacy practices. With Cluster API and Tinkerbell we are attempting to bring real cloud-native management of infrastructure into the data center'
