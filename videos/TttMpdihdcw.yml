description: "When it comes to evaluating candidates for software engineering roles, it's hard to keep up with the latest and greatest techniques. We know logic puzzles don't work. Writing pseudocode on a white board is so tired and cliche at this point that companies brag about not doing that. Teams have resorted to what seems like an obvious choice at first blush: just have the candidate write some code. This new trend may have some unintended consequences, though. In this talk, you'll learn how to design an interview process which allows you to evaluate candidates without making them code for you.\n\nEVENT:\n\nRailsConf 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nPete Holiday\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nconfreaks YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/Confreaks"
