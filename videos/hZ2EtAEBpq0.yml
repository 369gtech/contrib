description: "Google Tech Talks\nJanuary, 15 2008\n\nABSTRACT\n\nREST Describe & Compile is an editor and a compiler for REST Web services based on SUN engineer Marc Hadley's Web Application Description Language (WADL). REST Describe & Compile is implemented using the Google Web Toolkit (GWT) and is split up in two sub-apps:\n\nREST Describe:\n\nThis component takes a (set of) URL(s) as input and tries to analyze the parameters regarding parameter types and Web service structure. It then generates a WADL representation for the given URL(s), represented in an editable, tree-like form. Typical input would be GET http://webservices.amazon.com/onca/xml?Service=AWSECommerceService=0ZMFM7HPBYYY0SPERCR2=ItemSearch=Enterprise+Integration+Patterns=Books, or GET http://picasaweb.google.com/data/feed/api/user/{userID}/albumid/{albumID}/photoid/{photoID}?kind=kinds=0=10.\n\nREST Compile:\n\nThis component allows for the WADL representation of a Web service to be &quot;compiled&quot; to working programming code in various languages (for the moment these languages are Java, PHP5, Python, and Ruby). The idea is thus similar to WSDL2Java, however in a more general WADL2Anything way.\n\nThe application can be tested online: http://tomayac.de/rest-describe/latest/RestDescribe.html\n\nThere are some screencasts available on YouTube: http://youtube.com/profile?user=tomayac\n\n\nSpeaker: Thomas Steiner\nThomas Steiner works as a Customer Solutions Engineer from Barcelona, Spain, and has joined Google full-time only since October 1st. However, he has been with Google first as an intern and then as a temorary contractor since February 2005. During his time at Google, Thomas has created the Google APIlity PHP Library for the AdWords API, as well as the APIlity Agua Ajax application, which can be seen as an Ajax GUI for AdWords. From January 2007 till July 2007, Thomas did his Final Year Project with Google, where the REST Describe & Compile application was to be developed, hosted by Googler Patrick Chanezon."
