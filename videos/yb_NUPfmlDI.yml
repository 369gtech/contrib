description: "Full title - Žygimantas Medelis: Adding Narrative to BI Dashboards with Natural Language Generation\n\nData visualizations are not always sufficient in understanding important aspects of data. People have to interpret charts and build narratives about it. Natural language generation technology can be used to greatly improve the communicative power of the data. In this talk I will introduce NLG and will present a case through the use of two open source tools: Accelerate Text (NLG) and Metabase (BI)\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
