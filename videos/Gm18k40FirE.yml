description: "We invest so much in technology, so why do we seem to get so little benefit in return? We introduce new processes, tools, and methods, but when you stand back and squint, the organization still looks just the same.\n\nIs technology overhyped and oversold, as many would have us believe, or are we doing something that means we lose out on all those promised benefits? Societies work because we follow the rules, but what if those same rules are holding us back?\n\nThe problem may be because we are failing to change our habits. Dan North introduces some uncomfortable truths from Eliyahu Goldratt, author of The Goal, a cornerstone of modern management theory, that help us recognize and challenge this behavior and unlock the true value from our technology.\n\nSubscribe to O'Reilly on YouTube: http://goo.gl/n3QSYi\n\nFollow O'Reilly on: \nTwitter: http://twitter.com/oreillymedia\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/OReilly\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/oreillymedia\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/8459/"
