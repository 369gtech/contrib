description: "Serverless is the most clickbaity title for an actually interesting thing. Despite the name, serverless does not mean you’re not using a server, rather, the promise of serverless is to no longer have to babysit a server. Scaling is done for you, you’re billed only for what you use. In this session, Sarah will cover some key use cases for these functions within a Vue.js application: she’ll accept payments with stripe, gather geolocation data from Google Maps, and more! She’ll make it all work with Vue and Nuxt seamlessly, simplifying how to leverage this paradigm to be a workhorse for your application.\n\nSarah Drasner\nSenior Developer Advocate, Microsoft\nhttps://twitter.com/sarah_edo\nhttps://github.com/sdras\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc\n\nSave 10% off any FITC event with discount code 'youtube'.\nSee our upcoming events at www.fitc.ca\n\n#serverless #VueJS #Serverless"
