description: 'Once you start working with Big Data systems, you discover a whole bunch of problems you won’t find in monolithic systems. Monitoring all of the components becomes a big data problem itself. In the talk, we’ll mention all of the aspects that you should take in consideration when monitoring a distributed system using tools like Web Services, Spark, Cassandra, MongoDB, AWS.
