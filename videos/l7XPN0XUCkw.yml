In many applications, data-driven models now take as input massive numbers of “signals”, including words in text, locations frequented, merchants transacted with, web pages visited, things Liked on Facebook, and more. I will illustrate, using two or three predictive analytics examples, why various stakeholders need to understand the reasons for decisions: managers, engineers, data scientists, business customers … and consumers. I will show a general technique for understanding the decisions made based on these massive, sparse signals. I will close by suggesting how this might create an opportunity for making certain predictions about consumers more privacy friendly.\n\nAbout Foster Provost (NYU | Stern):\nFoster Provost is coauthor of the O’Reilly best-selling book, Data Science for Business (http://data-science-for-biz.com).
