description: 'Condé Nast, the publisher of such titles as WIRED, The New Yorker, GQ, Vogue, and Vanity Fair, consolidated the codebases of their 20+ websites to improve development speed and product flexibility. Multiple engineering teams built various interconnected components of the new software from the ground up; concurrently, design teams created a system that allows the publications to share the same code and retain their unique look and feel. This presentation explores early challenges of this change and how the evolution of our workflow streamlined the design and development process.'
