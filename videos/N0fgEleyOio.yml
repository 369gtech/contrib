description: "Building Event Streaming Applications with Serverless Kafka - Ricardo Ferreira, ConfluentSDCC \n\nApache Kafka is a well-known technology from the on-premises world, that is gradually being adopted in the cloud. However, because it has persistent capabilities (just like databases) architectures built around serverless are hard to implement. This will present an interesting approach to address this concern, where developers interested in serverless could still leverage Kafka without giving up on the pay-as-you-go and scale-as-much-as-you-need principles. A demo using a speaker-enabled device and functions will be used to clarify the concepts."
