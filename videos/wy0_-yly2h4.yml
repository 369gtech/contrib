title: 'Rickard Hansson - The Key Ingredient Retaining Users in Your App and Reducing Churn'
language: English
recordingDate: 1619709586
description: "\"A clear trend now when WFH (Work From Home) is the new normal, is that every and any app needs to help their users be more productive. \n\nEither you rely on outside ecosystems aka Slack, Teams, Asana, etc to accomplish that - with the, not so good, result of your users bouncing around like pinballs with no context, flow, or persistency... \n\n...OR you build it INTO YOUR APP as a native feature. \n\nI mean - \"Bring your tools to your team (users), save time, and avoid context-switching.\" \n\nActually, that last paragraph was copied and pasted from Slack describing why integrations are important. Sure, good for the user but why is that so important for Slack? Retention! And it AS important for you, and you can create the same in your app.\n\nSalesforce is doing it. DOMO is doing it. Zoom is doing it. They're all focusing on making their users more productive IN their apps, increasing the retention with every user. \n\nAnd so should you. \n\nAnd as the cherry on top... You. Reduce. Churn.\n\nLet's talk!\""
