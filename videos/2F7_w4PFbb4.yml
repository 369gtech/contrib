title: 'William Brander - Microfrontends and UI Composition - a Code-First Dive @ DevConf 2018'
recordingDate: 1539019336
description: "As developers we spend a lot of time structuring our systems just right. We make sure we select the right patterns, use the right combination of acronyms (CQRS + DDD + ES), and do all the right devops so that we can scale up/out/elastically. This adherence to best practices seems to fall apart at the front end though. We have separation on the back end, but on the front end this all needs to come together. How do we stop it from turning into a mess of spaghetti code? How do we prevent simple actions from triggering hundreds of web requests? Join William as he builds a .NET Core Composite UI using React from scratch.\n\nDevConf 2018 (http://devconf.pl)\n26-28 September 2018"
