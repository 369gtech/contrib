Do you wish to learn what Classification, Regression, Clustering and Feature Extraction techniques do, and how to apply them using the Oracle Machine Learning family of products?  Join us for this second chapter of the series “Oracle Machine Learning Office Hours – Machine Learning 101”.\n\nIn this \"ML Classification 102\" session we will pickup where we left off from our 101 Session, and go deeper in our discussions on ML algorithms, the importance of Feature Selection, and will explore even more the correct way to evaluate models using the Confusion Matrix and the many statistics that can be computed from it.\n\nWe will continue to make use of Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks, with Python and SQL as the underlying languages and OML4Py with AutoML for our demo environment.\n\nAskTOM Office Hours offers free, monthly training and tips on how to make the most of Oracle Database, from Oracle product managers, developers and evangelists.\n\nhttps://asktom.oracle.com/ \n\nOracle Developers portal: https://developer.oracle.com/\nSign up for an Oracle Cloud trial: https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/"
