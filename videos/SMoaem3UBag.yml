Linkerd, Istio, and Consul are some great examples. With Service Mesh Interface (SMI), adoption is becoming much easier.    Along with a lot of other features, Service Meshes are great at traffic shifting and observability which are helpful for microservice deployment and CI/CD platforms. Testing new versions in production with strategies such as Blue/Green, A/B, and canary rollouts are key in ensuring that deployments are error-free.     In this session, I will dig deep into how you can integrate Service Mesh into deployment pipelines and automate these kinds of CI/CD methods. I will talk about observability using projects such as Prometheus and how it is key to validate candidate releases with real time latency statistics down to specific paths/methods.    As always, I will include lots of demos! \n\nhttps://sched.co/Uadd"
