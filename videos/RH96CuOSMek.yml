However, as natural as functional programming feels to us, it is hard to teach well. In particular, professional functional languages are powerful tools for development, but are not necessarily the best tools beginners.  This talk is about teaching functional programming well using the Program by Design / DeinProgramm approach.  It will give an overview of effective teaching approaches, techniques and tools, and highlight pitfalls.\n\nRead the full abstract: http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2019/michael-sperber\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - MICHAEL SPERBER\nCEO of Active Group, functional programmer\n\nMichael Sperber is CEO of Active Group in TÃ¼bingen, Germany.
