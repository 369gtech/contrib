description: "This video was recorded at ElixirConf EU Virtual 2020 - https://www.elixirconf.eu/\n\nBuilding a solar powered weather station with Nerves | John Oxford - Software Engineer at  PowerSecure \n\nABSTRACT\nIf you aren’t familiar with the Nerves tooling system, or haven’t used it yet, then this talk will show you how easy it is to write Elixir code for your tiny Linux powered devices (Raspberry Pi, Beaglebone). We’ll briefly hear about the GPIO and I2C protocol and how you write code to program with them using the Elixir Circuits Libraries. Finally we’ll see how easy it is to build a solar panel to charge a battery to keep a Nerves powered system running 24/7.\n\n• Follow us on social: \n  Twitter: https://twitter.com/ElixirConfEU\n  LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/27159258\n\n• Looking for a unique learning experience?\n  Attend the next Code Sync conference near you! \n  See what's coming up at: https://codesync.global \n\n• SUBSCRIBE TO OUR CHANNEL\n  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC47eUBNO8KBH_V8AfowOWOw"
