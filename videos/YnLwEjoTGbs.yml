description: 'Google has a long association with Open Source, both by fostering its development and releasing its own software into the community. The man responsible for those programs, as well as assuring that Google complies with open source licenses in the software they use, is Chris DiBona, the Open Source program manager. Chris sat down with O''Reilly News at OSCON to talk about the work that Google does creating new Open Source developers through their High School and College programs such as Summer of Code, and how Google decides what software they will release into the community.'
