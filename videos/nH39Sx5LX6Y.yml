recordingDate: 1523538004
description: "Stephen Merity is a senior research scientist working on deep learning in San Francisco with Salesforce Research via the MetaMind acquisition. He's been lucky enough to work with fascinating people and groups over the years including Google Sydney, Freelancer.com, the Schwa Lab at the University of Sydney, the team at Grok Learning, the non-profit Common Crawl, and IACS @ Harvard. I met him at Nvidia's GTC conference in San Jose and asked him 67 Questions about his life and thoughts on Machine Learning. Enjoy! \n\nPlease Subscribe! And like. And comment.
