description: "Google Tech Talk\r\nSeptember 14, 2010\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nPresented by Sean D. Carasso.\r\n\r\nIn less than two years a small group of determined young people have created a global coalition for peace in Congo. Sean will share their unlikely story and show the potential for historic change inside our world's deadliest war.\r\n\r\nSpeaker Bio: An avid adventurer, Sean traveled the world with John Paul Dejoria and with every step wanted to see more. In 2008 he went to South Africa on a TOMS Shoe Drop and then headed north into the Democratic Republic of Congo. There he learned of children sent to the front lines of war, armed with only a whistle.\r\n\r\nThat night he wrote a small journal named Falling Whistles. The journal was forwarded around the world and he woke up to thousands of emails asking; what can we do? The Falling Whistles campaign was born with a simple response - make their weapon your voice and be a whistleblower for peace.\r\n\r\nOut of his garage-office in Venice California, Sean has partnered with local leaders in Congo to rehabilitate children and is creating a global coalition for peace in our world's deadliest war.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fallingwhistles.com"
