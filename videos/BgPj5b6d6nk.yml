description: "Speaker: Guillaume Duquesnay (GIOM CONSULTING)\n\nGiom is a natural born nerd hiding as an Agile coach. Never comfortable in the comfort zone, he puts himself into stupid life experiments, learning new skills, or new hobbies.\n\nHe loves to think over the boundaries, mixing tinkering, communication, business, hobbies, games, etc. He wants to find some simpler truths that connect them.\n\nHe tries to share as much as he can by coaching others and by sharing my learnings in public workshops and conferences.\n\nOriginally from France, he is based in Singapore working as an independent consultant and coach."
