description: "PyData Cyprus Meetup - July 2021 \n\n\nThis meetup was sponsored by RetailZoom\n\n\nTalk 1: Outlier Detection in Business\n\nAbstract\n------------\nOutlier detection is the process of identifying observations that deviate from the usual assumptions or from the pattern suggested by the majority of the data. These observations are termed as outliers. We will present the steps followed in order to detect abnormal trends in stores across an FMCG chain. We will also introduce the techniques used to detect outliers through visual examples of code.\n\nAbout the Speaker\n--------------------------\nPolina Hadjipanayiotou is a Data Scientist at RetailZoom since 2020. Working with more than a million of data on a daily basis, implementing models and algorithms for a number of businesses such as Healthcare, supermarkets, insurance . After finishing her MSc in Statistics at UCL, her career path started as a Data Analyst, then as an Actuarial Analyst. In 2020 she made another switch to the fascinating world of Data Science . She believes that data are stronger than opinions.\n\nTalk 2: Churn prediction model in Supermarkets\n\nAbstract\n-----------\nWe will present the process of setting up a churn model and how the findings are used in Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) environment to understand and treat ‘outlying’ customers in the general concept of increasing the turnover\n\nAbout the Speaker\n-------------------------\nAndreas Nearchou is a Data Scientist at Retailzoom for more than 2 years. His educational background comes from Mathematics and Statistics and he loves to code. Whatever is processed more than once, is definitely something to automate! He is handling a lot of data for a lot of countries that Retailzoom is present, using various techniques and methods to ensure a smooth workflow.\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.
