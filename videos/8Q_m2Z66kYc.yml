title: 'Best of Strata Santa Clara 2013: SQL on Hadoop Defining the New Generation of Analytic Databases'
recordingDate: 1381188759
description: "In this talk we will discuss the unavoidable cost and performance limitations of the connector-based approach employed by many established vendors and explain the long-term significance of Apache Hive's data model along with its influence on next generation SQL-on-Hadoop databases. We will then unravel the novel architectural features common to next generation analytic database systems like CitusDB and Impala that make real-time SQL-on-Hadoop feasible. Finally, we will conclude by reviewing several important database lessons learned over the previous decades that remain relevant today. \n\nAbout Carl Steinbach\n\nCarl Steinbach is a software engineer at Citus Data, as well as a committer and PMC member on the Apache Hive project.
