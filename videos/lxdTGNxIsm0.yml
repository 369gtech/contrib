title: 'GopherCon 2020: Zac Staples - Go Make Something Real â€“ The Potential for Go on the Factory Floor'
language: English
recordingDate: 1608669711
description: 'Imagine a world where adding a product to a factory is simple like adding an app to a phone; or think of an electrical utility that safely downloads software updates to save fuel and reduce emissions.  This type of DevOps to the industrial edge does not happen today because process control computers and communications protocols deployed in the majority of factories and critical infrastructure do not support a DevOps workflow. However, strong type safety, fast execution speed, and goroutines are creating a new approach to secure industrial automation that puts Go to work in a whole new world. This is a long way from internet backend infrastructure where Go began and Fathom5 is actively deploying Go microservice architectures in heavy industrial environments. This talk will present our experience with three specific use cases of Go integrated into industrial systems to provide new paradigms for secure automation.'
