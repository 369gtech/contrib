description: "Think your business could make use of Google's machine learning expertise when it comes to powering and improving your business applications, but you get stuck on building and training your own custom model? Google Cloud Platform (GCP) offers five APIs: Google Cloud Vision API, Cloud Speech API, Cloud Natural Language API, Cloud Translation API, and Cloud Video Intelligence API. These APIs access pre-trained machine learning models with a single API call. In this video, Sara Robinson shares an overview of each API. Then she dives into code with a live demo.\n\nCheck out the ‘All Sessions’ playlist for the rest of the talks that were given at GDD Europe ’17: https://goo.gl/6BFfHv\nSubscribe to the Google Developers channel: http://goo.gl/mQyv5L"
