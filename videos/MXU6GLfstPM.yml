description: "PyData Cyprus Meetup - September 2021\n\nTitle\n------\nApplying network science to project management\n\nAbstract\n------------\nLarge complex projects have become the norm in several industries over the last few decades. However, only about 7% of all projects worldwide are delivered without schedule or cost overruns. Nodes & Links, a young tech start-up, aims at improving project performance by making use of the large amounts of data collected throughout the lifetime of complex projects. In this talk, I'll present a few real-world problems that arise within such large-scale projects and demonstrate how network science can be used to tackle these challenging issues and contribute to a project's successful delivery. In contrast to modern trends, the approach adopted at Nodes & Links employs complexity science rather than black-box-style artificial intelligence tools in order to analyse the data and reach useful conclusions for the practitioner.\n\nAbout the Speaker\n--------------------------\nKostas Sakellariou is a Data Scientist at Nodes & Links, a VC-backed start-up (founded at Enterpreneur First in London) producing business intelligence solutions for complex (mega-)project management. Kostas holds a doctorate in Applied Mathematics from the University of Western Australia, a Master of Science by Research from the University of Oxford and a BSc in Mathematics from Imperial College London. Before joining N&L, Kostas worked as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of New South Wales in Sydney on detection of coherent sets (e.g. ocean eddies) in Lagrangian fluid flows (e.g. ocean) from positional data (e.g. Argo floats). His area of expertise revolves around complex systems, in particular nonlinear dynamics, network science, spectral analysis, ergodic theory and time series analysis."
