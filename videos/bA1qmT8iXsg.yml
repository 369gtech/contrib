description: "Mistakes were made - Patterns & Anti-Patterns For Effective Feature Flagging\n\nFeature flags are a valuable DevOps technique to deliver better, more reliable software faster. Feature flags can be used for both release management (dark launches, canary rollouts, betas) as well as long term control (entitlement management, user segmentation personalization). However, if not managed properly, feature flags can be very destructive technical debt. We'll discuss patterns & anti-patterns for effective feature flag management.\n\nEdith is CEO & cofounder of LaunchDarkly, the leading feature management platform. She has 15+ years of experience in product, engineering and marketing with both consumer and enterprise startups. She co-hosts \"To Be Continuous\" podcast with Paul Biggar, CircleCI founder. She was Product Director at TripIt, where she launched TripIt for Business and ExpenseIt. She holds two patents in deployment.
