description: "With the widespread use of wireless Internet access, we see that the use of portable technologies is rapidly increasing. Increasing public networks and facilitating access to these networks have attracted the attention of attackers. Due to easy availability of mature honeypot creation tools, this attack is a slam dunk for even the most novice of Wi-Fi attackers. Enterprise security products have tried but failed to solve this problem with rule and lockdown based approaches. In this talk, we are going to tell a story experienced about Wi-Fi network attackers. We will practically demonstrate how using new detection and deception techniques we can make Wi-Fi clients and environmentally secure.\n\nBesim Altinok (Twitter: @AltnokBesim) has been researching Wi-Fi security for over a decade. He created WiPi-Hunter project against Wi-Fi hackers. He is the author of a book on Wi-Fi security. Besim's work on wireless security has been published in ArkaKapi Magazine and others. He has also spoken at top conferences including BlackHat Europe, ASIA, Defcon, and others. Besim ALTINOK works currently at BARIKAT Internet Security in Turkey. Besim also founded Pentester Training project.\n\nCan Kurnaz (Twitter: @0x43414e) is conducting penetration tests from internet and internal networks to web-based applications, network infrastructures, wireless devices, IoT devices and operational technology infrastructures such as ICS/SCADA systems and components."
