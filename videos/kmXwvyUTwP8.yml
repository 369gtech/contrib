recordingDate: 1424550539
description: "To get value out of today’s big and fast data, organizations must evolve beyond traditional analytic cycles that are heavy with data transformation and schema management. The Hadoop revolution is about merging business analytics and production operations to create the ‘as-it-happens’ business. It’s not a matter of running a few queries to gain insight to make the next business decision but, to change the organization’s fundamental metabolic rate. It is essential to take a data centric approach to infrastructure to provide flexible, real-time data access, collapsing data silos and automating data-to-action for immediate operational benefits.\n\nThis session is sponsored by MapR Technologies.\n\nAbout Anil Gadre (MapR):\nAnil Gadre is the SVP of Product Management at MapR.
