However, since the Standard C++ Language and Library specification does not specify a user interface library, it's actually quite challenging given that the two leading mobile platforms provide non-C++ User Interface APIs. Even more challenging is the new world of mobile devices and the myriad form factors, layouts, resolutions, sensors, and services that an application developer has to deal with. Plus, the deployment model for remote devices makes testing UI changes slower due to the increased build and turnaround time. This session will describe how C++ can be used effectively for multi-device UI development and also deliver a rapid prototyping experience to minimize the deployment time to the device for testing.\n--\nJohn \"JT\" Thomas, Director of Product Management at Embarcadero Technologies, has more than 15 years of product management and product development experience including hands-on experience with the early versions of Delphi and C++Builder at Borland Software. Previously, JT held product management positions at mobile Linux vendor MontaVista Software and at Research in Motion. He earned his Computer Science degree from University of California, Santa Cruz and his MBA and MSE from San Jose State University.Website: http://www.embarcadero.comTwitter handle: @FireMonkeyPM\n--\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
