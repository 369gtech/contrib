description: "f(by) 2020\nFP track\n\nMaking another DSL in Haskell: case study - Maxim Koltsov @maksbotan\n\nIn this talk we'll present latest additions to Biocad's Haskell DSL for Cypher query language.\nCypher is the query language of Neo4j graph database. To make writing of complex queries safe and future-proof, we use our own embedding of Cypher into Haskell.\nWe will show how we applied several well-known techniques, like Generics, Type Families and heterogeneous lists, to make GHC check more of Cypher's syntax and semantics for us.\nIdeas presented in this talk are universal and will be useful in making any similar DSL in Haskell.\n\nGeneral Partner - Evolution Gaming https://eng.evolutiongaming.com/"
