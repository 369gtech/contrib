title: 'Extend Flink to edge computing with much lower footprint - Youjun Yuan'
recordingDate: 1588246408
description: 'Running Flink on resource constrained edge devices is hard. There are two major obstacles: a) It consumes too much memory; b) Deploying a Flink cluster on remote device is not easy. This talk we will present a lightweight runtime implementation of Flink, which lowers down the memory consumption of the framework below 10 MB; Jobs are statically compiled to native binary, and can be run independently without any dependency, easy to deploy.'
