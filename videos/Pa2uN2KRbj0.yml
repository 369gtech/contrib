description: "While React Native leverages the platforms native API and user interface elements to build mobile applications, transfer of control between the various layers could sometimes come at the cost of performance. \nIn this talk, we will look at the various tips and tricks for taking full advantage of React Native and using the performance attributes of the new architecture. \n\nWe will start by adding instrumentation to a sample application across the Javascript, Java/ObjC and C++ layers. Next, we will look at how this information can be used to improve at specific places in the render process. Finally, we will look at rounding up our performance practices by adding this to our CI system to ensure that the apps we build with React Native stay smooth and blazing fast.\n\nEVENT:\n\nChain React 2019\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nRam Narasimhan\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\n\nConference Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nInfinite Red YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwpSzVt7QpLDbCnPXqR97-g"
