recordingDate: 1492682126
description: "After the initial excitement of .NET Core wore off (Cross platform! Open source!), we realised there were a few things missing. APIs, mostly.\nOh, and compatibility with a lot of your favourite libraries and packages. Fortunately, the .NET Standard is here to fix all of this, adding back APIs, restoring compatibility and even replacing PCLs. This talk is all about the How and the Why, mixed in with a healthy dose of Why Should I Care. We'll even have a little geek out over the technical details. If type forwarding can't restore your excitement levels to fever pitch, I donâ€™t know what will!"
