description: "The Cloud Native Meetup Community A-Z - Moderated by Kaslin Fields, Oracle \n\nThe Cloud Native open source community is famous not only for the great technical capability it provides but also for the incredible community that creates and supports it. The Cloud Native community spans the globe but getting to know the community near YOU can be especially helpful. Meetups are a common tool throughout the tech world for people with similar interests to meet and learn from one another, and it’s particularly popular with open source communities. Whether you’re in Austin, Texas, Seattle, WA, or lots of other places around the world, there’s probably a meetup (or several!) near you. And if there isn’t, you can start one yourself! In this talk, container and cloud-native related meetup founders, organizers, speakers, and hosts from companies ranging from small startups to large fortune 500 companies will discuss their experiences with the meetup community. \n\nTo Learn More: https://sched.co/GrTN"
