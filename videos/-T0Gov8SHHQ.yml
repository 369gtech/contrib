description: "GraphQL is an incredible technology. It provides developers with concrete, solid guarantees at the API layer, preventing surprises when interacting with client-server applications. REST has been often criticized as weaker in this regard, since it is not a formal specification. This talk explores working with similar (if not better) contractually-sound REST APIs in a React application using powerful new tooling.\n\n\nEVENT:\nTalk recording from React Day Berlin Conference 2019 https://reactday.berlin\n\n\nSPEAKER:\nTejas Kumar\n\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nConference Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish conference talk videos.\n\n\nCREDITS:\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWO6U7jaO20"
