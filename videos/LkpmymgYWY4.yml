title: 'Deep Stream Dynamic Graph Analytics with Grapharis - Massimo Perini'
recordingDate: 1571155279
description: "World's toughest and most interesting analysis tasks lie at the intersection of graph data (inter-dependencies in data) and deep learning (inter-dependencies in the model). Classical graph embedding techniques have for years occupied research groups seeking how complex graphs can be encoded into a low-dimensional latent space. Recently, deep learning has dominated the space of embeddings generation due to its ability to automatically generate embeddings given any static graph.\n\nGrapharis is a project that revitalizes the concept of graph embeddings, yet it does so in a real setting were graphs are not static but keep changing over time (think of user interactions in social networks). More specifically, we explored how a system like Flink can be used to simplify both the process of training a graph embedding model incrementally but also make complex inferences and predictions in real time using graph structured data streams. To our knowledge, Grapharis is the first complete data pipeline using Flink and Tensorflow for real-time deep graph learning. This talk will cover how we can train, store and generate embeddings continuously and accurately as data evolves over time without the need to re-train the underlying model."
