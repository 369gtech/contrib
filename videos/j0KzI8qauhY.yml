In this deep dive session, we will start a journey from questions like “What is the Application?” to “The layers and phases through application delivery”, then all the way to the typical model and pattern of application delivery. We will use certain open source projects as concrete examples to explain how they fit into this model, their maturity level in each layer, what’s missing, and the direction the application delivery SIG  is trying to pursue. The session will help audiences figure out not only “what project X is doing”, but also “in what layer project X is working” and “how it performs there.” \n\nhttps://sched.co/WeWS"
