description: "In the microservices world, testing can sound easy since developers should focus in just one domain. In the real world, testing microservices can be tough as we also need to take into account the communication between the many services in our system. In this session about Spring Cloud Contract we will show its capabilities to keep producers and consumers working together correctly and avoid breaking the integration between them.\n\nSpeakers:\nOlga Maciaszek-Sharma\nSoftware Engineer, Pivotal\nEddu Melendez\nSoftware Engineer, Scotiabank\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
