description: "We live in the one of the highest ranking countries regarding gender equality. The possibilities are endless. There is nothing you can’t do if you try hard enough. That’s what I was told when I grew up and decided to become a programmer. So what is it really like to be working as a system developer and being a woman. \n\nAfter studying to become a programmer, Tove started working at IKEA IT AB in Helsingborg, where she worked as a System developer in a small pilot project where she got to be involved in everything. After that she has been working at Euroflorist, a couple of consultancy firms, started her own company and is currently working for Verisure Securitas Direct, the largest alarm operator in Europe. \n___\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry.
