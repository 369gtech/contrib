description: "Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) is a control system architecture that uses computers, networking, and graphical user interfaces for process monitoring and control, operating in conjunction with peripheral devices such as programmable logic controllers, sensors, and actuators to interface with plant and machinery.\n\nThe SCADA model was originally developed as a universal means of remotely accessing control modules, which could be from different manufacturers, allowing access through standard automation protocols.\n\nThe Internet of Things is now redefining the role and architecture of SCADA systems, with modern SCADA systems leveraging Internet protocols and cloud services for interaction with connected devices, and controlling environments ranging from smart homes to large-scale processes spanning multiple geographically disperse sites.\n\nIn this talk, we will discuss this evolution and will describe a novel next-generation SCADA solution that utilizes the capabilities of Erlang to monitor and control a growing network of industrial-scale energy-efficient temperature management systems.\n\nThe architecture and design of the system with be discussed, along with future plans to expand the role played by Erlang in the overall end-to-end solution and the use of the OpenVMS operating system on embedded devices to optimize reliability and security.\n\nOther possible uses for this solution and future enhancements will be considered, including making it more generic and more applicable to a range of Internet of Things scenarios.\n\nMore details here: https://codesync.global/speaker/brett-cameron/"
