description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nHow ABN AMRO Switched Cloud Providers Without Anyone Noticing - Mike Ryan, backtothelab.io & Laura Rehorst, ABN AMRO \n\nPeople often talk about being cloud agnostic, but what actually happens when an enterprise with 3000 developers decides to switch cloud providers?  In this session Laura Rehorst (Product Owner, Stratus, ABN AMRO) and Mike Ryan (DevOps Consultant) will share the story of how ABN AMRO leveraged the power of Kubernetes to facilitate the transition between cloud providers, and explore the strategic benefits of adopting a cloud native posture at all levels of the organisation.  Laura and Mike will also delve into the practical side to demonstrate how tools such as Helm, OPA, and custom operators allowed the platform team to abstract away the differences between cloud providers, and the “compliant by default” approach that keeps their security and compliance teams smiling.\n\nhttps://www.abnamro.com/\nhttp://backtothelab.io/\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zetm"
