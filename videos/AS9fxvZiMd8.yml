description: "Speaker: Chinab Chugh\n\nDescription\nJublia is a business matching SaaS solution for the events industry. A common challenge faced by us and this industry is managing different dynamic datasets of participant databases. That’s why we built Jublia DATASYNC - an easy-to-use data management tool via Google Sheets. I will be sharing how you can also build a simple-to-use tools for both techies and non-techies alike to manage databases.\n\nAbstract\nIn this talk, I will be sharing about the bread and butter of Jublia's Data Management Tool, which we call DATASYNC. It will focus on how we leverage on Google Sheets to build our own user-friendly database which maps to your SQL database. To do this, we decided to leverage on Google sheets because of its ubiquity and developed our own ‘middle layer’ using Google Sheets API to ensure our database is always in sync with the sheets. In addition to exploring the functionality of Sheets using the API, I will also share how we used Server-sent events on AWS DynamoDB to build a loading bar to communicate to the users when a 'sync' between the Sheets and database is happening.\n\nEvent Page: https://pycon.sg\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/P6SH/"
