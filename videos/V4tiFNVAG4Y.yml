recordingDate: 1541257469
description: 'Let’s talk about stuff that you are probably familiar with. Thread starvation. Long synchronize blocks. Unstable I/O. Cluster Leader election issues. That’s right - they are all, in one way or the other, problems with communication. The human-to-human variety. What else is a meeting than a synchronize block, pulled over our threads of attention? Whole project failing because of one person reporting sick leave for a week - broken service, anyone? Communication in real life has a lot in common with communication between threads. In both cases it is difficult - and should be thought out. Mostly importantly, though - there are lessons that apply to either! Why should I care, you might ask? Communication is not only a domain exclusive to PMs or architects. Those endless hours of meetings, or continuous failure to decide upon a solution - it’s something that drains your resources and slows you down the same way that needless synchronization slows down your code. Let’s talk about what processor design teaches us about meetings. Let’s see what developers and Java Memory Model have in common. Let’s learn how to design a lock-free communication, without ever touching Unsafe! Be warned - people will be called resources here.'
