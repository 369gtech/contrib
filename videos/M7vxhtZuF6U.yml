title: 'Introducing Tensorflow on Flink'
recordingDate: 1603796410
description: "TensorFlow is a deep learning framework, which is one of the most widely used frameworks in the field. Flink is a framework and distributed processing engine for stateful computations over unbounded and bounded data streams. \n\nThis video introduces the project Tensorflow on Flink, which will combine Flink and TensorFlow so the users can easily implement their algorithm with Tensorflow and run on Flink so that they can leverage the advantage from both Tensorflow and Flink at the same time. We demonstrate how users can implement their algorithm with Tensorflow in Python and run in a distributed manner with Flink."
