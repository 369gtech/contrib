description: "Jennifer Petoff, Nathen Harvey - Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) and the Art of SLOs\n\nSite Reliability Engineering (SRE) is a set of principles, practices, and organizational constructs that seek to balance the reliability of a service with the need to continually deliver new features. An error budget is the primary construct used to help balance these seemingly competing goals.\n\nThis workshop introduces error budgets and their components: service level indicators (SLIs) and service level objectives (SLOs). Participants will learn the art of creating and implementing SLOs through a series of guided discussions and group exercises.\n\nBy the end of this workshop, participants will be able to:\n\nDescribe the key concepts, namely, Error Budget, Service Level Indicator (SLIs), and Service Level Objectives (SLOs)\nCreate an error budget for a sample application or service\nCreate an error budget for their own application or service\nRecommend actions to take when the error budget is over consumed\nRecommend actions to take when excess error budget remains\n\nIn the spirit of DevOps, Error Budgets and SLOs work best when they are agreed to in collaboration with many different constituents across the business. As such, this workshop is appropriate for:\n\nProduct Owners and Product Managers\nBusiness decision makers\nDevelopers\nOperators\nAnd anyone else interested in building and operating services that deliver business and customer value.\n\nBring along your colleagues from other parts of the organization, a high-level architecture of one of your main services, and an appetite for learning and collaboration."
