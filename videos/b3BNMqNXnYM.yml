description: "Venkat Subramaniam, President, Agile Developer, Inc.\n\nReactive programming is no longer an esoteric idea. Many libraries and tools have started providing excellent support for this programming style—so much so that Java 9 has embraced this idea by including it in the specification. This presentation takes a dive into what reactive programming looks like from the Java specification point of view. You’ll witness the creation of a small working example that illustrates the API and learn how to make use of it."
