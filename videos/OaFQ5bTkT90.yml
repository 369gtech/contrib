title: 'Ansible on GCP: boosting playbook development process by Aleksandrs Zolotarjovs at DevOps Unicorns'
recordingDate: 1613505871
description: 'The writing of a playbook by pushing the code to a repository with each change is slow, inefficient and can cause a lot of issues during the execution as you may break stuff along the way. There must be a better way to do the work. We could use cloud environments to speed up the process. But this can become tricky, so in this talk we would go through a live demo using Google Cloud Shell and would make some dummy scripts along the way to make the development process easy, fast, and fun process.'
