description: "Many have said that Java has no future. But it is now 2014, the new java.time. *, stream-style and trendy lambda dances in Java 8. And a crowd of advanced neighbors?? that have their own means of asynchronous processing for 'going to production quickly.''\n\nLet's talk about other languages ??and libraries a bit. Buf of JDK 5, we already had Future and ExecutorService for asynchronous execution. However, with the advent of CompletableFuture in JDK 8, the way opened from callback hell to clean and more functional code.\n\nWe look at practical examples of the challenges CompletableFuture 'with streams and lambdas' takes and it's efficiency."
