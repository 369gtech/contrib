recordingDate: 1363628786
description: "Matt Ho, CTO at LOYAL3, gives us the who-what-when-where-why on Twitter's Finagle. According to Matt, Finagle is an expressive network library for JVM languages that's a lot like node.js for Scala.\n\nTo drill the point home, in this concise talk at NEScala, Matt compiles a bunch of examples and reviews the concepts that make creating complex asynchronous apps look easy.\n\nEHRMAGERD!!! SO MUCH MORE SCALA!!! http://bit.ly/nescala13"
