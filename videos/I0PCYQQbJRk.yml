description: "The 7th episode of The React Native Show is 100% focused on Re.Pack (https://github.com/callstack/repack) - an Open Source,  Webpack-based toolkit to build React Native apps with the full support of the Webpack ecosystem.\n\nThis time Mike Grabowski’s (https://twitter.com/grabbou) guest is Paweł Trysła aka. Zamotany (https://twitter.com/_zamotany), a software engineer at Callstack (https://twitter.com/callstackio) and the lead engineer at Re.Pack. Join them as they give insights into the brand new toolkit! \n\nIn the first part, our experts introduce Re.Pack talking about its origins, explaining how it works and why Re.Pack replaced its predecessor - Haul. They address the following topics:\n\n- What is Re.Pack and how does it work?\n- What do we need a bundler for, in the context of React Native development?\n- What is the biggest selling point of Re.Pack that will make developers use it over Metro, the default bundler?\n- What was the reason for building Re.Pack and replacing Haul with it?\n- What makes Re.Pack such a good toolkit?\n\nLater on, Mike and Paweł talk about use cases and the benefits of using Re.Pack answering the following questions:\n\n- Which Webpack 5 features can developers use with the help of Re.Pack?\n- What are the scenarios that make using Re.Pack a no-brainer? \n- How can modular apps, super-apps and mini-apps benefit from Re.Pack? \n- What can we achieve with Re.Pack and Module Federation? \n- What’s the difference between CodePush and dynamic delivery done with Re.Pack? \n- Single and multiple bridges in Re.Pack.\n\nAt the end, Paweł explains how to get started with Re.Pack, reveals the current status of the toolkit and the plans for the near future. \n\nGithub issue mentioned by Mike: https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/5#issuecomment-72348446\n\nDon’t forget to push the Subscribe button and share this video on your social media.
