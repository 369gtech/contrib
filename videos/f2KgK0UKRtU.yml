Both data sets are available from the National Snow and Ice Data Center. The WGI encompasses over 100,000 records of glacier data and the GPC houses approximately 10,000 digitized photographs. The online GPC has doubled in size this year due to significant updates from the USGS Ice and Climate Project collection and also many contributions by Austin Post. These updates bring photographs from the past to the forefront by enabling users to view Alaskan glaciers from the 1960s through the 1990s. The GPC KML files are updated intermittently. Because the WGI contains over 100,000 data records, a PostgreSQL database with a PostGIS extension was selected to store the data. GeoServer, an open source server, supports PostGIS and produces KML output automatically. By facilitating access to the KML files, data users can locate their region of interest and search for glacier data in a spatial context. The KML files are presented in Google Earth."
