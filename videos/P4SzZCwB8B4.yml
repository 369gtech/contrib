description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM SF 2020 - http://bit.ly/2wpn0SM\n\nGet involved in Code Sync's next conference - https://codesync.global\n\n---\n\nLEVELLING UP AT BLEACHER REPORT: A CAUTIONARY TALE\nby Peter Hastie \n\nABSTRACT\nElixir helped Bleacher Report grow from a scrappy startup to a household name. We saw gains just by introducing this new tool but to go further we need to learn how to master it. For self-taught programmers like myself that has meant learning some basic computer science. I will show how I applied data structures to get more out of Elixir. I'll also talk about some of the traps we left for ourselves as we were learning - and the horror of my experience breaking an app used by 3.7 million people.\n\nSlides & full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/peter-hastie/ \n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - PETER HASTIE\nLong - time Bleacher Report Survivor \n\nPeter is one of the longest standing members of the Bleacher Report engineering team having joined the company shortly after it was acquired in 2013. During that time he has had roles on the front-end, data engineering, and back-end teams. He currently leads the team of engineers responsible for the direct messaging feature in the B/R app.\n\nMore on Peter Hastie: https://codesync.global/speaker/peter-hastie/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM SF 2020\nCode BEAM SF is powered by Code Sync.
