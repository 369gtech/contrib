description: "Google Tech Talks\r\nAugust 30, 2007\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nQuicksilver hides almost unbounded power beneath the interface of a keyboard-driven launcher. Using a basic grammatical model, it allows you to move beyond basic search and work effortlessly with applications, data, and the web. Quickilver is above all a prototype intended to explore new forms of interaction.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will explore the motivation behind Quicksilver, highlights of its implementation, lessons learned from its design, and the ways it might inform the future of navigation for the desktop and the web.\r\n\r\nSpeaker: Nicholas Jitkoff  Credits: Speaker:Nicholas Jitkoff"
