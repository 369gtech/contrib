description: "They radically changes how software is developed, deployed, and charged for, and is in the process of further disrupting the still-evolving world of cloud computing.\n\nThis talk will present Fn Project (http://fnproject.io), a new Open-Source project, which features a code-first approach to building polyglot functions (ex. Java, Go, JS…). We will also discuss Fn Flow, a Promise based API, used to compose multiple functions into meaningful applications. No flow-charts, no exoteric stuff, just plain readable and testable code! Attend this code-driven session to discover the benefits of Serverless and Fn Project."
