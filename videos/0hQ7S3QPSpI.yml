The Zero X chassis is made out of aircraft aluminum and one of the lightest motorcycle frames on the planet at 18 pounds. The bike has a total weight of 140 pounds.\r\n \r\nThe Zero S street bike was introduced in April 2009. It was also designed from scratch as a high performance electric-only vehicle.\r\n \r\nMore info at http://www.zeromotorcycles.com/\r\n \r\nSpeaker Info:\r\n \r\nNeal Saiki, inventor and founder of Zero Motorcycles, Scotts Valley CA."
