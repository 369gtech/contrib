description: 'I built a library that helps you build UIs that render to pure SVG (no HTML, no CSS). It handles layout without relying on the browser''s layout engine, implements its own shape picking system, events, provides a scrollable text-wrapping component, replaces the browser''s input element with a new one, supports drag-and-drop, has a built-in dynamic layout editor, and is currently a React library'
