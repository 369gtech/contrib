description: "The O'Reilly Fluent Conference was first launched in 2012 as a new event for developers working with JavaScript, HTML5, and other web technologies. Now in its third year, Fluent covers the full scope of the Web Platform and its associated technologies, including WebGL, CSS3, mobile APIs, Node.js, AngularJS, ECMAScript 6, and more.\n\nThese technologies have become central to all kinds of development, not just building websites. If you're building web applications, designing for mobile devices, or working with the web's evolving infrastructure, you need to keep up with the proliferation of new technology that's driving the Web Platform.\n\nAt Fluent, you'll immerse yourself in learning. Fluent's speakers are people who are actually working with the same technologies you use—and inventing clever ways to wring the most out of them as they create products and services. Fluent offers a variety of forums for learning, from workshops and sessions with experts to the \"hallway track\" between sessions where attendees informally connect and share questions, knowledge, and perspectives with their peers.\n\nIf your business depends on JavaScript, HTML5, or other crucial web technologies—or the people who work with them—then you won't want to miss Fluent."
