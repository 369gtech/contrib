description: "Emerging from Burnout\n\nAmy Tobey, Equinix Metal\n\nAs practitioners at the edge of disaster, SREs live with high highs and low lows of emotional engagement with our work. We're also often \"swimming upstream\" to fight for our users, in organizations that often don't value reliability as much as we do personally. When we combine factors like oncall stress, misalignment of missions, and frustration with the status quo, it can lead to burnout, or cognitive injury. As professionals, we spend a lot of our time talking about important concepts like blameless analysis, inevitability of failure, and practicing towards a perfect that doesn't exist. In order to emerge from burnout, we can take the practices we use to make our socioâ€“technical systems more reliable and turn them inward, to steward our health and build resiliency. This talk is my story of (partial) recovery from serial burnout woven together with SRE, resilience, and mental health concepts the audience can use to both deepen their understanding of our profession, and hopefully, themselves.\n\nTakeaways\nOur skills as SREs and people who think about systems can inform how we manage our burnout. What we know about resilience can help us endure troubled times. Burnout is a real and potential issue that impacts SREs and some awareness can hopefully help folks avoid the worst of it and emerge healthier.\n\nAmy has worked in web operations for more than 20 years at companies of every size, touching everything from kernel code to user interfaces. When she's not working she can usually be found around her home in San Jose, caring for her family, making music, or running slowly in the sun."
