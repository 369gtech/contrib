description: "Google Tech Talks\nAugust 6, 2007\n\nABSTRACT\n\nMany online communities use tags - community selected words or phrases - to help people find what they desire. The quality of tags varies widely, from tags that capture a key dimension of an entity to those that are profane, useless, or unintelligible.\n\nIn this talk we investigate how users choose the tags they apply, and study whether systems can encourage users to create better tags. We also investigate ways in which systems can differentiate between good and bad tags.\n\nOur talk will be cover material presented in two conference papers: one published at CSCW 2006, and another that will be published in GROUP 2007.
