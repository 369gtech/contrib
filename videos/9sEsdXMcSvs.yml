recordingDate: 1493257820
description: "Bermuda is a British island territory in the North Atlantic, located off\_the east coast of the\_United States, with an economy largely based on international business and tourism. As the highest ranking\_population with Internet adoption in North America, the Government recognizes the value of\_having a strong and sustainable online presence to serve the Islandâ€™s citizens and industries, for now\_and for years to come.\n\nTheir mission, to facilitate innovation and technology, meant they needed to be able to executively\_engage with residents and businesses, share resources, seamlessly access a large number of internal\_applications, integrate with third party systems, and provide high-value services as efficiently as\_possible.\n\nThe Government knew that its existing portal was not meeting their needs. It was government\_department-centric and used a variety of platforms and methodologies to generate content. They were\_looking for a new approach. Based on their market research, they were looking for a citizen-centric\_design, with an emphasis on providing significant value to its residents and businesses, that leverages\_leading-edge technology to transform their business processes.\n\nIn this session\_Steve Lavigne, Technical Lead & Manager at OPIN Software, and Martin Walsh, Director of eGovernment at Government of Bermuda, will discuss:\n\nHow Drupal was pitched as the right choice over SharePoint & other\_proprietary systems.\nThe arguments made to move to\_Drupal specific hosting (Acquia).\nThe future-proofing plan;\_including the plan to move to Drupal 8.\nHow we proposed third-parties for seemless integration with existing systems.\nThe plan on how we intend to bring 100s of government services online with Drupal.\nThis session is for you if you:\n\nWork within the enterprise space and want to secure more business.\nHave ever struggled in suggesting Drupal, as the right choice,\_to an enterprise level audience.\nAre curious about how to implement a Drupal site within an organization with many moving pieces.\nAbout the Presenter(s):\n\nSteve Lavigne is a Technical Lead & Manager\_at OPIN Software, where he architects Drupal solutions and\_oversees the day-to-day development of many Drupal projects. \_Steve\_also works closely with the sales teams on all RFP responses and scoping exercises. \_He has 12+ years of experience developing enterprise level solutions and is currently the Vice President of the Ottawa Drupal Association. \_He has also\_spoken at many Drupal camps and meetups\_across Canada."
