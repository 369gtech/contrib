description: "Google Test Automation Conference 2010\r\nOctober 28-29, 2010\r\n\r\nTurning Quality on its Head\r\nPresented by James Whittaker, Engineering Director, Google Inc.\r\n\r\nAbstract:\r\n\r\nThis talk weighs the tradeoff between early cycle unit and component testing with late cycle integration and system testing and argues where the largest quality gains can be made by further investment in one, the other, or both. A very counter intuitive conclusion is reached and a model for testing that follows this conclusion is proposed.\r\n\r\nSpeaker Bio:\r\n\r\nDr. Whittaker is currently the Engineering Director over engineering tools and testing for Google's Seattle and Kirkland offices. He holds a PhD in computer science from the University of Tennessee and is the author or coauthor of four acclaimed textbooks. How to Break Software, How to Break Software Security (with Hugh Thompson) and How to Break Web Software (with Mike Andrews). His latest is Exploratory Software Testing: Tips, Tricks, Tours and Techniques to Guide Test Design and he's authored over fifty peer-reviewed papers on software development and computer security. He holds patents on various inventions in software testing and defensive security applications and has attracted millions in funding, sponsorship, and license agreements while a professor at Florida Tech. He has also served as a testing and security consultant for dozens of companies and spent 3 years as an architect at Microsoft.\r\n\r\nTalk Slides: https://docs.google.com/leaf?id=0B4fT-BFGDnQkMDE5OTk0ZmUtODQ4Ni00NTM3LTlkMGEtNjg1MTdiMzM5Nzg5"
