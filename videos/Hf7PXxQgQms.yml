description: 'I''ve been in So Cal tech for over 15 years having built, scaled and advised engineering organizations at both small startups and large internet companies such as Yahoo!, MySpace and Verizon Digital Media Services; most recently Signal Sciences. In that time, I''ve worked across a variety of office models relative to different remote environments. From Split Remote, Hybrid Remote, to Remote-First, I''d like to talk about my experience working with and managing teams in each as well as what I learned in terms of trade-off and challenge.'
