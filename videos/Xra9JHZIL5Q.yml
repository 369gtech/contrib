recordingDate: 1433784668
description: "Do you use REST and JAX-RS from your mobile and HTML5 apps to communicate with back-end services? Are you doing so securely? Attend this session to learn how vulnerabilities such as cross-site request forgery (CSRF) can be used by attackers to hack your JSON services. Find out how to develop applications that are resistant to such attacks and how to use simple authentication, access control, and encryption techniques to protect your RESTful services. The session includes live demos that show developers and architects how to secure critical REST services and stop hackers from exploiting their applications.\n\n\nAuthor:\nFrank Kim\nFrank Kim is the founder and principal consultant with ThinkSec as well as the curriculum lead for application security at the SANS Institute.
