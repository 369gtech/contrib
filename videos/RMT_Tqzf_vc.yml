description: "DOES19 Las Vegas — Is your company transformation falling short of your goals? Have you bought all the books, held the trainings, followed all the practises—but you didn’t get the promised results? \n\n \nIf so, it is probably your fault—there are almost certainly several difficult conversations you have been avoiding that could change your results dramatically: increasing trust, reducing fear, creating an inspiring Why, encouraging commitment, and ensuring accountability. The good news is that there are proven, concrete steps you can take today to start a conversational transformation that will address these problems. We will show you how to take the first steps toward a truly human-centred technology transformation using nothing more than a sheet of paper, and point the way to further development with techniques like Test-Driven Development for People and Directed Opportunism.\n\nDOES19 Las Vegas\nDOES 2019 US\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
