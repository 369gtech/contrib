description: "This talk is about how to secure your frontend applications using a RESTful approach. As opposed to traditional and monolithic server-side applications, when your frontend application is running on a browser and not securely from the server, there are few things you need to consider.\n\nWe will explore standards like OAuth or JWT to achieve a stateless, token-based authentication using frameworks like Angular JS on the frontend and Spring Security on the backend."
