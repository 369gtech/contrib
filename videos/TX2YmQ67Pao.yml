description: "Per-Ake Minborg\nCIO / CTO\nSpeedment\n\nCarina Dreifeldt\nCEO\nSpeedment, Inc.\n\nMany applications analyze large amounts of existing data. For example within the field of high-frequency trading, AI, IoT, transportation, health care, situation awareness or logistics. These analytics type of applications often require that a huge range of operations and aggregations can be carried out with ultra-low latency in a predictable way over time.
