description: "PyData Berlin 2018\n\nOn a fast growing online platform arise numerous metrics. With increasing amount of metrics methods of exploratory data analysis are becoming more and more important. We will show how recognition of similar metrics and clustering can make monitoring feasible and provide a better understanding of their mutual dependencies.\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/PyData/extracting-relevant-metrics-with-spectral-clustering-evelyn-trautmann\n---\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
