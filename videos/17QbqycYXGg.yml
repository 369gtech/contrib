He founded One.Tel in 1995â€”a mobile and long distance network operator. In 2006, Jodee founded www.PeopleBrowsr.com, a service provider of social media data, campaigns and analytics.\n\nPeopleBrowsr has built a 20 terabyte three-year DataMine of public online conversations and provides data, campaigns and advanced analytics to Fortune 500 Companies.
