description: "PyData London Meetup #58\nTuesday, September 3, 2019\n\nWhen optimising for multiple factors, a common practice is to reduce the problem to 1D, which, because of the limited search space, is likely to result in a suboptimal solution. In Multi-Objective Optimisation we consider a set of trade-off solutions, called the Pareto Front, as the optimal set, and by so explore a multi-dimensional space, where we are more likely to find improved solutions. Motivated by the challenge to empirically navigate the vast DNA combinatorial sequence space to discover therapeutic proteins, I discuss Pareto Front optimisation using Evolutionary Algorithms. In particular, I highlight DEAP, a Python platform for prototyping.\n\nSponsored & Hosted by Man Group\n\n****\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
