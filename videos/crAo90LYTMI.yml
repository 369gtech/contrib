description: "This session’s speaker has yet to meet a software engineer who jumps out of his or her chair in excitement at the thought of fixing one of his or her bugs, let alone other people's. It can be a frustrating task and sometimes  twice as hard as writing a program in the first place,  in the words of Brian Kernighan, who needs no introduction. In this session, you will be exposed to a more systematic and rigorous approach to debugging and will be introduced to several techniques and methods inspired by modern studies in cognitive psychology, the philosophy of science, and other fields. You never know—you might end up changing your mind about your favorite part of being a software engineer after all.\n\n\nAuthors:\nAbdelmonaim Remani\nundefined\nView more trainings by Abdelmonaim Remani at https://www.parleys.com/author/abdelmonaim-remani-1\n\n Maximino Gomez\nMax is a Sr. Software Engineer at Stanford Hospitals\nView more trainings by  Maximino Gomez at https://www.parleys.com/author/maximino-gomez\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
