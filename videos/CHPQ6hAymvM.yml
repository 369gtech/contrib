title: 'Database In-Memory and JSON Performance'
language: English
recordingDate: 1554309738
description: "Andy Rivenes (@TheInMemoryGuy) and Maria Colgan (@SQLMaria) explored how JSON is supported with Database In-Memory. We covered JSON support in Oracle Database, the use of virtual columns to improve JSON performance, and then showed how Database In-Memory can significantly speed up the use of JSON. We covered the use of In-Memory Expressions that are used under the covers by Database In-Memory and how Database In-Memory can also populate portions of JSON documents to further speed up analytic processing.\n\nhttps://asktom.oracle.com/\n\nOracle Developers portal: https://developer.oracle.com/\nSign up for an Oracle Cloud trial: https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/tryit"
