title: 'DIY Kubernetes identity provider. The Hard Way with Dex and LDAP. (Igor Borodin, Ukraine) [RU]'
recordingDate: 1545238964
description: 'The idea is to help Kubernetes users to understand basics of authN and authZ, OIDC flow, mechanics under the hood, and to show how to build production-ready identity management and audit log of Kubernetes clusters, combining tools from both worlds – the old one (LDAP) and the brave new one (Dex, dex-k8s-authenticator).'
