description: "DevOps and the subsequent move to bring security in under the umbrella of DevSecOps has created a new ethos for security. This is good. But, when things go wrong–and we know they will–are we going to be successful with the DevSecOps model, or will we be left searching yet again?\n\nIn an attempt to answer this question, we will look back in time over 120 years to unveil a tale that touches on business, engineering, and resilience. We will see how engineering decisions affect the lives of those around us and even though the world has radically changed over the last century, we are still facing many of the same root challenges.\n\nAlong the way, we will highlight the high-performing DevSecOps teams of today and introduce a framework for approaching DevSecOps in your organization. Topics range from empathy to lean to system safety with the hope to frame a new playbook for devs, ops, and security to work together.\n\nEVENT:\n\nGlobal AppSec DC 2019\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nJames Wickett\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed)\n\nATTRIBUTION CREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1qUUpOPY7I"
