description: "The feature we always hear about whenever Java 9 is in the news is Jigsaw, modularity for Java. But modularity just doesn't scratch the same developer itch that Java 8's lambdas and streams did, and as developers we're left with a vague sensation that version 9 might just not be that interesting.\n\nIn fact, Java 9 actually has a lot of great additions and changes which will make Java just that bit nicer to work with. These features can't be lumped under a nice umbrella term like Java 8's lambdas and streams, but the Java 9 changes are scattered throughout the APIs and language features that we regularly use.\n\nIn this presentation Trisha will show, via live coding:\n\nHow we can use the new Flow API to utilise Reactive Programming\nHow the improvements to the Streams API make it easier to control real-time streaming data\nHow the Collections convenience methods simplify code\nAlong the way we'll bump into other Java 9 features that make our lives easier, including some of the additions to interfaces and how deprecation has changed. As the application in built in real time, we’ll see that once you start using Java 9, you can't go back to Before.\n\nTrisha Gee has developed Java applications for a range of industries, including finance, manufacturing and non-profit, for companies of all sizes. She has expertise in Java high performance systems, is passionate about enabling developer productivity, and dabbles with Open Source development. Trisha blogs regularly on subjects that she thinks developers and other humans should care about, she’s a leader of the Sevilla Java User Group, a key member of the London Java Community, a MongoDB Master and a Java Champion. She believes we shouldn't all have to make the same mistakes again and again, so now she works for JetBrains where she can tell developers about all the cool stuff she's learnt so far."
