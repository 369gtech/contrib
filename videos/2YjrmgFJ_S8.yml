description: "We wake up one day in the middle of a real episode of Person of Interest, Black Mirror or George Orwell's 1984.\n\nHow did this happen? Who created these AI systems? Surely they should have understood...\n\nAs software engineers and data scientists we’re creating software where mistakes have a very high price.\n\nIf we’re not careful, it can cost people their jobs, their money, their privacy, or even their lives.\n\nIt's time to look at the impact we have, how our software will be used, and how we can avoid creating unfair, biased and dangerous software.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks, courses, and conferences in the following links:\nhttps://ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
