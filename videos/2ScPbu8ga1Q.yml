description: "GWT Extreme!\r\nRay Cromwell (Timepedia.org)\r\n\r\nIn this session, see Google Web Toolkit used in exotic and creative ways to solve interesting engineering problems, from authoring OpenSocial apps that run as both Web gadgets and native Android applications, to developing Adobe AIR applications using GWT, compiling CSS selectors to Javascript at compile time, running multithreaded code with GWT and Gears workers, or exporting GWT libraries for JavaScript users. Learn the secrets of writing \"faster than possible\" GWT code, how to use Generators and Linkers in harmony, and make seamless procedure calls from GWT code to other environments like Flash, Gears, or Android."
