description: "Presented by Wren Reynolds at JSLA (js.la) on Thursday August 27th 2015 - Apache Cordova, the free open-source engine behind PhoneGap, builds native apps from Javascript and opens up device features with a handy API. Taking the absolute essentials from a 3-hour \"Intro to Cordova\" workshop, this talk makes cooking native apps less like prepping a 5-course dinner with Gordon Ramsay screaming in your face, and more like making mom's spaghetti.\n* github.com/wrenr\n* twitter.com/wrenjs"
