title: 'Reading other peoples code - Patricia Aas'
recordingDate: 1554727888
description: "Someone else's code. Even worse, thousands of lines, maybe hundreds of files of other peoples code. Is there a way to methodically read and understand other peoples work, build their mental models?\nIn this talk I will go through techniques I have developed throughout 18 years of programming. Hopefully, you will walk away with a plan on how to approach a new code base. But even more, I hope you walk away with a feeling of curiosity, wanting to get to know your fellow programmers through their code.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com\nhttps://ndccopenhagen.com"
