description: 'We are going to look at some Grails 3 features that are maybe not so well known. With small code snippets and live coding we explore useful features of Grails 3. Grails 3 is based on Spring Boot and we take a look at Spring Boot features are lesser known, but very much applicable in our Grails 3 application. We take a look at profiles and other newer features that were introduced with Grails 3. The talk is based on the Grails Goodness series on the blog ''Messages from mrhaki''.'
