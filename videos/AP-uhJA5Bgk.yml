title: 'XProf solves All Your Performance Issues - Péter Gömöri - EUC17'
recordingDate: 1499852903
description: 'In this talk we will introduce XProf, an open-source visual profiler for Erlang and Elixir, a new addition in the spectrum between complex monitoring software and clever, command-line tracing and debugging tools. XProf was created to help solve performance problems of live, highly concurrent and utilised Back-end systems. It is often the case that high latency or big CPU usage is caused by very specific requests that are triggering inefficient code. All right, XProf won''t solve all your problems, but it helps you nail down and visualise these kind of issues, which could be pretty difficult to find in other ways. It is useful in both - ad-hoc inspection in order to understand blips and spikes - and also in long term, iterative performance analysis of certain parts of your system.'
