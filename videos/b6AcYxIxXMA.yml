description: "Recursion, Fractals, and the Python Turtle Module\n[EuroPython 2018 - Talk - 2018-07-25 - Smarkets]\n[Edinburgh, UK]\n\nBy Hayley Denbraver\n\nTo understand recursion you must first understand recursion. Alternatively, you could come to a talk that will demonstrate the basics of recursion, using fractals drawn by the python turtle module! \n\nWhat are fractals? Fractals are psychedelic designs that appear basically the same regardless of scale. They also appear all over natureâ€“consider how a tree trunk and branches is similar in structure to branches and twigs or how a wave is made of mini waves. Best of all, fractals can be constructed using recursive functions. \n\nWhat is the turtle module? It is part of the standard python library that can be used to draw amazing things and is commonly used as a tool for learning to code.\n\nCome for the recursion, stay for the amazing fractals, and leave knowing that no turtles were harmed in the making of this talk.\n\nThis talk is suitable for all python enthusiasts. Those who love mathematics will love this talk. Advanced developers will learn more about a tool that can be used to teach people to code. There is something for everyone.\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2018.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
