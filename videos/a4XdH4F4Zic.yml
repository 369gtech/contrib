description: "Pulling the Puppet Strings with Ansible\n\nBrian J. Atkisson, Red Hat, Inc.\n\nRed Hat IT (RHIT) has invested heavily in configuration management for nearly 20 years. Over this time, the configuration management landscape and strategies have substantially evolved. After standardizing on open source Puppet in 2008, we found ourselves with 500,000 lines of manifest code and tens of thousands of template files a decade later. We also were tied to a platform that no longer solved today's challenges.\n\nAnsible has proven to be a simple and robust tool for managing all aspects of modern environments. Application and systems teams were originally attracted to Ansible's natural and prescriptive language. We found it also easily handled hybrid cloud and application orchestration, in addition to traditional configuration management functions. This drove RHIT to begin adopting Ansible across the board.\n\nIn this session, we shall discuss our Ansible migration experience and strategy going forward, including the use of tools like AWX (Tower) and Galaxy.\n\nhttps://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa19/conference-program"
