description: "Talk \nThe Stochastic Gradient Descent algorithm is often used for online, large-scale machine learning problems but suffers from randomness in prediction. Weijie J. Su and Yuancheng Zhu provide a solution with their novel HiGrad algorithm that applies statistical inference to SGD predictions. This talk will explain the mechanics of HiGrad and demonstrate its implementation in Python.\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
