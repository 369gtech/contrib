title: 'Demin Yin. Building High-Performance Application Servers with Swoole'
language: English
recordingDate: 1620021881
description: "PHP is an excellent choice to build HTTP/1 applications, but it has limitations when building other server-side applications like HTTP/2, WebSocket, RPC, and UDP servers. In this talk, I will talk about how to build high-performance application servers with the PHP extension Swoole; how to implement challenging features like resource pooling, non-blocking I/O, task handling and scheduling; and how to develop, debug, test, deploy, and monitor these applications. Various real-life use cases will be studied during the talk. NOTE: This talk was accepted by Sunshine PHP 2020 and php[tek] 2020; itâ€™s publicly presented once only at Sunshine PHP 2020. \n\nPHPFest: https://2020.phpfest.ru/lecture/13"
