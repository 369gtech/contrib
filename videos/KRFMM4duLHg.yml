description: "Dr Pieter Abbeel got his PhD at Stanford University under the mentorship of Andrew Ng and went on to become a professor at UC Berkeley. He's worked at OpenAI, Willow Garage and now Embodied Intelligence.Drawing on recent advances in Deep Imitation Learning and Deep Reinforcement Learning, Embodied Intelligence is developing AI software that makes it easy to teach robots new, complex skills. I caught him after he gave a lecture at Nvidia's GTC Conference in San Jose and asked him some really quick questions about his life and his thought on Machine Learning. Enjoy!\n\nPlease Subscribe!
