language: English
recordingDate: 1450130811
description: "Nowadays Docker containers are really popular, and they can be used for almost any application. The common use case is to use Docker for DTAP environments, but why not use it on your development machine? In the speaker’s current project, his team shares a machine with several developers. That sounds nice until you have to fight for ports so you can start your applications. This and other issues can be solved with Docker containers. This presentation provides a quick introduction to Docker and then explains the different possibilities for running GUI apps within a Docker container. A demo shows the setup of the speaker’s development environment—including NetBeans, Java, Maven, and the like—which would be easy to customize to meet your own needs.\n\nSpeaker:\nJohan Janssen, Architect, Info Support\nJohan is working as a Java lead developer / architect and Java trainer at Info Support. He has been working for various demanding companies where rapidly delivering quality software was very important. Currently he is working in a DevOps team in a big financial institution in The Netherlands as Java architect. He likes sharing his knowledge about Java, continuous delivery, DevOps, software quality and numerous other subjects. Johan regularly writes articles and gives presentations about those subject for instance at JavaOne, JavaLand, JavaCro and J-Fall."
