description: "Daniel  Clifford\n\nAre you are interested in making JavaScript run blazingly fast in Chrome? This talk takes a look under the hood in V8 to help you identify how to optimize your JavaScript code. We'll show you how to leverage V8's sampling profiler to eliminate performance bottlenecks and optimize JavaScript programs, and we'll expose how V8 uses hidden classes and runtime type feedback to generate efficient JIT code.\n\nAttendees will leave the session with solid optimization guidelines for their JavaScript app and a good understanding on   how to best use performance tools and JavaScript idioms to maximize the performance of their application with V8.\n\nFor all I/O 2012 sessions, go to https://developers.google.com/io/"
