description: "Unik & Cloud Foundry Integration: Focus on IoT - Idit Levine, EMC\n\nUnikernel – an executable image that can run natively on a hypervisor without the need for a separate operating system – are rapidly gaining momentum. To integrate unikernels into the echo-system, cloud-computing platforms as a service are required to provide unikernels with the same services they provide for constrainers. Here we present Unik, a open source orchestration system for unikernels. Unik handles the compilation of libraries and applications for running on verity of cloud providers, manages their scheduling, and ensures their health. To provide the user with a seamless PaaS experience, Unik is integrated as a backend to Cloud Foundry runtime. \n\nIn the session, I will demonstrate and dive in to the integration details and focus on how strong the combination of CF and Unik can play in the IoT world.\n\nAbout Idit Levine\nIdit Levine is the CTO for cloud management division at EMC and a member of its global CTO office. Her passion and expertise are focused on Management and Orchestration (M&O) over the entire stack and on microservice, cloud native apps and Platform as a Service. Idit’s fascination with the cloud sprouted when she joined DynamicOps (vCAC, now part of VMware) as one of its first employees. She subsequently took part in developing the new-generation public cloud of Verizon Terremark, and served as an acting-CTO at Intigua, a startup company that focuses on container and management technology."
