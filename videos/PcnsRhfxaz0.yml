title: 'YOW! 2013 Sam Newman - Practical Considerations For Microservice Architectures'
recordingDate: 1514385655
description: "So you’ve heard about the buzz behind Microservices and finer-grained architectures in general? Microservice architectures can lead to easier to change, more maintainable systems which can be more secure, performant and stable than previous designs.\n\nBut what are the practical concerns associated with running more fine-grained systems, and what are the new things you’ll need to know if you want to embrace the power of smaller services without the new sources of complexity making your life a nightmare?\n\nThis talk will delve deeper into the characteristics of well-behaved services, and will define some clear principles your services should follow. It will also discuss in more depth some of the challenges associated with managing and monitoring more complex distributed systems. We’ll discuss how you can design services to be more fault-tolerant, what technologies may exist in your own platform to get you started. We’ll end by giving some pointers as to when you should consider microservice architectures, and how you should go about introducing them in your own organisation.\n\nI’m a techie currently working at a startup, whose members are scattered to 3 of the 4 corners of the earth.\n\nI tend to focus on work in the cloud and continuous delivery space, more recently focusing on the use of microservice architectures.\n\nMy book, Building Microservices, was published by O’Reilly in 2015.\n\nFor more on YOW!
