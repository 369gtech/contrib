description: "As your codebase and development team grow, being able to communicate how and why your code has evolved is crucial to your ability to continue to change it.\n\nOur version control history is a living, ever-changing, searchable record that tells the story of how and why our code is the way it is. The ability to document your code effectively using Git (or any other version control system) is an invaluable skill which allows your team to make informed decisions about future code changes.\n\nThis talk will outline some of the key practices which can be adopted to make your version control history tell a valuable story about your codebase, and how you can embed these practices with in your team.\n\nABOUT JOEL CHIPPINDALE\n\nJoel Chippindale is the CTO at FutureLearn, a social learning platform. He feels lucky to be in a role that mostly involves saying ‘yes’ to people when they inevitably think of better ways of doing things than he possibly could. He also likes drinking tea and is a member of the London Computation Club."
