title: 'Learning (and teaching) modern C++ - Challenges and Resources - Arne Mertz  [C++ on Sea 2019]'

description: "The complexity of the C++ language, which allows for versatility and good performance in a range of different domains, results in a steep learning curve and a reputation for being hard to learn and master. The rapid development of C++ with the recent standards C++11, C++14 and C++17 brings a challenge. What is modern C++, how can we keep up, and how can we avoid to learn and teach outdated idioms? The session discusses these challenges and then analyses the different information resources at our disposal, like books and different kinds of online content.\n---\nArne has been working with modern and not-so-modern C++ code bases for over 10 years. Since 2015 he writes frequently about modern C++ and clean code on his blog \"Simplify C++!\"\n\nhttps://cpponsea.uk/sessions/learning-and-teaching-modern-cpp-challenges-and-resources.html\n\nFilmed and Edited by Digital Medium Ltd: https://events.digital-medium.co.uk\nEnquiries: events@digital-medium.co.uk"
