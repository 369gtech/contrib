description: "Machine Learning Foundations is a free training course where you’ll learn the fundamentals of building machine learned models using TensorFlow.\n\nIn Episode 6 we’ll take what we learned about Convolutional Neural Networks in the previous few episodes and apply them to a computer vision scenario that was a Kaggle challenge not long ago--building a classifier for cats and dogs!\n\nDogs vs. Cats dataset → https://goo.gle/3g5mWdn\nExercise 4 answer → https://goo.gle/2ZhV6oq\nCats vs. Dogs example → https://goo.gle/2zTHWDu\n\nTensorFlow is Google’s end-to-end open source machine learning platform.
