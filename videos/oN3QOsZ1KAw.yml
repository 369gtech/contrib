This application will leverage Kofu configuration, a Kotlin DSL designed to configure your application in a functional way.\n\nI will also present various features currently incubated in Spring Fu project:\n\nKofu (Kotlin DSL) and Jafu (Java DSL) configuration for Spring Boot\nMinimal set of features enabled by default\nNo classpath scanning, no feature enabled based on classpath detection\nBoth declarative (via the DSL) and programmatic (code auto-complete, allow any kind of if, for statements)\nFunctional configuration based on pure lambdas\nMinimal reflection usage, no CGLIB proxy, no annotation processing\nFaster startup and lower memory consumption\nGraalVM native images support\nReactive SQL via R2DBC\nCoroutines web and persistence API\nI will explain where we are, what we learnt, and what's coming next in term of new Spring Framework and Spring Boot features.\n\n \nSébastien Deleuze \nFrom Pivotal\nSébastien is a Spring Framework and Reactor committer at Pivotal. He mostly works on Kotlin support across Spring portfolio, and on Web and Reactive topics. He is also part of MiXiT conference staff crew."
