title: 'Berlin Buzzwords 2012: Stefan HÃ¼bner - Introducing Cascalog: Functional Data Processing for Hadoop'
recordingDate: 1545060409
description: "Cascalog is a data processing library for Clojure - a Lisp dialect for the JVM. Cascalog mixes functional and logic programming. It makes data processing code very concise, easier to grasp and reason about. Being just a Clojure library, all of Clojures' features are just a keystroke away - no need to learn another custom language (like Pig or Hive). This also allows for powerful abstraction and composition capabilities. Live Demo - Parens abound! (This talk will have the style of a live demo. a 40 minute slot is appropriate. There will be a minimal set of slides, one or two Emacs buffers and lots of code - in digestible bits)\n\nMore Info: https://2012.berlinbuzzwords.de/sessions/introducing-cascalog-functional-data-processing-hadoop"
