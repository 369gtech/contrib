title: 'Centralised Logging    without the blood, sweat and tears   Paul Stack'
recordingDate: 1474617773
description: "Traditionally logging has fallen into one of three camps: don't do it, use an SaaS provider such as Splunk, or expend large amounts of time and energy configuring on-premise logging stacks. The maturity of cloud platform service offerings now means that you can have the flexibility of running your own logging stack without the headache and costs of managing individual components.\nIn this talk, Paul will demonstrate how the use of managed services like ElasticSearch, AWS Kinesis, and various log-shipping agents can build a scalable, easy-to-manage and cheap-to-run logging infrastructure that will ultimately save your company $$$."
