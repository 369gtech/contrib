description: "Architectures based on microservices have spread rapidly in the past few years. Organisations are drawn to the promise of independent evolvability, which allows to reduce cycle time and scale development. At the same time in many software solutions the majority of the codebase is now running in the web browser, which leads to an often underestimated challenge: the software design of the frontends. All too often teams have well-structured services running on the servers but a big, entangled monolith in the browser.\n\nIn this talk Erik describes a number patterns, harvested from practical use, that allow teams to avoid the dreaded frontend monolith, and build software solutions that fully deliver on the promise of microservices. The patterns range from the simple, using edge-side includes to do dynamic, yet cacheable, server-side composition to the complex, including an example of how to compose a React application inside the web-browser.\n\nEVENT:\n\nThoughtWorks Talks Tech 2019\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nErik DÃ¶rnenburg\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nATTRIBUTION CREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcQ1nWdb7iw"
