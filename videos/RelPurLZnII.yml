description: "In this talk we will give an overview of the challenges involved in deploying a Spring Boot app on Kubernetes. How do you deploy the web app and a database together? How do you configure your app with the database password? We will take a look at what's needed to deploy Spring Cloud Data Flow server on Kubernetes, both for testing and for a real production deployment. We'll also discuss using Helm for app deployments.\n\nThomas Risberg, Staff Engineer, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2017"
