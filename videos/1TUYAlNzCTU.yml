description: "RustConf 2019 - Is This Magic!? Ferris Explores Rustc! by J Haigh & QuietMisdreavus\n\nJoin our protagonist Ferris as they explore the wild unknown of the Rust compiler. With a little help from the locals, they manage to make a map of the various compiler crates, and gain an understanding of where each fits in the compiler. They also get to see where the locals congregate, and plan out their own expeditions. Eager for some extra hands, the locals start to teach Ferris the ropes of compiler development, from finding a good first issue, to setting up their own build, to testing their code. They even get some tips about working through the Pull Request workflow, to make sure their first contribution goes smoothly. Will Ferris discover the magic inside Rustc? Tune in to find out!"
