description: "Зал Сингапур, 8 ноября, 12:00\n\nПрезентация и тезисы:\nhttp://www.highload.ru/2016/abstracts/2446.html\n\nPostgres has always had strong support for relational storage. However, there are many cases where relational storage is either inefficient or overly restrictive. This talk shows the many ways that Postgres has expanded to support non-relational storage, specifically the ability to store and index multiple values, even unrelated ones, in a single database field. Such storage allows for greater efficiency and access simplicity, and can also avoid the negatives of entity-attribute-value (eav) storage. The talk will cover many examples of multiple-value-per-field storage, including arrays, range types, geometry, full text search, xml, json, and records."
