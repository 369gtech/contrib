description: "Attend this session to learn how the Netflix API achieves fault tolerance in a distributed architecture while depending on dozens of systems that can fail at any time while serving more than two billion Web service calls each day to 800+ different devices. Topics include common patterns, production examples, and operational learnings from the way Netflix incorporates fault and latency tolerance into its distributed systems, using circuit breakers, bulkheads, and other patterns embodied in the open source Hystrix library (https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix) and operates them by using real-time metrics and data visualization tools.\n\n\nAuthor:\nBen Christensen\nBen Christensen is a software engineer on the Netflix API Platform team responsible for fault tolerance, performance, architecture and scale while enabling millions of customers to access the Netflix experience across more than 800 different device types.  Specializing in Java since the 90s and through years of web and server-side development Ben has gained particular interest and skill in building maintainable, performant, high-volume, high-impact systems. Prior to Netflix, Ben was at Apple in the iTunes division making iOS apps and media available to the world. Open source contributions include Hystrix (https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix) and RxJava (https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava).\nView more trainings by Ben Christensen at https://www.parleys.com/author/ben-christensen\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
