description: "It used to be that AdMob publishers who wanted to use rewarded video ads were forced to use mediation to source their ads from third party networks. With the introduction of AdMob's own rewarded video demand, though, that step is no longer necessary. Publishers can load and show rewarded video directly from Google's network of advertisers with no third party SDKs or mediation adapters required.\n\nIn this video, you'll learn what makes rewarded stand out from other formats, how it can fit into your apps and games, plus see full implementation screencasts in iOS and Android.\n\nAdMob SDK Forum - https://goo.gl/MJfJ9N\niOS rewarded video guide: https://goo.gl/X4ttRX\nAndroid rewarded video guide: https://goo.gl/LAUzjV\nUnity rewarded video guide: https://goo.gl/6Yeqrk\nAndroid open source samples: https://goo.gl/9JNwCD\niOS open source samples: https://goo.gl/ssxSdA\n\nWatch more episodes of Mobile Ads Garage here: https://goo.gl/BDQvw6\n\nSubscribe to the Google Developers channel at http://goo.gl/mQyv5L"
