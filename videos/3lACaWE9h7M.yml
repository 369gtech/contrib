description: "\"Game Development with CircuitPython\n[EuroPython 2019 - Talk - 2019-07-12 - Boston]\n[Basel, CH]\n\nBy Radomir Dopieralski\n\nMaking computer games is difficult: it requires creativity, multidisciplinary knowledge of art, psychology, math, computer science, physics and others, patience, open mind and dedication. Making computer games with Python is a nightmare. You hit practically every sharp corner that Python has, starting with installation, through binary libraries, poor hardware support, up to distribution.\n\nPewPew devices are an attempt at solving the worst problems by giving you a dedicated, cheap, simple and portable gaming device, that you can easily program with Python with just a simple text editor. They also make pretty neat conference badges. I will talk about how they were conceived, how they are used, and how you can extend and improve them yourself.\n\nAt the end of the talk you should have a good idea about what is CircuitPython and MicroPython and how they can be used to build and program such simple devices. You should also know where to find the resources necessary to try designing and building your own.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2019.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/\n\n    \""
