description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nService mesh is a new pattern to build reliable distributed and decoupled applications, but often too complicated to implement with 1st generation control planes. Kuma takes a new approach to service mesh in order to build modern architectures across a large variety of platforms, including Kubernetes and VMs.\n\nIn this webinar, weâ€™ll walk you through Kuma, a new open source control plane for service mesh. Built on top of Envoy, Kuma can instrument any L4/L7 traffic to secure, observe, route and enhance connectivity between any service or database. It can be used natively in Kubernetes via CRDs or via a RESTful API across other environments, and it doesn't require a change to your application's code in order to be used."
