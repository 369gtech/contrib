description: "The Curse of Unreasonably Sized Networks\n\nAvery Pennarun, Tailscale\n\nWhat does IPv6 have in common with String Theory? How big can an internet get before parasites use it to destroy democracy? When you're building infrastructure, should scaleâ€“invariance be the ultimate goal? Can you give people a useful, verifiable identity without building a panopticon? Did you ever notice that Dunbar's Number fits comfortably in a /24? And what does NAT have to do with anything? We'll answer some of these questions!\n\nAvery is co-founder and CEO of Tailscale, which is the opposite of Internet scale, and it shows. His open source projects include wvdial, netselect, git-subtree, bup, sshuttle, and redo. Once, on vacation, he wrote a visual simulation of wifi beamforming radiation patterns. Nobody knows why."
