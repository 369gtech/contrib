description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io\_The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nBuilding Microservices Application: The Importance of API Gateways - Jun Zou, NGINX \n\nAt the heart of modern application architectures is the HTTP API. HTTP enables applications to be built rapidly and maintained easily. The HTTP API provides a common interface, regardless of the scale of the application, from a single‑purpose microservice to an all‑encompassing monolith. By using HTTP, the advancements in web application delivery that support hyperscale Internet properties can also be used to provide reliable and high‑performance API delivery. As the leading high‑performance, lightweight reverse proxy and load balancer, NGINX has the advanced HTTP processing capabilities needed for handling API traffic. This makes NGINX the ideal platform with which to build an API gateway. We will show how to configure NGINX to handle them in a way that is efficient, scalable, and easy to maintain. We will show a complete configuration demo, which can form the basis of a production deployment. \n\nhttps://sched.co/dINt"
