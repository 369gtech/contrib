description: "Mobycraft is a Minecraft client-side mod to manage Docker containers using Minecraft. This mod can be installed in any standard Minecraft client and allow young kids to learn Java and Docker fundamentals in a fun way. It allowed a 13-year old boy to apply his Minecraft modding and Java skills to pick up Docker concepts.\n\nEach container can be started and stopped from Minecraft. Similar containers are grouped together using color coding. Several Docker commands are exposed as new Minecraft commands.\n\nGuice DI was used to allow injection of multiple Docker implementations such as Docker Remote API and Titus/Netflix.\n\nThis project allowed a Java Champion and a Docker Captain father to have a bonding experience with his Minecraft loving son.\n\nArun Gupta is the vice president of developer advocacy at Couchbase.
