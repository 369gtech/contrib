description: "Domain-Driven Design Europe 2018\nhttps://dddeurope.com/\nhttps://twitter.com/ddd_eu\n\nHow open is Open Banking?\n\nOn January 2018, the Payment Services Directive II (PSD2) comes in force for all European banks. What this means for the banks and their customers and more interestingly what new type of players appear and what they can do?\n\nI argue that despite the regulation being poorly crafted from a technical point of view, it will lead to some structural changes in the industry. Moreover, I believe this is just the beginning of a “modularisation” process in financial services and new functional business blocks will be developed autonomously and separately from the vertical technology stack of the incumbent banks.\n\nIf you are familiar with banking architecture or not, I hope the talk will reveal some of the opportunities out there for starting new businesses in the new financial services landscape.\n\nBIOGRAPHY\n\nAndra splits her time between consulting internationally for large financial institutions and doing her PhD at the University of Warwick. Her research interest is in the modularisation of the financial services architecture and the development of new large-scale systems as complex adaptive systems.\n\nAndra built her career in consulting mostly with IBM and SAP and she has worked internationally implementing complex financial systems for large corporations and banks. For the past seven years she has been involved in the Fintech market in London, setting up a Business Innovation Lab in IBM, working as a Lead Solution Architect for the Innovation Lab of Lloyds Bank. She is an Anthemis fellow and a mentor for Startupbootcamp in London."
