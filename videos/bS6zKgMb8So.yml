title: 'CON2577   Down to Earth Microservices with Java EE'
language: English
recordingDate: 1449603117
description: "This session explores what microservices mean within the well-established context of SOA, when they make sense, and how to develop them by using the lightweight Java EE programming model. It examines microservices via a simple but representative example using Java EE. You’ll see how the Java EE programming model and APIs such as JAX-RS, WebSocket, JSON-P, Bean Validation, CDI, JPA, EJB 3, JMS 2, and JTA align with microservices. It may surprise you to learn that you already know more about microservices than you realize and that it is an architectural style that does not necessarily require you to learn an entirely new tool set. You might even conclude that Java EE is a particularly elegant tool set for developing microservices.\n\nSpeakers:\nSteve Millidge, Founder Payara, C2B2 CONSULTING LIMITED\nSteve is the Founder and Director of Payara and C2B2 Consulting.
