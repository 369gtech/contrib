title: 'pushState to the Future: Progressive Enhancement Using HTML 5 pushState - Todd Kloots'
recordingDate: 1390329443
description: "http://fluentconf.com\nOur pushState implementation is a progressive enhancement on top of our previous work, and could be described as Hijax + server-side rendering. It has enabled us to deliver the fast initial page rendering times and robustness we associate with traditional, server-side rendered sites and the lightening quick in-app navigation and state changes associate with client-side rendered web applications.\n\nThis talk will provide an overview of the pushState API, a summary of our implementation on both the server and the client, and details some of the pitfalls and gotchas we experienced along the way.\n\nThe slides are available here: https://speakerdeck.com/todd/pushstate-to-the-future"
