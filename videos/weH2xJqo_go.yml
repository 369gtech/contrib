recordingDate: 1413868326
description: "Thore Thomassen has a BSc in Computer Science from Heriot Watt University in Scotland. He started working as a developer and specialized in object oriented technologies. He was central in Storebrands development of a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and was also a major contributor when Storebrand introduced Agile development methods 14 years ago. He was part of a team of 5 people, responsible for adapting and implementing LEAN in Storebrand and worked as a LEAN navigator for 2 years. He has a broad background and has held positions as Business Analyst, Project manager and Enterprise Architect. 3 years ago he got the position as manager for the Business Intelligence department in Storebrand.\n\nLean, scrum and modern technology, tools to radicaly transform business processes\n\nThe talk will demonstrate how we radically improved a critical business process from taking on average 6 months down to minutes. The talk will demonstrate how we used LEAN as a foundation for identifying bottlenecks and from that derived a backlog of tasks. Using small teams and Scrum we iteratively delivered business functionality gradually improving the process execution time. A key element of the success was to think out of the box and exploit modern technology in combination with functionality in old legacy systems. The result was a fully digitized business process using an Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) to expose legacy functionality to modern open source web technology in combination with noSQL technology to provide insight and management control."
