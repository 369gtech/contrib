recordingDate: 1526140561
description: "Speaker: Jake VanderPlas\n\nPython provides a powerful platform for working with data, but often the most straightforward data analysis can be painfully slow. When used effectively, though, Python can be as fast as even compiled languages like C. This talk presents an overview of how to effectively approach optimization of numerical code in Python, touching on tools like numpy, pandas, scipy, cython, numba, and more.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2018 and https://github.com/PyCon/2018-slides"
