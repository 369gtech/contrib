description: "Video from Devoxx Poland 2019.\n\nJava is one of the - if not the most popular programming language in the world. And with innovative open source projects such as Graal, new languages such as Kotlin, ... the Java ecosystem just keeps flourishing.\n\nServerless Functions are hot and developer and corporate interest is exploding but let’s face it, Java isn’t the most popular language for writing Serverless functions — at least not yet. Can it ever be?\n\nIn this hands-on session, we’ll examine the challenges of using Java for functions and the latest features provided by the Java platform that address them. We’ll then dig into the open source Fn Project’s unparalleled Java support which makes it possible to build and scale out Java-based functions."
