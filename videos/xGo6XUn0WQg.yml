language: English
recordingDate: 1624351071
description: "Bluetooth® technology has changed enormously since its initial release about twenty years ago. Communication can now take place over distances in excess of a kilometre. It’s twice as fast as it used to be and connectionless communication through broadcasting data to an unlimited number of receivers has become extremely versatile and powerful. Oh and did you know, you can also create secure networks of tens of thousands of smart devices using Bluetooth technology?\n\nAll of these advanced capabilities are there for developers to exploit. By examining subjects like data rates, range and reliability, this talk will provide a guided tour of the most interesting and advanced aspects of Bluetooth technology and how they work, under the APIs.\n\nWe'll also take a peek into a possible future with reference to some of the latest capabilities of Bluetooth technology."
