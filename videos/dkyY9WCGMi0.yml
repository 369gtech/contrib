description: "Google Tech Talk, 3/31/16, presented by Ian Hickson\n\nABSTRACT: Flutter is a new project to help developers build high-performance, high-fidelity, mobile apps for iOS and Android from a single codebase.  Ian Hickson (Flutter's framework architect) will show why, knowing what we know now, we would design Flutter the way it is designed. Starting from an application that targets Flutter's low-level paint APIs, we will slowly move up the layers of abstraction reimplementing the application until we reach the material library layer. \n\nThis will not be a talk on \"what is flutter\" but rather \"how and why is flutter built this way\".\n\nTo learn more, please visit https://flutter.io"
