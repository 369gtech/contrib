description: "Your mobile computing devices use technology that was originally designed for accessibility purposes. There has always been a significant overlap in terms of mobile and accessibility best practices. Rooted in simplifying and optimizing interfaces, Responsive Web Design gives us tools that help us provide a better user experience. And while there is a cross-over between mobile and accessibility and similar philosophies between accessibilty and RWD, using Responsive Web Design techniques doesn't automatically make something accessible.\n\nMaking a Responsive design accessible actually requires a deep look at design patterns, layout, interaction and more. In this session, Derek looks at accessibility issues that creep into Responsive designs, what you can do about them, and provides guiding principles for ensuring that you're creating an experience that is optimized for everyone, including people with disabilities.\n\nAbout Derek: https://twitter.com/feather\nAbout Mobilism: https://mobilism.nl\n\nVideography generously sponsored by Mirabeau: https://www.mirabeau.nl"
