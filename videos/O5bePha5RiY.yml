language: English
recordingDate: 1621960427
description: "Azure offers a host of tools to enhance your machine learning work. With Notebooks in Azure Machine Learning (AML) Studio, you can now use this centralized workspace to conduct all your data exploration and training needs.\n\n\nIn this video, we will be walking through how you can develop and tune a python image classification model in python using the AML Notebooks. Along the way, we will explore exciting new data science tooling features such as code snippets, intelligent code autocompletions, and the variable explorer. We will also explore how you can use the AML SDK to best manage experiments in your workspace. \n\n\nGet started on your own AML notebook: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-run-jupyter-notebooks?WT.mc_id=devcloud-00000-cxa"
