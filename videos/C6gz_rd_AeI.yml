description: "https://media.ccc.de/c/asg2017/ASG2017-130-cyborg_teams\n\nHappy humans, tired machines\n\nn the Cockpit project we’ve done something amazing: We’ve built “robot” contributors to an Open Source project. “Cockpituous”, our project’s #5 contributor, is actually our automated team members.\n\nBots do the mundane tasks that would otherwise use up the time of human contributors. During the talk you can see them self-organizing, finding issues, contributing code changes, making decisions, releasing the software into Linux distros and containers. They work in a completely distributed, organic way, and run in containers.\n\nWe’ll talk about how humans are pair-programming with bots, and moving at a pace that would be unthinkable otherwise. \n\nTreating the bots as team members is fundamental to achieving this. I’m excited to show you how to pull that off.\n\n\n\n\nStef Walter"
