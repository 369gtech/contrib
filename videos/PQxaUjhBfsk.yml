description: "PyData Hamburg Remote Meeting / March 17 2020\n\n---------------\nTalk 1:\nðŸ“¢: Maria Perchyk, software engineer\nðŸ—£: Machine Learning with Embeddings\n\n Embeddings are one of todayâ€™s main concepts in machine learning. They capture the semantics of all kinds of data, such as texts, images and videos. Image classification and sentiment analysis are only two out of many applications. In this talk, I will show you how to visualize, train and apply embeddings for text and image data.\n\n\nTalk 2:\nðŸ“¢: Oliver Zeigermann, developer/data scientist (http://zeigermann.eu/) \n:ðŸ—£: Explaining Deep Neural Networks using Surrogate Models\n\nDeep Neural Networks are great for learning any form of decision boundaries and also can be made to generalize well. But with a lot of complexity they become black boxes and no one can understand what is going on inside of them. In this talk I will demo the idea of a decision tree as a surrogate model for such a network that gives you a dial between understandability and accuracy\n\n---------------\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
