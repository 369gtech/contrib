description: "Lana Brindley\nhttp://linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/20/\nSince the earliest people wandered the Earth, we have shared stories and fables\r\ndesigned to teach, entertain, and inform those who came after us. The only \r\ndifference between technical communicators and the Brothers Grimm, is the \r\nsophistication of the tools we use.\r\n\r\nTechnical communication used to be about determining what content people needed,\r\nresearching, and writing it. As the world has changed, and as content has become\r\nfree, democratised, and much more readily available (Google, anyone?) the \r\nproblem space has moved from \"what do we document?\" to \"how do we organise all\r\nthis?\".\r\n\r\nThe content generation model has been turned on its head.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, Lana will explore how content has changed through history,\r\nexplain some of the newest content curation models, how they are applied to \r\nmodern technical writing teams, and go through some of the challenges in \r\nchanging your documentation curation model."
