description: "This session covers the journey the Eclipse JDT team took to elevate the Eclipse compiler and IDE to the latest version of the Java language: Java 8. First it briefly discusses the new language features in Java 8 and then details the Eclipse features that were added or upgraded for Java 8, in both the compiler and IDE features. Along the way, you will hear about some of the challenges the Eclipse compiler team faced in implementing what is arguably the most complex feature of the Java language: lambda expressions. The session also includes a short demo of some of these features in the IDE. Finally, it shares some interesting tidbits about the Eclipse teamâ€™s Java 8 effort.\n\n\nAuthor:\nJayaprakash Arthanareeswaran\nI am the Component Lead for Eclipse JDT/Core and been a JDT Core committer for over four years.
