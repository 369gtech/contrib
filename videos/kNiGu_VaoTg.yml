title: 'Developing a Medical Image Viewer in ClojureScript - Oliver Eidel'
language: English
recordingDate: 1543521359
description: "Historically, medical image (DICOM) viewers were stand-alone software installed on workstations with serious performance requirements. They have to be able to process large files, holding the images in memory and re-rendering them at 30 frames per second.\n\nNowadays, the performance of JavaScript engines in modern browsers has improved significantly. Is it possible to develop a DICOM viewer in ClojureScript, targeting the browser? What are the benefits, the drawbacks and how do you optimize performance?"
