title: 'The Chuck Norris Experiment: Running Java in Any Browser Without a Plug-in'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433784669
description: "&quot;Chuck Norris can run Java in any browser—without a plugin&quot;. Find out what you need in order to reproduce Chuck’s roundhouse kick. In this session, you’ll learn everything you need in order to get started with &quot;bck2brwsr&quot;, a new open source project. Besides in GWT, the bytecode isn’t compiled to JavaScript but runs in a JavaScript-based JVM. The session shows you how simple it is to extend the capabilities of this project by creating your own APIs, which enables you to create maintainable applications by using, instead of JavaScript, a statically typed language with excellent tool support that runs in any modern browser. You’ll see a demo of building a Space Invaders–type game that runs on the iPad as well as Android devices. This is not a preview; you can use it today.\n\n\nAuthors:\nAnton Epple\nundefined\nView more trainings by Anton Epple at https://www.parleys.com/author/anton-epple\n\nJaroslav Tulach\nJaroslav Tulach is the founder and initial architect of NetBeans, which is not just a well known IDE, but also the first modular desktop application framework written in Java. \n\nJaroslav will share his API experiences while talking about API Design Checklist - a must have set of rules to follow by every programmer writing code that is consumed by another being.\n\nRegardless how revolutionary NetBeans architecture was at the end of last century, most of it is not slim enough to fit into small devices that rule the world today. NetBeans IDE (as it is) cannot fit into your phone or tablet. Still we want Java that is small enough to run on small devices, phones, plugin-less browsers and more. \n\nThe HTML+Java technology, as designed by Jaroslav fulfills that gap. It is a way to write business ready, yet slim applications once and deploy them everywhere!\nView more trainings by Jaroslav Tulach at https://www.parleys.com/author/jaroslav-tulach-1\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
