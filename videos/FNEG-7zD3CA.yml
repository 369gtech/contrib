description: "OpenStreetMaps for emergency prep: The view from San Francisco Using OpenStreetMap and QGIS to build resiliency maps\nby Stefano Maffulli\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/AW1.126/geo_osmqgis.webm\n\n\nIn San Francisco, the fire department offers free training to residents in the hopes that they won’t become victims the next time an earthquake hits. Residents of San Francisco, California are advised to keep a map in their emergency kit. What kind of map? People who take the fire department training class (Neighborhood Emergency Response Team - NERT) learn to spot potable water hydrants, gas meters, soft story buildings, police call boxes, chemical hazard warnings posted outside gas stations, car repair shops and construction sites. Until now, however, there are no maps with these features marked. This session will talk about the journey to creating these emergency maps  with my local NERT using OpenStreetMap. It will include best practices and lessons learned that can make this project useful for citizen mappers everywhere. \n\nRoom: AW1.126\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 14:45:00+01"
