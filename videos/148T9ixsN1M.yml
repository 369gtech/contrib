description: "Microservices all the thing! they say. Nowadays it seems that if architectures are not microservices based they are not worth the name. Is it really true? Do we really need a (micro)services based architecture?\nWe should design our systems with longevity, manutenability, and evolution simplicity in mind. Not hype. Long living systems are our primary goal. We'll analyze most common errors and we'll see how architecture can be a game changer in systems design.\nJoin Mauro in a journey that aims to disclose what it means to build a distributed system based on a (micro)servicesoriented architecture."
