recordingDate: 1580301575
description: "Caroline Pham, Roland Gesthuizen\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/241/\n\nThis talk will be about how popup makerspaces were used to engage members of the public at Monash University, Faculty of Education.  Rather than running a static showcase or demonstration, these events were used to actively encouraged participants to get their hands-on and minds-on with digital technologies. The presenter will outline some of the different activities that have been conducted over the past six months including Robotics, Virtual Reality, Coding with Micro:bits, Bee-Bots and Little Bit Electronics. This culminated with an engaging activity called LOSK in Space that was run at a local school. This approach was a valuable way for preservice teachers to evaluate new technologies, allowed them to explore new learning spaces and pedagogies.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
