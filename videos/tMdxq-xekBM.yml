description: "This is a tale of 3 engineers and their quest to bring Java to every Windows on Arm developer.\n\nWe will provide:\n1. a quick timeline of our development efforts and Microsoft's journey into OpenJDK land (spoiler alert: we were welcomed with open arm(s) (pun intended)),\n2. a few Arm64 and Windows nuances,\nour testing and benchmarking North Stars.\n3. If we feel lucky, we will even showcase a demo on our Surface Pro X device.\n\nAdditional Resources:\nWindows on Arm: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/arm/?WT.mc_id=events_jdconf"
