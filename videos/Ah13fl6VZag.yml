description: "We receive over 700 submissions for NDC London, all competing for less than 80 slots. Over the course of two extremely long days we lock ourselves into a small room and review each of them with an eye to creating the best agenda for our attendees.\n\nI'll take you behind the scenes of an agenda selection meeting and provide practical tips to improve your submission which will hopefully increase your chances of success. This isn't a selfless talk - I'm looking forward to more awesome submissions next year!"
