description: 'Most complex distributed systems happen by accident, as an evolution ofa design initially thought simple. Not everyone wants to be involved in getting the semantics of a distributed system right. In this talk, we''ll explore how a clever mix of Clojure, and Apache Mesos can help simplify and decouple the inner workings of distributed systems.This talk will give a short introduction to distributed systems and examples of infrastructure components that rapidly grow into behemoths. A mesos overview will be given to finish off with an example scheduler interaction with clojure and core.match for decision making.'
