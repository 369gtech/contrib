language: English
recordingDate: 1575916056
description: "Presented at Abstractions II, a software conference Code & Supply in Pittsburgh, PA August 21-23, 2019. Learn more at http://www.codeandsupply.co or https://abstractions.io. \n\nThe RAW CUTS series is comprised of selections from a few of our stages wherein the raw video was of high enough quality for C&S to release it before post-production. \n\nPost-production for a community-run conference with as many speakers and as low of a budget as Abstractions is an enormous and time-consuming undertaking. If you're interested in volunteering your time and CPU cycles to help with post-production, we can use your help. Email us at support@codeandsupply.co and we'll get you into the mix. You'll be permitted to credit yourself in the video pre-roll and credits and we'll thank you in this text and on social media.\n\nInterested in sponsoring professional post-production costs in exchange for your company's name and logo in the video forevermore? Contact us at sponsorship@abstractions.io. Opportunities start at $1,000.\n\n-----\n\nTeams building data-oriented applications against sensitive or large-scale information often face the problem of how to conduct discovery and work iteratively during development. Often, developers are cut-off from production data sets for security and operational reasons. But this doesn't have to be the case. You can build your system in such a way that analysts can work securely with production data, separate from customers, sharing their work, and performing quality control with real, live, production data. Save on operational overhead and complexity while maintaining security by moving your development environment to production instead of your production environment to your laptop.\n\nhttps://abstractions.io/schedule/#Write%20Code%20In%20Production-Sam%20Wilson"
