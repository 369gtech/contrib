description: "The future of Education is gaming, and in order to build that future we need to start building high quality, engaging educational games. In this tutorial, I show you how I built my first game for the Oculus Virtual Reality platform in C# using Unity. Baton Master lets you practice conducting in a simulated orchestral environmental. I wanted to understand the process of encoding real-world knowledge into game mechanics. I recorded a 3 hour screencast of me rebuilding it from scratch but i condensed it as much as I could to focus on the most relevant parts for you. I'm also releasing the code so please use it as you need it to learn, build, and explore the incredible world of Virtual Reality. My favorite VR games are: Echo Arena, Beat Saber, Big Screen, The Under Presents, Pistol Whip, SuperHot, and of course Half Life: Alyx. \n\nSubscribe for more educational videos! \n\nBaton Master code: \nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/Baton_Master_Unity\n\nTwitter: \nhttps://twitter.com/sirajraval\n\nLearning Resources I've been using: \n\nValem's Youtube Channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPJlesN59MzHPPCp0Lg8sLw\n\nUnity's native tutorials:\nhttps://learn.unity.com/tutorials\n\nReality is Broken by Jane McGonigal:\nhttps://www.audible.com/pd/Reality-Is-Broken-Audiobook/B004JOD9B0?site=3582&ref=101248&awc=14444_1596638562_11581eb41713443f479d55743ea359f5&source_code=AFNORBN1028159032\n\nBlood, Sweat, & Pixels by Jason Schrier:\nhttps://www.audiobooks.com/audiobook/blood-sweat-and-pixels-the-triumphant-turbulent-stories-behind-how-video-games-are-made/301216?refId=38712&gclid=CjwKCAjwsan5BRAOEiwALzomX8bvZ63bJer7qqOFOWNnmf6bAFJAKY4HYOQsl2SDsl_HUpJ6g-pB2RoC26IQAvD_BwE\n\nP.S- I've got at least 1 coding music video left in me."
