title: 'How Early Software Collaboration Created Remote Work - Victor Wu | PyData Chicago Meetup'
language: English
recordingDate: 1630334516
description: "PyData Chicago August Meetup\n\nIn 2020, the entire world learned of Zoom and videoconferencing. In particular, knowledge workers were suddenly all forced to work from home, also known as remote work. Within weeks, workers complained of Zoom fatigue and being disconnected from their coworkers, even though they were staring at them through their computer screens for 5 plus hours a day. Many companies soon discovered there was a “correct” way to do remote work, and a small contingent of companies were perfecting it over the past 20 years.\n\nIn this talk, I’ll speak on the beginnings of remote work, especially how it was influenced early on from open source software communities. We’ll dig into how people designing source control and code collaboration stumbled onto a new way for knowledge workers to work together, asynchronously across time and space; and how these learnings apply more broadly to the future of knowledge work.\n\nBio\nVictor Wu is the CEO and Co-founder of Ensembl. Ensembl helps companies make decisions faster by improving their communications cultures in the remote work and hybrid work pandemic age. Previously Victor was Head of Product at Tilt, a Kubernetes dev tools company. He previously also worked at GitLab and Grubhub.\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
