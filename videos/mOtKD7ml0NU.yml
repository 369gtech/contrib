description: "This video was recorded at Code Mesh LDN 18 http://bit.ly/2P7SPII\n\nGet involved in Code Sync's next conference http://bit.ly/2Mcm4aS\n\n---\n\nIDRIS 2: TYPE-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT OF IDRIS\nby Edwin Brady\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nEnthusiasm\nAbout\nTypes :)\n\n\nTALK LEVEL: \n\nABSTRACT\nWe've been having lots of fun over the last couple of years investigating the possibilities and limitations of type-driven development in Idris. As we write larger programs, though, we're finding the implementation of Idris is showing the strain - such is the nature of \"research quality software\" - and recently I decided the time was right to start again, and implement Idris 2 in Idris. In this talk, I'll give an introduction to type-driven development (in Idris 2) and report on progress so far, showing off the most interesting features which the new design enables (notably, linear types and better type inference).\n\nRead the full abstract: http://codesync.global/speaker/edwin-brady/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - EDWIN BRADY\nCreator of the Idris programming language; Lecturer\n\nEdwin is Lecturer in Computer Science at the University of St Andrews in Scotland, interested in type-driven development, domain-specific languages and reasoning about effectful programs. When he's not doing that, he might be playing Go, watching cricket, or wandering around Scotland's hills.\n\nMore on Edwin Brady: http://codesync.global/speaker/edwin-brady/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE MESH LDN 18\nCode Mesh LDN is powered by Code Sync.
