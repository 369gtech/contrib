description: "To solve real-world problems, it's sometimes necessary to run computationally heavy models. Properly leveraging parallel processing and other optimizations can save precious time and resources for training and inference. In this session, we’ll introduce NP on MXNet, a drop-in replacement library of official numpy for accelerating your workloads and opening your models to even more possibilities. The session will introduce the key features of NP on MXNet and give a demo how to build a machine learning model with this new package.\n\nIn this session, we’ll introduce NP on MXNet, a drop-in replacement library of official numpy for accelerating your workloads and opening your models to even more possibilities.

PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
