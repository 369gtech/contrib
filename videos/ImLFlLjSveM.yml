description: "https://cppcon.org/\nhttps://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2020\n---\nThe upcoming C++20 standard is the biggest update in a decade. Its feature set and their impact on how we write C++ will be as large, and possibly larger than that of C++11.\n\nIn this talk we will look at how new features like concepts, coroutines, and modules will fundamentally change the way we design libraries, the way we think about functions, and even the way we compile our code. We will also mention some long-standing warts in C++ which are finally cured.\n\n---\nTimur Doumler is a C++ developer specialising in audio and music technology, an active member of the ISO C++ committee, and Conference Chair of the Audio Developer Conference (ADC). He is passionate about building communities, clean code, good tools, and the evolution of C++.\n\n---\nStreamed & Edited by Digital Medium Ltd - events.digital-medium.co.uk\nevents@digital-medium.co.uk"
