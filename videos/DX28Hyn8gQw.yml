language: English
recordingDate: 1464358691
description: 'Front-end development is rapidly evolving, with new frameworks coming and going at a crazy pace. Among the many options, Elm stands out as one of the most original and promising approaches: it combines the principles of reactive programming with the elegance of strongly typed functional programming, yet providing a seamless integration with javascript code. In this talk Marco will introduce Elm, exploring a real project built with it. He will dig into the best language features, also exposing how Elm can foster the development of modular, reusable and testable front-end architectures.'
