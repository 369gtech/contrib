description: "I’m introvert. This can be bit unfortunate, when you are a person that enjoys spending a lot of free time creating fashion things bedazzled with LEDs… only to rarely wear them out in public. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ In an effort to actually share my weird and wonderful creations with others, I decided create a wearable project that would force me to be sociable in order for it to reveal its magic. In this talk, I’ll share how I used machine learning with javascript and tiny computers to make “fashion” that is responsive to the people around you and the attention you are (or aren’t) receiving.\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
