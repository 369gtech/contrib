Fidelity would like to share their experience focusing on the deployment and migration decisions (running two CFs in parallel, migrating applications with zero down-time, and the benefits of a single deployment mechanism). In addition, to explore the ongoing implications for the globally distributed PaaS team who operate it (increased responsibility, utilisation of the open-source community, and the change in workload) and ask - 'Is the platform sustainable?'\n\nhttps://cfseu18.sched.com/event/FRzD/from-commercial-to-open-source-cloud-foundry-in-the-enterprise-rachael-wonnacott-fidelity-international"
