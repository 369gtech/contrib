recordingDate: 1538394333
description: "Fuzzing is the process of throwing expected, invalid, random and unexpected input at an application to see if we can provoke it to crash.\nThis talk is will introduce fuzzing and especially fuzzing with AFL. Erlend will demonstrate how to get started, talk about some optimizations and issues you might run into while fuzzing, and hopefully get you started with fuzzing your own code with AFL.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences \nhttps://ndctechtown.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
