title: 'Lean Analytics: Use Data to Build a Better Startup Faster'
recordingDate: 1357134452
description: "Alistair Croll talks about his upcoming book, \"Lean Analytics\"\n\nThe Lean movement has revolutionized how we create products and companies. It focuses on customer development, tackles the risky parts first, and focuses on finding real, unmet needs.\n\nAt the core of this is iterationâ€”a cycle of learning and adapting that's driven by data. Lean Analytics gives you blunt, practical advice and proven approaches for learning from the abundance of data all around you.\n\nThis book is about analytics, done right: lean, mean, and iteratively. Filled with behind-the-scenes case studies and day-one tools, it's an essential ingredient for any smart startup.\n\nIn 2010, Alistair and Ben were two of the co-founders of Year One Labs, an early stage accelerator that provided funding and up to 1-year of hands-on mentorship to 5 startups. Year One Labs followed a Lean Startup program, making it the first accelerator to formalize such a structure. Three of five companies graduated from Year One Labs and went on to raise follow-on financing. A great deal of their experience and thought leadership around Lean Startup and analytics emerged during this time.\n\nAlistair has been an entrepreneur, author, and public speaker for nearly 20 years. He's worked on a variety of topics, from web performance, to big data, to cloud computing, to startups in that time.\n\nwww.leananalyticsbook.com"
