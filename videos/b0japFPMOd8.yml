description: "Norfolk Developers 2nd September 2014\n\nPhilosophers, Knowledge and Children's Television Programs \nDom Davis \n(@idomdavis)\n\nThe problem with AI, or Artificial Intelligence, is that it's meaning really depends on your definition of the words \"Artificial\" and \"Intelligence\", and is usually pretty skewed by the number of movies you've watched. Bandy around terms like \"AI for the masses\" and you're likely to get many different interpretations of what that actually means; all of them wrong. So we'll abandon the term \"AI\" and talk instead about knowledge, because we all know what knowledge means... and some of us may even agree on that meaning. And we'll talk about Knowledge Engineering, because it turns out that a discipline you've probably never heard of might just solve a problem you didn't know you could solve, and possibly didn't know you had. But first we'll talk about philosophers and children's television programs, because they're in the title and they're probably there for a reason. \n\nDom Davis is a veteran of The City and a casualty of The Financial Crisis. Not content with bringing the world to its knees he then went off to help break the internet before winding up in Norfolk where he is now a technology evangelist for a small startup. Dom is an enthusiastic and impassioned speaker [read: he gabbles] who uses a blend of irreverent sarcasm and flippant humour to bring complex technical subjects to ordinary people. Whether or not they understand him is up for debate, but he likes to believe they do.\n\nhttp://www.meetup.com/Norfolk-Developers-NorDev/events/184945902/"
