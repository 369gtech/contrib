description: "Panel: The Weeping Angels of Site Reliability\n\nKurt Andersen, LinkedIn; Ryan Boyd, Groupon; Pete Cheslock, Threat Stack; Mark Risher, Google; Cory Scott, LinkedIn; Jamie Tomasello, AccessNow.Org\n\nSite reliability is not just about keeping your service running, users clicking, and transactions humming along. Your service does not end at your network interconnect. Reliability has to include principles and practices of safe computing for your users, their data, and all of the other systems that your site connects to. Bake security in from the beginning to protect your site, your users, and user data from an increasing array of assailants: DevOps needs InfoSec too.\n\nThreats to the stability of a service can come from poor code, unreliable hardware, or bad network or power connections, but they also come from people who want to exploit the power and resources which you have accumulated to operate and grow your site. Hardware failures and other random acts of nature will test the abilities of your operations teams, but they do not present the same threat as a sentient enemy. And any site with resources of value will have intelligent, resourceful predators. If you haven't seen them, you are not looking in the right places.\n\nThis panel of experienced anti-abuse and security experts will cover the threat space for services, from fraudulent accounts to nation state actors who want your user's data, to scammers who want to use your infrastructure to wreak havoc on other portions of the internet ecosystem. Learn about developing a data security action plan for your site.\n\nJoin us for an adventure to foil the dark side, and be careful not to blink.\n\nView the full SREcon15 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon15/program"
