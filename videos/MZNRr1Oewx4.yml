Marjorie Figueroa - Accessibility, what why and how?\n\nProviding access to everyone is also part of our job, we create content and put it out there so it makes sense that everyone can use it, right?\nSadly this is not the case, the web is filled with unaccessible sites and we need to do something about it. Accessibility should not be disregarded or forgotten, it should be taken in account on every step of the way!\n\n3.
