description: 'We constantly hear that change should be affordable and cost effective. True, but, in reality, that is easily said than done. Complexity makes change hard. We can''t shy away from the hard problems posed by domains and business needs. So, how can we solve complicated problems without getting dragged into the quagmire of what appears to be an inevitable complexity? In this keynote, an award winning author and software practitioner will share experiences and observations from working on multiple software projects, about what leads to complexities, the traps developers and organizations fall into, and what we can do to effectively deal with these common, recurring issues we see across domains and products.'
