description: "Alex Sharp, Anuj Dhavalikar\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/127/\n\nSick of dealing with a networking quirks that randomly break things? Sick of dealing with dependency management for libraries that just won't get along? Sick of worrying about the latest Firefox 0-days?\r\n\r\nWorry no more . The future is already here â€” it's just not very evenly distributed. This talk will run you through an existing implementation of desktop containers using the Xen hypervisor, with comparisons to Docker and LXC. We'll go through what works, how it works, what doesn't work and what the future holds.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
