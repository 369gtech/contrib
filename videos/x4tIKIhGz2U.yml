description: "Formula 1 is a rapidly evolving and highly exacting engineering discipline, featuring constrained resources and constantly evolving requirements. Discover how the Software Development team at the McLaren Racing Formula 1 team has evolved its software and its processes in order to handle this challenging industry.\nSee how we deliver rock-solid software that performs every time in Qualifying, and contrast that to our proof-of-concept and bleeding edge development that only has to work once but is needed just for one weekend.Along the way, find out about the history of McLaren and our technical and engineering innovations; how Software Engineers fit into a racing team; and the critical roles we play during Formula 1 race weekends. Some of our software is used by 250 people, and some of it by only 8 - find out how we support them to the highest standards whether they are at their desk in Woking or in the middle of the garage in Azerbaijan."
