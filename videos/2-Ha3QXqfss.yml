title: 'Pythonic Code, By Example'
language: English
recordingDate: 1626731002
description: "We often hear the term Pythonic thrown around, but what exactly does it mean? This talk will take you on a tour of some of the more important pythonic concepts. You will see many examples of perfectly functional Python code that is quite non-pythonic. We will evolve that code into more an idiomatic form that fits better with the Python language and its users.\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).
