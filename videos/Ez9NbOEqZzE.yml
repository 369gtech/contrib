description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTOpia Chaos Engineering Day 2021. #GOTOcon #GOTOpia\nhttp://gotopia.eu\n\nAaron Rinehart - Co-Founder & CTO at Verica\n\nABSTRACT\nHope isn’t a strategy. Likewise, perfection isn’t a plan. The systems we are responsible for are failing as a normal function of how they operate, whether we like it or not, whether we see it or not. Security chaos engineering is about increasing confidence that our security mechanisms are effective at performing under the conditions for which we designed them. Through continuous security experimentation, we become better prepared as an organization and reduce the likelihood of being caught off guard by unforeseen disruptions. These practices better prepare us (as professionals), our teams, and the organizations we represent to be effective and resilient when faced with security unknowns.\nIn this session Aaron Rinehart, co-author of the O'Reilly Report on Security Chaos Engineering, will share how you can get started in applying the Security based Chaos Engineering to create highly secure, performant, and resilient distributed systems [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n01:13 The security \"Whack-a-Mole\" problem\n10:35 Security chaos engineering (SCE)\n11:25 Use cases\n13:17 Experiment framework\n13:59 Example SCE experiment\n17:40 Outro\n\nRead the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotopia.us/chaos-day-2021/sessions/1733/winning-at-security-whack-a-mole-with-security-chaos-engineering-security-and-chaos-engineering-a-novel-approach-to-crafting-secure-and-resilient-distributed-systems\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nAaron Rinehart • Security Chaos Engineering • https://www.verica.io/sce-book\nNora Jones & Casey Rosenthal • Chaos Engineering • https://www.verica.io/book\nNora Jones & Casey Rosenthal • Chaos Engineering • https://amzn.to/3hUmuAH\nMikolaj Pawlikowski • Chaos Engineering • https://amzn.to/2SQ5Olf\nRuss Miles • Learning Chaos Engineering • https://amzn.to/3hCiUe8\nMurphy, Beyer, Jones & Petoff • Site Reliability Engineering • https://amzn.to/2Vg6Mbr\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#ChaosEngineering #SecurityChaosEngineering #SCE #CyberSecurity #SRE #SoftwareReliabilityEngineering #Programming #GameDay #ChaoSlingr\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
