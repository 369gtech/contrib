description: "The microservice architecture is becoming increasing important. But what is it exactly? Why should you care about microservices? And, what do you need to do to ensure that your organization uses the microservice architecture successfully? In this talk, Iâ€™ll answer these and other questions using shapes as visual metaphors. You will learn about the motivations for the microservice architecture and why simply adopting microservices is insufficient. I describe essential characteristics of microservices, You will learn how a successful microservice architecture consist of loosely coupled services with stable APIs that communicate asynchronous. I will cover strategies for effectively testing microservices.\n\nChris Richardson\nChris Richardson Consulting, Inc\n\nRecorded at Jfokus 2020 in Stockholm 4th of february\nhttp://www.jfokus.se"
