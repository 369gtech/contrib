description: "From Zero to Cloud in 12 Easy Factors - Jatin Naik & Ed King, Pivotal\n\nIt’s no secret that Cloud Foundry provides an amazing platform to deploy and run your applications, and getting your applications deployed to the Cloud is as easy as `cf push`, right? Well, yes, assuming your .NET applications are ready for the cloud. There are a number of “rules” your apps need to abide by in order to get the maximum value from the platform. These rules are commonly referred to as the “12 Factors”.\n\nI’m sure you’ve probably heard of the term “12 factor”, but what exactly does it mean, and more importantly, what needs to be done to take your existing apps and convert them to “12 factor” apps?\n\nFor this session, Ed and Jatin have prepared a “0 factor\" ASP.NET/C# web app, one that is completely unsuitable for the Cloud. Join them as they transform the app, factor-by-factor, into one that is Cloud Native and ready for the Foundry. \n\nAbout Ed King\nEd is a Systems Engineer currently working on the Cloud Foundry Garden project. He has spoken at CFSummit Santa Clara 2016.\n\nAbout Jatin Naik\nJatin is a software engineer for Pivotal Cloud Foundry, currently working on BOSH Backup & Restore. He has previously spoken at Cloud Foundry Summit Silicon Valley 2017, Cloud Foundry Summit Europe 2016 and is a regular at the London PaaS User Group."
