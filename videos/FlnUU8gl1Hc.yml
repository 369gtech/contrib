recordingDate: 1620021865
description: "How many times have you heard about ReactPHP? And how many times did you plan a small service on top of it? Well, in this talk Iâ€™m going to show you from 0 to 100 how to build something production-ready on top of ReactPHP and DriftPHP, by using promises and an event-loop, some existing libraries and adapters, and by using the always needed and many times forgotten benchmarking-driven development.\n\nPHPFest: https://2020.phpfest.ru/lecture/1"
