description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM SF 2020 - http://bit.ly/2wpn0SM\n\nGet involved in Code Sync's next conference - https://codesync.global\n---\n\nINSTRUMENTING AND MONITORING STATELESS ERLANG TODAY\nby Markus Feyh\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nInstrumentation Monitoring Erlang\n\nABSTRACT\nThe tools we use to monitor and instrument Erlang deployments have changed rapidly. One of the difficulties many developers and managers have shared is a lack of good monitoring and instrumentation for Erlang. In this talk, I will talk about a journey towards a standardized stack of tools for monitoring and instrumentation for stateless Erlang deployments. Are you facing questions about whether your DB, application logic or networking is creating latency? Are you wondering how many requests you getting and which requests take the longest?\n\nSlides & full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/markus-feyh/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - MARKUS FEYH\nBattle tested erlang developer who wants to share his experience about monitoring and instrumenting stateless erlang deployments.\n\nMarkus has been working with Erlang for 7 years and learned Erlang in Sweden from Francesco Cesarini. Always seeking to find a way to combine delivering value with the strengths of Erlang, his career has taken him through payments, social networks and healthcare.\n\nMore on Markus Feyh: https://codesync.global/speaker/markus-feyh/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM SF 2020\nCode BEAM SF is powered by Code Sync.
