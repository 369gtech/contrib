description: "Check out https://g.co/aiexperiments to learn more.\n\nBird sounds vary widely. This experiment uses machine learning to organize thousands of bird sounds. The computer wasn’t given tags or the birds’ names – only the audio. Using a technique called t-SNE, the computer created this map, where similar sounds are placed closer together. http://g.co/aiexperiments\n\nBuilt by Kyle McDonald, Manny Tan, Yotam Mann, and friends at Google Creative Lab. Thanks to Cornell Lab of Ornithology for their support. The sounds are available in the Macaulay Library’s Essential Set for North America. t-SNE animation featured in video by Gene Kogan.\n\nMore resources:\nhttps://github.com/lvdmaaten/bhtsne\nhttp://www.birds.cornell.edu\nhttp://macaulaylibrary.org\nhttp://ml4a.github.io"
