description: "Anand Kothari, Senior Director, Product Management, Oracle\n\nVenkat Vengala, Oracle\n\nThe world is going “real-time” and constantly producing what’s popularly known as streaming data, which falls somewhere in the middle of request/response and (offline) batch systems. Think about the millions of events flowing in per second. How would your applications consume and process the data and make the insights readily available to end users and other systems in real time—all this in a low-latency, large-scale, fault-tolerant manner? This demands a new kind of architecture, and a niche breed of distributed platforms has sprung up to tackle these problems. In this session, the speakers present their take on building such a system with Apache Kafka, Kafka Streams, and Redis."
