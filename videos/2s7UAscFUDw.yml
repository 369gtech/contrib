description: "Integrating Google Maps API services into applications provides a great set of location based services for powerful functionality. If you write server side applications in Java or Python, accessing these APIs requires some way to talk to the Google Maps server REST APIs that provide the interfaces.\n\nGoogle have built an open-source set of client libraries that take care of all the nitty-gritty detail of connecting, and managing Maps API services for both Java and Python.\n\nAlex Danilo introduces these libraries, and what they do  - allowing Java and Python server side application developers to save time integrating Maps API services into their applications.\n\nThese libraries streamline and simplify the work required to get an application up and running by taking care of things like retry for dropped connections, rate limiting to make sure applications manage their quota, and more.\n\nDocumentation for the client libraries is on the Google Developers Site here, and the open source project code is on github here.\n\nIf you develop in Java or Python, you should definitely take a look.\n\n#googlemaps"
