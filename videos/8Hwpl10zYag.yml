description: "LIVE STREAM – Meet the Experts: DDD revisited in the Cloud Native Age with Vaughn Vernon\n\nAs the nervous system of almost every business process, IT must be available all the time. There is hardly any process, product or business feature that could be changed without touching software. IT must make it possible to bring new ideas and requirements to the customer faster and in a more flexible way than ever. In times of high demands for speed and availability, Cloud Native technologies seem to be the right response.\n\nYet, more complexity also requires more coordination and transparency. Luckily, Domain-driven Design (DDD) has come to the rescue. It strives to model complex software by promoting closer coordination between departments and software users and a better approach to developing critical software. But is it really the holy grail to tackle the challenges of Cloud Native software development?\n\nAt our one-day event “Meet the Experts: DDD revisited in the Cloud Native Age”, we will take an in-depth look at DDD in the Cloud Native context, highlighting trends, topics, and technologies in the area of DDD. We are happy to be joined by Vaughn Vernon, one of the leading experts in Domain-driven Design.\n\nAGENDA OF THE DAY\n\n9.30-9.45 Welcome\n9.45-10.30 Embedding DDD in the context of the Cloud Native Age (Benjamin Nothdurft)\n10.30-11.15 The Power of Event Storming (Benjamin Nothdurft)\n11.15-11.30 Coffee break\n11.30-12.15 Domain-driven Design and Strategic Design Through the Looking Glass (Eberhard Wolff)\n12.15-13.15 Lunch break\n13.15-14.45 Functional Programming and Domain-driven Design - a match in heaven!
