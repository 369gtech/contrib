description: "Speaker: Gerard Meszaros (@gerardmes), CTO @ FeedXL Horse Nutrition\n\nAutomated unit testing is commonly considered an essential part of writing reliable, bug-free software. But writing automated tests introduces a number of challenges of its own. Naively-written tests are complex, brittle and hard to understand. This increases their cost-of-ownership and reduces the value they provide.\n\nIn this talk, Gerard Meszaros examines some of the key pitfalls and shows us how to improve the quality of our automated tests. He shows us how we can make our tests shorter, clearer and cheaper to prepare by refactoring a long, complex test into a short easy-to-understand test. Then he goes on to show how we can apply the same concepts to writing new tests quickly and cheaply.\n\nAbout the speaker\n\nGerard Meszaros is an independent software development consultant and trainer with 30+ years experience in software and over a decade of experience in agile methods. He started doing eXtreme Programming in 2000 and quickly discovered that close attention to test code craftsmanship was essential to keep the cost of change low. He described his key learnings in his book xUnit Test Patterns â€“ Refactoring Test Code. Since then he has turned his attention to applying the same concepts to organizing the automated acceptance tests as executable examples. He has coached teams and taught courses as far afield as China, India, Japan and Europe. He is also the CTO and Product Owner of FeedXL.com which provides a web-based diet optimization tool for horses.\n\nSlides: http://singapore2016.xunitpatterns.com/\n\nEvent Page: http://2016.agilesingapore.org\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/XvBk/"
