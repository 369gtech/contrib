title: 'Dragan Jojic - The Language of Outcomes'
recordingDate: 1562659645
description: 'For the past 20 years, the Agile community has been trying to improve the world of work. However, while working in new ways, we continue to use the old language. For example, we talk about product/sprint backlogs and ceremonies, and “…doing twice the work in half the time”. It is hardly surprising then to hear the people we have been supporting on their change journey say that it’s all the same as before. We should change this perception by learning and using the language of outcomes to consistently remind ourselves, as individuals, teams and organisations, why we are here, what our purpose is and what we are trying to achieve. From our purpose, to outcomes, fresh insights, and back again - we will introduce to you “Wholehearted Delivery”. The model consists of three complementary perspectives: creation of value, enhancing fitness and alignment with purpose. We look forward to your input to help us evolve our model and make it more useful.'
