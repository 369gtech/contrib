title: 'Shapeless Meets Implicit Macros'
recordingDate: 1363983251
description: "'Shapeless,' allow me to introduce you to implicit macros.\n\nMiles Sabin, the 1000th (or seemingly) Precog engineer to speak at this year NE Scala Symposium, demonstrates his project called 'shapeless.' The project is designed to guide runtime behavior by making use of Scala's implicit resolution mechanisms, but as Miles points out errors can often occur.\n\nIn this talk, Miles shows how incorporating implicit macros can make 'shapeless' appear even more attractive.\n\n** More free Scala resources, everything from NE Scala '12 & '13, and professional training all available at http://bit.ly/nescala13"
