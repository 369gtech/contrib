description: "Domain-Driven Design Europe 2020\nhttp://dddeurope.com - https://twitter.com/ddd_eu\n\nServerless architectures are becoming mainstream, significantly reducing time to market and operational costs; but to get the most out of this opportunity, applications have to be designed around the constraints of this deployment architecture. This session is a mix of an experience report and looking at future trends, explaining how domain modelling, distilling the core and serverless architectures overlap.\n\nAuthor of Humans vs Computers, Impact Mapping, Specification by Example and a few more booksâ€¦ Working on MindMup and Claudia.js."
