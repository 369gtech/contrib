title: 'Beyond Getting Started: Using OpenTelemetry to Its Full Potential - Sergey Kanzhelev & Morgan McLean'
language: English
recordingDate: 1574400517
description: "Speakers: Morgan McLean, Sergey Kanzhelev\nOpenTelemetry is a cloud-native set of APIs and libraries used to generate, collect, and export telemetry from distributed systems. This session goes beyond a basic introduction, and demonstrates how you can customize OpenTelemetryâ€™s components and architecture for the unique needs of your app. Attendees will learn how to set up and configure built-in data collectors, how to write their own instrumentation, how to extend and enrich automatically collected telemetry with app-specific information, and how to send this data to Prometheus and Jaeger for analysis."
