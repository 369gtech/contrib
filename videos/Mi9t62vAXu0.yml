description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nHey, Did You Hear About This New CVE? - A Vulnerability Response Playbook - Andrew Lytvynov, Independent & Alexandr Tcherniakhovski, Google\n\nKubernetes provides a lot of great ways to harden the security of your infrastructure. But despite how much you have it locked down, things will inevitably go wrong. Hope is not a strategy, so you need a contingency plan. In this prescriptive talk, you will learn how to prepare for complex vulnerabilities (like the Intel speculative execution or Go HTTP/2 DoS vulnerabilities), mitigate them and clean up afterwards. We’ll share our experiences with the GKE fleet, dealing with newly announced vulnerabilities, and lessons learned balancing both security and reliability of workloads. You will learn how to develop a response playbook for vulnerabilities. You will also learn about the tools that Kubernetes provides to help make your vulnerability response less hectic, such as audit logs, network policies and RBAC.  This talk will not cover live attacks (attackers in your infrastructure).\n\nhttps://sched.co/ZerA"
