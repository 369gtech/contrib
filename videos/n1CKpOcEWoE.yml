description: "by Dan Jenkins\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/H.1309/webxr.webm\n\n\nThe way our users consume media and interact with applications is changing. That's partially down to hardware costs coming down but its also because its easier than ever to build these new forms of communication without it costing to earth. WebXR is a standard that combines both Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality into a Web API; by using all that the web has to offer we can build amazing experiences for our users that just require a phone, a web browser and maybe a cheap VR headset. Come check out how you can utilise the technologies deep within the browser on your mobile device to build amazing immersive experiences. \n\nRoom: H.1309 (Van Rijn)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 11:30:00+01"
