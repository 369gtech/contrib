description: 'This talk is about my personal journey shipping my side project, LearnInPublic.org, from April to July this year. It involves both technical and nontechnical takeaways, from coding and designing the landing page and ecommerce fulfilment, to writing and marketing the book, all as a solo dev. Shipping side projects for money is a dream for many dev and I wanted to share what I learned doing mine.'
