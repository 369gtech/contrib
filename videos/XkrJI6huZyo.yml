title: '#FOSSBack: Najeeb Khan - Creating Belonging in Remote Teams'
recordingDate: 1614694146
description: "Remote teams are more disconnected and fragmented now more than ever. 54% of employees are unattached from their work & company. They put in the time, but not energy or passion, often doing the minimum required.\n\n75% of managers struggle to maintain the culture remotely and it leads to 18% drop in productivity for the team. It impacts mental health, well-being, and churn of employees.\n\n\nBy creating belonging through social interaction at work, it not only improves the well-being of the employees but also increases productivity.\n\n\n###########\n\nFollow us on Social Media and join the Community!\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Fossbckstg\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/groups/8653059/​\n\nFOSS Backstage is an event by Plain Schwarz – https://plainschwarz.com"
