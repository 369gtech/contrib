description: "Open Service Brokers for the CF Container Runtime - Jonathan Berkhahn & Morgan Bauer, IBM\n\nThe Open Service Broker API is an open standard based on the Cloud Foundry service broker model. The Cloud Foundry Container Runtime is backed by Kubernetes, a container orchestrator. The Kubernetes Service Catalog project is an implementation of the platform side of the OSBAPI running as part of Kubernetes. Come learn how to utilize the same brokers and services you use for applications running on CF for containers hosted by the new container runtime. We'll briefly cover the service broker architecture before demoing the set-up and operation of the Service Catalog on top of the CF Container Runtime and going over best practices for writing brokers to ensure that they are multi-platform compatible. \n\nAbout Morgan Bauer\nMorgan Bauer works on Open Source at IBM in San Jose as part of the Cloud Division. Morgan is a maintainer on the core Docker Engine and also a founding contributor of the Kubernetes Service-Catalog.\n\nAbout Jonathan Berkhahn\nJonathan is a current contributor to the Open Service Broker API and the Kubernetes Service Catalog project, working with contributors from many companies Previously, he was a core Cloud Foundry contributor for several years, working on components ranging from the controller, the backend runtime, routing tier, and frontend.
