description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTOpia Chicago 2021. #GOTOcon #GOTOpia\nhttp://gotochgo.com\n\nFelienne Hermans - Author of “The Programmer’s Brain” and Associate Professor at the Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science\n\nABSTRACT\nResearch shows that on average developers spend about 58 percent of their time on reading code! However, we are not explicitly taught reading code in school or in boot camps, and we rarely practice code reading too.\nMaybe you have never thought about it, but reading code can be confusing in many ways. Code in which you do not understand the variable names causes a different type of confusion from code that is very coupled to other code. In this talk, Felienne Hermans, associate professor at Leiden University, will firstly dive into the cognitive processes that play a role when reading code. She will then show you theories for reading code, and close the talk with some hands-on techniques that can be used to read to any piece of code with more ease and fewer headaches [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n00:39 How I got started\n03:32 Coding for kids\n04:42 The best part of programming is finding mistakes\n05:16 Programmers only learn from making mistakes\n05:50 You will fail often & it will be frustrating\n06:44 Never be afraid to mess around & experiment\n07:06 Break the rules\n07:53 And most importantly: it's fun\n09:11 When & how do you learn to code?\n11:55 How do people learn?\n12:40 We don't teach reading code\n15:10 We don't practice reading code\n17:02 We don't have theories for reading code\n21:44 Different forms of confusion\n27:40 More techniques from reading\n29:42 Want to know more?\n31:13 Summary\n32:25 Outro\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotochgo.com/2021/sessions/1754/how-to-read-complex-code\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nFelienne Hermans • The Programmer's Brain • https://amzn.to/3mENbN0\nFabio Pereira • Digital Nudge • https://amzn.to/3yhxJu9\nDaniel Kahneman • Thinking, Fast and Slow • https://amzn.to/2XmJEtf\nThaler & Sunstein • Nudge • https://amzn.to/3CglrmX\nDan Ariely • Predictably Irrational • https://amzn.to/3lyDBd7\nRobert B Cialdini • Influence, New and Expanded • https://amzn.to/3tL8GxB\nLinda Rising • Design Patterns in Communications Software • https://amzn.to/2XsxDCg\nLinda Rising • The Pattern Almanac 2000 • https://amzn.to/3kfgIfi\nLinda Rising • The Patterns Handbook • https://amzn.to/3lxDPAS\nLinda Rising • Fearless Change • https://amzn.to/3AfvyrK\nLinda Rising • More Fearless Change • https://amzn.to/2Z3bYBh\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#Programming #Coding #ComplexCode #ReadCode #TeachingKidsToCode #KidsCodingClasses #ProgrammingKids #ProgrammersBrain #FelienneHermans\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
