IoT devices, in particular, are dependent on connectivity as functionality moved to the cloud. How do devices recover unattended? How do you reduce cost via multiple network technologies?\n\nThe Nerves project has a new open-source network configuration library for IoT devices called VintageNet. This talk introduces the project and describes how companies are using it for reliable connectivity via multi-homing, LTE-fallback, and mesh networking.\n\nSlides & full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/frank-hunleth/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - FRANK HUNLETH\nNerves co-author\n\nFrank has built embedded Linux-based software for products in many industries including medical, consumer, telecommunications and defense. He is a co-author of the Nerves project and maintains several projects used in embedded Elixir-based devices such as the Elixir Circuits set of libraries, toolshed, fwup, and erlinit.\n\nMore on Frank Hunleth: https://codesync.global/speaker/frank-hunleth/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM SF 2020\nCode BEAM SF is powered by Code Sync.
