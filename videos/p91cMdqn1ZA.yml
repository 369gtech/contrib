description: "KeeHuat Yeo\nOracle\n\nThe intent of DevSecOps is to build on the approach that security is everyoneâ€™s responsibility with the objective of having corporate security decisions incorporated quickly and seamlessly with DevOps without compromising on security. Traditional security is seen to be a major roadblock for DevOps and therefore is deprioritized or bypassed all together. Traditionally, security is only applied after a system has been designed and not during the design phase. Unfortunately such approach introduces inherent risk as security is only an afterthought. With DevSecOps, security can be embraced at every level of DevOps. This session covers the role of Identity as a Service (IDaaS) in DevSecOps to close gaps in existing security measures."
