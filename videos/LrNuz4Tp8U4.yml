description: "Containerization has completely revolutionized the way we develop and deploy, rapidly becoming the tool of choice when we need platform control, but don't want the responsibility of running infrastructure. Taking these technologies and transforming them into production ready systems is the next big step! Introducing Kubernetes, the open-source system for automatically deploying, scaling, and managing containerized systems.\n\nThis session will run through the basics of Kubernetes, setting up your first cluster, deploying your first workload, and taking it to the extreme with automated build and release tooling using AKS and Azure DevOps.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks, courses, and conferences in the following links:\nhttps://ndcsydney.com/\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
