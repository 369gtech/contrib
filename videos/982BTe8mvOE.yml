title: 'Juan De Dios Santos Rivera: Two clicks to cluster and block thousands of spammers'
recordingDate: 1625646971
description: "LOVOO's (a social and dating platform) moderation team focuses on keeping the platform free of unwanted users. Our newest solution involves using unsupervised learning to cluster and visualize users' batches within a few clicks to moderate them according to the clustering algorithm's outcome.\n\nBehind those clicks, there's a large collection of components supporting the system. These include a machine learning service that creates the model, our whole Antispam platform, Kafka, gRPC, databases, lots of data, and more.\n\nThis talk is about the complete platform— its intention, motivation, architecture, and results.\n\nSpeaker: Juan De Dios Santos Rivera – https://2021.berlinbuzzwords.de/member/juan-de-dios-santos-rivera\n\nMore: https://2021.berlinbuzzwords.de/session/two-clicks-cluster-and-block-thousands-spammers"
