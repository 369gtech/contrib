description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2012\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nKim Dalsgaard - Independent Consultant\n\nABSTRACT\nIn order to enable users to continue interacting with mobile web applications even when their network connection is unavailable the HTML5 specification contains a collection of API's that helps an app function offline. These API's addresses both the problem of storing the actuale application, and the problem of storing the data the application is working on.\n\nIn this talk Kim Dalsgaard will walk through the AppCache, Web Storage, Web SQL, and IndexedDB specifications, and show how these in combination can make a mobile web application function offline.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
