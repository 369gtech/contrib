description: "A Google TechTalk, 2019/10/10, presented by Rachel Fenichel.\nABSTRACT: Blockly's block rendering pipeline has been completely rewritten! Instead of a single method for all of rendering there is now a series of discrete methods which measure, position, and draw a block and all its components. Rachel dives into rendering details with examples of what's possible with the new renderer and how you can customize Blockly.  Slides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nNk0DYT_aeMxKS7BVfAZxpQSOmwBu9XuG96oezrp_Ss/edit?usp=sharing\n\nMore about the Summit: https://sites.google.com/corp/view/blockly-user-summit-2019/agenda\n\nAbout the speaker: Rachel is a software engineer at Google and an expert in all things Blockly. She has spent the last four years working on Blockly, and she can tell you more than you want to know about cross-platform mouse/pointer event handling.\n\nRachel likes to bake bread, ride her bike, and curl up with a good book."
