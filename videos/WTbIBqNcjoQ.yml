Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nKubernetes at Reddit: Tales from Production - Greg Taylor, Reddit, Inc  \n\nThis talk is the EAGERLY-anticipated sequel to last year's \"Kubernetes at Reddit: An Origin story\". Whereas the saga's first installment focused on early results, thoughts, and a rough higher-level vision, this year's edition serves as a retrospective for how it all shook out over Reddit's last year of rapid Kubernetes adoption.    The audience will hear of successes, share in the heartbreak of production explosions, and gain insight into what has and hasn't worked well for one of the world's busiest web properties. Topics covered include:    * A brief recap of InfraRed, our internal Infrastructure product  * How org-wide adoption has progressed  * Scaling challenges (Infrastructure and Inter/Intra-team)  * Fires, near-misses, and outages, oh my!  * Successes and celebration  * Lingering questions and challenges  * The impact of Kubernetes at Reddit \n\nhttps://sched.co/UaaR"
