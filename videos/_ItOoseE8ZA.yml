description: "In this talk, we will look at how using reactive programming effectively requires us to think a little bit differently about our code and how the different pieces fit together. We will walk through real code examples and compare and contrast imperative and reactive approaches to the same problem. We will use the example of Angular to show how reactive programming is becoming increasingly important in both the framework's design and application.\n\nEVENT:\n\nAngular Camp 2017\n\nSPEAKERS:\n\nTodd Motto & James Henry\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nThe original video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNnGb5WmfGk"
