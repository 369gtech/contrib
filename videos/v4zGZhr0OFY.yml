description: "Active-Active Redis Databases Across Geo-Distributed Cloud Foundry Foundations - Adi Foulger & Cassie Zimmerman, Redis Labs\n\nWhen looking at business-critical workloads, where downtime represents either massive business impact or a potentially mission-ending event, then high-availability of data services becomes a key business differentiator. High availability is not only about the ability to recover gracefully from an incident, but also the ability to maintain lower local latencies to application users and achieving strong eventual consistency for your geo-distributed data-service. A highly-available, well-integrated and secure data service that can cover a variety of use cases for different applications, is a key benefit to platform and or business owners.\n\nThe Redis Enterprise Bosh release for Cloud Foundry platform gives developers a turn-key solution to set up a globally distributed Redis clusters that will handle replication and consistency automatically, using advanced Conflict-Free Resolution Data Type technology (CRDBs).\n\nIn this talk, we will cover:\n\nUse cases that require an Active-Active database\n\nSet-up of geo-distributed Redis clusters across Cloud Foundry foundations\nBenefits to global application development and operation teams\n\nhttps://cfseu18.sched.com/event/GATa/active-active-redis-databases-across-geo-distributed-cloud-foundry-foundations-adi-foulger-cassie-zimmerman-redis-labs"
