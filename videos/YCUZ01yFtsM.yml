description: "Speaker(s):\nJulia Wilkowski, Peter Norvig\n\nDescription:\nIn the past, a student's college career was summed up with a transcript consisting of about 120 bits of information over 4 years. Today, information can be collected at a much faster rate, every minute the student is online. This session will describe how that information can be used to help students and educators improve the process, and how Google has experimented with online courses, to: (1) learn what material works and what can be improved; (2) evaluate a student's progress; and (3) inform the next generation of online courses.\n\nWatch all Google I/O 2014 videos at: g.co/io14videos"
