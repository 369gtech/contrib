description: "We're going to learn how to use deep learning to convert an image into the style of an artist that we choose. We'll go over the history of computer generated art, then dive into the details of how this process works and why deep learning does it so well.\n\nCoding challenge for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/How-to-Generate-Art-Demo\n\nItai's winning code:\nhttps://github.com/etai83/lstm_stock_prediction\n\nAndreas' runner up code:\nhttps://github.com/AndysDeepAbstractions/How-to-Predict-Stock-Prices-Easily-Demo/blob/master/stockdemo.ipynb\n\nMore learning resources:\nhttps://harishnarayanan.org/writing/artistic-style-transfer/\nhttps://ml4a.github.io/ml4a/style_transfer/\nhttp://genekogan.com/works/style-transfer/\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576\nhttps://jvns.ca/blog/2017/02/12/neural-style/\n\nStyle transfer apps:\nhttp://www.pikazoapp.com/\nhttp://deepart.io/\nhttps://artisto.my.com/\nhttps://prisma-ai.com/\n\nPlease subscribe!
