So, how about we use it to process just a few background jobs? In this talk, learn about how introducing RabbitMQ for background jobs led us to an explosion of microservices and the creation of a messaging framework that changed and grew alongside our business. \n\nWe'll share lessons learned from managing and scaling RabbitMQ as a background job orchestrator, tell you how RabbitMQ empowered us to move away from a legacy monolith and towards an event-driven, distributed system, and sell you on RabbitMQ (along with another citizen of the BEAM, Elixir) as the backbone for a robust, performant, scalable and maintainable event-driven system.\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKERS:\n\nSophie DeBenedetto\nSophie is an engineer at GitHub and co-author of Programming Phoenix LiveView. She is a graduate of, and former teacher at, The Flatiron School and has a passion for coding education. That passion, plus her love of Elixir, has also led her to become a maintainer of Elixir School, a free, open-source Elixir curriculum. She also participates in an Elixir mentoring program and is always seeking opportunities to help others learn and grow. Historically she is a cat person but will admit to owning a dog.\n\nSteven Nunez\nSteven is an experience Elixir dev who championed Elixir adoption at his previous engineering organization, The Flatiron School. He's a dedicated teacher with years of experience teaching programming to career-change students and more recently he co-created a workshop on event-driven design with Elixir and RabbitMQ.\n---\n\nRabbitMQ Summit\nWebsite: https://rabbitmqsummit.com\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/RabbitMQSummit"
