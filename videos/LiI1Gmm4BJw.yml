description: "ITS, intelligent transport systems, is about making transport more efficient, secure and environment friendly. Data from sensors along the roads, combined with data from cars and the world around it, makes it possible for you to build new and exciting services. There are a lot of datasets with such data freely available for you to use.\nThe Norwegian Public Road Administration - NPRA (Statens vegvesen) is one of the largest providers of open location based ITS data. We will show you how you through APIs can get access to data about live traffic reports, travel time, road toll, speed limits, web cameras and much more.\n\nNorwegian Public Roads Administration has recently launched a new web based map solution. We will also take a look at this solution, the experiences and challenges developing it, and what data sets that are used in it."
