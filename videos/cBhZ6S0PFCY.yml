description: "Speaker(s):\nIlya Grigorik, Pierre Far\n\nDescription:\nData delivered over an unencrypted channel is insecure, untrustworthy, and trivially intercepted. We must protect the security, privacy, and integrity of our users data. In this session we will take a hands-on tour of how to make your websites secure by default: the required technology, configuration and performance best practices, how to migrate your sites to HTTPS and make them user and search friendly, and more. Your users will thank you.\n\nWatch all Google I/O 2014 videos at: g.co/io14videos"
