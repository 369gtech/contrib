title: 'Ousterhout''s Dichotomy Isn''t (Part 2 of the Simplicity/Power/Focus Series) - Stuart Halloway'
recordingDate: 1357585589
description: 'Ousterhout''s Dichotomy attempts to split the language world into system and scripting languages. This split isn''t simple, and doesn''t work. But understanding where it fails is a great way to approach the concept of power in programming languages. In this talk we will cover - what it means to be powerful - how Clojure''s design gives you power - the relation between power and stratification - why the numerics changed in 1.3 - a post-Ousterhout classification scheme that is more useful - some predictions for Clojure''s future.'
