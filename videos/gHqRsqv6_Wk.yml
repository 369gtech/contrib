description: 'In this panel, we will get unique insights into the minds of tech leads, how do they set an example for hundreds of developers, and make choices that shape the whole organization. Many questions will be there: How do you manage and empower your team? How do you evaluate whether you are doing a good job? Should a tech lead still write code? Curious about how do they do it? Join tech leads from Picnic, DAZN, and unu to join a panel discussion and share their experiences. Of course, they will answer your questions too... so, just come by!'
