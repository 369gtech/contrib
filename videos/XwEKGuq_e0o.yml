description: "Loading resources on the Web has always been a performance hurdle. Late discovery, contention and bloat caused it to be the common performance bottleneck. In recent years advances in protocols, browser behaviour and performance APIs improved resource loading significantly, but thereâ€™s still room to make it even faster.\n\nIn this talk we will go over resource loading improvements browsers have made in recent years, discuss related best practices and describe various innovations that are being worked on to improve resource loading even further.\n\nSlides: https://yoavweiss.github.io/perfnow_resource_loading/\nAbout Yoav: https://twitter.com/yoavweiss\n\nMore about performance.now(); https://perfnow.nl or https://twitter.com/perfnowconf\nReceive conference announcements in your inbox: https://perfnow.nl/subscribe"
