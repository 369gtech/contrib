title: 'Check your privilege: Myisha Hill in conversation'
language: English
recordingDate: 1604504320
description: "In a society that promotes perfectionism, antiracism work is made tougher for those of us who want to do better but worry that we might make a mistake.\n\nThis is the byproduct of patriarchal, white supremacist cultures that value the work of the individual above all else. In contrast, Check Your Privilege values the collective, knowing that this vulnerable work requires us to lean into interdependence and imperfection.\n\nCheck Your Privilege requires all of us to pause, make time for self-reflection, and connection through relationships in order to move forward."
