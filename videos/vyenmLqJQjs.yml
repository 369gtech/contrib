language: English
recordingDate: 1479323954
description: "The Linux kernel is the largest collaborative software development project ever. This talk will discuss exactly how Linux is developed, how fast it is happening, and how we all try to stay sane keeping up with it (hint, git is the reason).\n\nGreg Kroah-Hartman is a Fellow at the Linux Foundation. He is currently responsible for the stable Linux kernel releases, and is a maintainer of the USB, TTY, and driver core subsystems in the kernel as well as other portions of the codebase that he wishes he could forget about. He is the author of two books about Linux kernel development, both free online, and has written many papers and articles about the Linux kernel."
