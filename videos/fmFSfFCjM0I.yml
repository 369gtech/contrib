description: "Memory leaks are not rare in applications of all sizes. When left unnoticed and uncared for, they can easily bring your application down at the exact moment when the majority of your clients are onsite, with disastrous consequences for your business. This presentation explains what a memory leak is and how it can happen in languages with garbage collection. Then it addresses how to verify that your application is leak-free before going to production and make sure that it will remain in that condition.\n\n\nAuthor:\nNikita Salnikov-Tarnovski\nCo-founder of Plumbr, the memory leak detection product, where he now contributes as core developer.
