title: 'Webinar: Multi Cluster Service Mesh Operations and Extensibility with WebAssembly'

recordingDate: 1592338780
description: "Designing, building and operating applications for cloud-native infrastructure that are resilient, scalable, secure, and meet compliance and IT objectives gets complicated. A reality for the organizations with which we work is the fact they need to run across a hybrid deployment footprint, not just Kubernetes. Service mesh helps solve these challenges but still require customization at the organization or per cluster level.\n\nAs a highly extensible data plane for service mesh, Envoy Proxy is the cloud-native application networking technology. In this webinar, we will explore different service mesh deployment patterns, multi-cluster topologies and operations, and extensibility with WebAssembly for scalable, highly available, and resilient application environments.\n\nJoin us for a practical session that covers:\n* Multi-cluster design patterns with Kubernetes and Service Mesh\n* Service discovery, identity federation and more in a multi-cluster world\n* How WebAssembly simplifies Envoy based service mesh customization\n* Live demos and Q&A\n\nSpeakers:\nIdit Levine, Founder and CEO\_@Solo.io \nChristian Posta, Global Field CTO\_@Solo.io"
