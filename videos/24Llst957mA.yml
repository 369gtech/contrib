description: 'Only lazy Java developers didn’t hear about new Java 8 and its powerful feature ‘stream API’. The most active developers already tried to play with streams. This talk is neither for lazy nor active developers. This talk is for curious. We’ll look under the hood of ‘Stream API’, we’ll try to understand how it works, we’ll learn how to implement our custom streams, and how to use streams efficiently.'
