title: 'MATT OVERALL: Keeping Change Human'
recordingDate: 1634643208
description: 'It is easy to think of change as a process to be run, or a checklist of steps to walk through, but it is important to remember than invariably there is a human somewhere in there. Remembering to think carefully about either your own teams or customers (ideally both), can be the difference between glowing success and crushing failure - regardless of how good the technical solutions are. This talk is hopefully a reminder to look beyond the code and processes and to remember to consider how tech team actions can affect our users in emotional ways. Understanding and thinking about this can allow us to build better solutions that are embraced more readily and ultimately lead to better outcomes for all those involved.'
