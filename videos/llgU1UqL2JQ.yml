description: "Guido Schmutz\nEngineer -IT\nTrivadis AG\n\nShould we use traditional REST APIs to bind services together? Or is it better to use a more loosely-coupled protocol? This talk will dive into how we piece services together in event driven systems, how we use a distributed log (event hub) to create a central, persistent history of events and what benefits we achieve from doing so. Apache Kafka is a perfect match for building an asynchronous, loosely-coupled event-driven backbone. Events trigger processing logic, which can be implemented in a traditional as well as in a stream processing fashion. The talk will show the difference between a request-driven and event-driven communication and show when to use which."
