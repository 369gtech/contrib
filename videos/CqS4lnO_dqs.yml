description: "In this episode of Dartisans, Dimitri Glazkov (one of the godfathers of Web Components) gives a presentation on Dart's Web UI library. Also, John Messerly and Siggi Cherem (who helped build the Web UI library) give a presentation on using Web UI, web components, and data-driven templates with Dart. A lot of things have changed since our last episode focused on Web Components, and this was an awesome edition of Dartisans!\n\nLearn more about Dart at http://www.dartlang.org."
