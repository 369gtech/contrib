description: "Discrete Math is a subject everyone interested in Computer Science needs to understand. It consists of math branches like graph theory, set theory, number theory, & combinatorics. It helps create databases, algorithms, & security structures. In this video, I'll explain the most relevant topics in Discrete Math one by one as we try to decrypt the password for a SQL database. Along the way, we'll use discrete math in various ways. I wanted to see if I could summarize an important course I took in college in a single video.
