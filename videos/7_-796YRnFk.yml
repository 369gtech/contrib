title: 'Keynote: Coding Culture - Sven Peters - Codemotion Milan 2016'
recordingDate: 1480592075
description: 'A great coding culture gives the power back to the developer and concentrates on making them productive and happy by removing unnecessary overhead, bringing autonomous teams together, helping the individual programmer to innovate, and raising the awareness among developers to create better code. I will talk about how to establish and foster a strong engineering-focused culture and give lots of examples from our experience at Atlassian to show that once you''re working in a great coding culture, you won''t want to work anywhere else.'
