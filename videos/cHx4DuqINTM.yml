title: '[Uber Open Summit 2018] Building Your Own Metrics Pipeline with M3'
language: English
recordingDate: 1542695935
description: "To facilitate the growth of Uber’s global operations, we need to be able to quickly store and access billions of metrics on our back-end systems. As part of our robust and scalable metrics infrastructure, we built M3, an open source metrics platform that has been in use at Uber for several years now. During this talk, engineer Nikunj Aggarwal walks through what a general metrics pipeline looks like and how M3 components can be used for the various stages of the pipeline without locking you in to a particular vendor. He also covers some of the unique challenges we face at Uber’s scale and how the learnings from those can be used by other companies.\n\nLearn more about Uber Open Source: https://uber.github.io/"
