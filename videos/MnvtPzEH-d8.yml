description: "Enterprise Development is increasingly turning toward streaming compute to meet the demands of scalability, availability, and real-time processing.\n\nWe developed OPERATR, a tool that helps development teams navigate the complexities of building streaming compute with Apache Kafka. It is built entirely in Clojure and Clojurescript, and in true Clojure style is more like a library than a platform.\n\nI’ll talk about why I think Clojure is a superb fit for product development, and we’ll discover the advantages of Clojure as we live-code data from Kafka through the JVM, and into the browser.\n\nAfter this talk I hope you’ll agree that streaming compute is the future, and Clojure is its heart."
