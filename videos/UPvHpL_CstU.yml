It allows to drive programmatically web browsers, such as Chrome, Firefox, etc. This talk presents Selenium-Jupiter (https://github.com/bonigarcia/selenium-jupiter), an open source JUnit 5 extension aimed to provide seamless integration with Selenium and Appium. JUnit is the most popular test frameworks for the Java and one of the most influential in software engineering. JUnit 5 is the next generation of JUnit, providing a brand-new programming and extension model called Jupiter. Selenium-Jupiter is a JUnit 5 extension to use Selenium and provides a rich variety of features, including the capability to use of local or remote browsers. Moreover, it allows to use browsers and Android devices in Docker containers out of the box. Selenium-Jupiter can be used to carry out different types of test of web applications, including functional, compatibility (i.e. using different browsers types and versions) or performance (i.e. using a big number of browsers) tests."
