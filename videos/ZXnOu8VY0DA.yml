language: English
recordingDate: 1563562531
description: "Aishwarya Sankaravadivel and Vikram Ramakrishnan, PayPal\n\nSearch is ubiquitous! From booking a cab in a ride sharing platform to searching for a job on LinkedIn, Elasticsearch has emerged as a prominent solution for search and has been increasingly adopted for Log analytics and Application Performance monitoring.\n\nIn this talk, we would focus on how SRE Partners can leverage Elasticsearch to turn data into actionable insights by helping them to find a needle in a haystack. While Elasticsearch's out of the box defaults works for smaller implementations, the nuances of handling a massive elastic deployment which can scale to serve billions of ingests and millions of searches per day requires a deeper knowledge on Elasticsearch internals.\n\nAt PayPal, we have been proficient in managing elastic at this scale and we will share our learnings from our past crunching experiences with specific interesting details around how things can go wrong and effective ways to mitigate them along with demos.\n\nIn a gist we will have the following sections:\n\nElasticsearch overview\nYou are not alone! (We will discuss about the common issues that we could face with elastic)\nMaking elastic truly elastic...(We will cover the following sections w.r.t to ingests, searches and monitoring)\nHandling the dark queries\nPolicing the police\nDo more with less\nElasticsearch in Action! (Demo)\n\nView the full SREcon19 Asia/Pacific program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon19asia/program.\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
