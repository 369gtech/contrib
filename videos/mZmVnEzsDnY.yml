title: 'Traversing Graphs with Gremlin (Artem Chebotko, Solutions Architect at DataStax)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1504532408
description: "Graph databases are exploding in popularity as we discover that they are fast, flexible ways of modeling our world and discovering the relationships not explicit in our data models. However, they present us with radically different data modeling problems and the need for radically different query languages.\n\nIn this talk, we’ll explore Gremlin, the query language used by the Apache TinkerPop™ graph computing framework. We’ll cover basic traversals, traversals that branch, traversals that recurse, traversals that analyze, and traversals that mutate the graph itself. Buckle up for some live coding on a real-life graph database."
