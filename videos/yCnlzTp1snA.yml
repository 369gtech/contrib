description: "Google I/O 2009 - Growing a SaaS-based services business reselling Google Apps\r\n\r\nJeff Ragusa, Daniel Jefferies\r\n\r\nThe popularity of Google Apps as a suite of business tools is creating new revenue opportunities for IT service providers, systems integrators, and freelance consultants.  Traditional value-added resellers are looking for ways to adapt their business for the world of cloud computing and the new Google Apps Authorized Reseller program provides the perfect framework for moving a services business in this direction.  In this session we'll look at revenue opportunities for partners in this area ranging from assisting with SaaS product selection, to guidance on best practices, to custom application development, deployment & integration work, and managed services.  We'll look at how the reseller program can enable service providers to take advantage of these opportunities through marketing, sales and technical tools and resources.  We'll also hear from one of Google's early resellers, Newmind Group, on their experiences, challenges, and successes.\r\n\r\nFor presentation slides and all I/O sessions, please go to: code.google.com/events/io/sessions.html"
