However, all is not perfect: as codebases get larger and less familiar it becomes more difficult to make changes, with mistakes creating bugs that test out runtime resilience and make pagers ring in the middle of the night.\n\nIn this talk, Louis introduces Gleam, a new language that takes inspiration from strongly typed languages such as Haskell, Rust and Elm to help BEAM programmers tackle these problems. We'll take a look at what Gleam offers, how it's made, and how it complements and interoperates with other BEAM languages. Lastly, we'll take a peek at what's planned for Gleam and how people can get involved with the language and the community.\n\nSlides & full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/louis-pilfold/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - LOUIS PILFOLD\nAuthor of Gleam, Elixir contributor\n\nLouis is an enthusiastic, jack-of-all-trades software engineer who writes code in many languages, some of which don’t even exist yet! A firm believer in open source, he maintains and contributes to many open source projects in the Erlang ecosystem and beyond.\n\nProfessionally Louis is bringing the world’s largest building society to the cloud as part of the Nationwide Digital Accelerator Platform and is removing the pain from advertising usage management as the founder of Waive Hello.\n\nUnprofessionally Louis is collecting terrible dance music and wearing shoes with toes.\nProfessionally Louis is bringing the world’s largest building society to the cloud as part of the Nationwide Digital Accelerator Platform, and is removing the pain from advertising usage management as founder of Waive Hello.\n\nUnprofessionally Louis is collecting terrible dance music and wearing shoes with toes.\n\nMore on Louis Pilfold: https://codesync.global/speaker/louis-pilfold/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE MESH LDN 19\nCode Mesh LDN is powered by Code Sync.
