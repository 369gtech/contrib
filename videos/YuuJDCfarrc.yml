description: "The practical story telling how Devops changed the culture of quality in the Bank. Recently Devops became mainstream topic. But only few people have a deep understanding how to apply it to the process of software quality assurance. Some believe that the Devops kills manual testing.\n\nI will talk about changes it makes to the role of QA engineers themself. The discussion main point is NOT about tools or technologies. It’s NOT about the “silver bullet” for your problems with the quality of products.\n\nInstead, I will show you an integrated approach which we used for quality assurance. It allowed us to significantly reduce the cost of finding and fixing defects. This approach has also accelerated the development and delivery value to our customers and made the whole process more transparent and predictable."
