description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nDesign Up Front: Socializing Ideas with Enhancement Proposals - Kirsten Garrison & Adam Kaplan, Red Hat; Christie Wilson, Google\n\nSpeakers: Christie Wilson, Kirsten Garrison, Adam Kaplan\nKEPs, TEPs, SHIPs - why are contributors asked to fill these out? Many open source projects adopt enhancement proposal (EP) processes to guide new feature development. These documents can be lengthy, and contributors can be reluctant to write designs up front before their code is accepted. There is great value in writing these documents and sharing them with fellow developers. How can a project adopt an EP process without intimidating new contributors? Can these principles be used with proprietary code, or small projects?\n\nIn this panel discussion, maintainers from Kubernetes, Tekton, and Shipwright will discuss the ins and outs of their enhancement processes, and how up front design discussions have improved the quality of their code. The panel will explore the history behind their processes, how they work, and how they have evolved over time. Panelists will also share how they make their EP processes effective and engaging. After the discussion you may add EPs to your own projects!"
