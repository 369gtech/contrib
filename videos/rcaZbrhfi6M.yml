description: "Europeâ€™s Leading Laravel Conference\nBlind-bird Tickets 2020 Available\nhttps://laracon.eu/2020/tickets\n\nEvery modern web application has notifications of some kind. This could be an email that informs the user about a new product, a notice on a dashboard that says a friendship request was accepted, a message on Slack that tells you about a successful build and so on. Laravel has a built-in notification system that makes all these tasks as simple as it can get. Let me show you how it works, how it helped me to create my first Laravel package and what the community has to offer to make notifications even more powerful. This is a practical approach to this topic with lots of live coding. You will come away with a better understanding of Laravel's notification system and how you can use it for your own applications."
