description: "Google Tech Talks\nMarch,  7 2008\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThe world has evolved a long way from the Stone Age to the Iron age, and\nwe are now in the new age of engineered materials. Today's discussion\nwill focus in the realm of advanced ceramics, materials that aren't\ntypically found in nature and can withstand extreme conditions. These\nmaterials are being used to stop bullets, enable diesel engines to run\nmore efficiently, produce solar cells, and much more. We will focus on\nBoron Carbide, Silicon Nitride, Silicon Carbide and a few other\nmaterials, where you will learn about how they came to be, how they are\nmade, and where they are used.\n\nSpeaker: Peter Goldstein\nPeter has been fascinated with the world around him and always wanted to\ndevelop new materials since he was a child. He earned B.S and M.S.\ndegrees in Materials Science and Engineering from the University of\nFlorida, focusing on ceramic materials. He is currently employed at\nCeradyne, Inc. a high growth, cutting edge Advanced Technical Ceramics\ncompany as a Sales Engineer. He works on developing new applications\nwith his customers using the materials Ceradyne offers, and as a hobby\nenjoys making glass sculptures at his home glass-blowing studio which he\nbuilt. There he gets to make new creations beyond the constraints of the\nordinary world by shaping glass with jet-engine like flames. He is also\nnewly married to a wonderful woman, Jessica, and they live happily\ntogether in Huntington Beach, CA."
