recordingDate: 1528734218
description: "What makes a team successful? Innovative? Great?\n\nAs software developers, many of us spend a fair amount of time working alone behind our computers, but when we come together as a team we can build truly great products for people. So how do we build effective teams?\n\nIn this talk, we’ll explore the concept of “safe” teams and how they enable us to build software faster and with more innovation than other teams. We’ll see how these concepts apply not just to our day jobs but also to the larger Open Source and Software Engineering communities to which we belong."
