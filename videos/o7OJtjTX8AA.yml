description: "Is good enough good enough? \n\nFor years Wix engineers were building fine services, but as systems became more complex, it was taking too long to do it. The code was clean, but it took thousands of lines for each service. \n\nIt was inefficient, so @Wix.comâ€™s CEO & Co-Founder, Avishai Abrahami, decided to step in. He set up weekly, hands-on coding sessions with some of his best developers, to chart a new path. \n\nThe goal he set for Wix Engineering was that if a project took months before - it would now take days, and every program with 10,000 lines of code - would now be 100. \n\nListen to this unique story, its challenges and impact."
