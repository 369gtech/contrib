description: "Knative vs Cloud Foundry: Where are the Overlaps and What are the Differences? - Dr. Michael Maximilien, IBM & Dr. Nic Williams, Stark & Wayne\n\nOn a superficial level, when looking at Knative, the function / service platform on top of Kubernetes, you might believe that this is a new version of Cloud Foundry but written using Kubernetes as a backend.\n\nIndeed, using a Knative CLI like Knctl, you can deploy your application from source with `$knctl deploy my-app ...` which is pretty close to `$cf push my-app ...`. But are the similarities skin deep? Where do they differ? And where do they overlap?\n\nIn this talk, I will compare and contrast the latest experiences of Cloud Foundry and Knative in order to extract meaningful comparison of their features from a developer perspective. Additionally, I will measure and compare key metrics that affect the developer experience, e.g., time to deploy, time to scale, and other such metrics. Finally, I will also compare and contrast the two platforms on features, e.g., RBAC, plug-ability, scalability, and some performance metrics.\n\nThe overall goal is to better understand how these two platforms are going especially as CF is looking to work on top of Kubernetes and therefore have the same backend.\n\nAbout Michael Maximilien (aka Dr. Max)\nComputer scientist, engineer, programmer and also photographer.
