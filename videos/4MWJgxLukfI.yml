title: 'First steps in GC tuning (Nikita Salnikov Tarnovski, Estonia)'
recordingDate: 1442527532
description: "Correctly configured Garbage Collector is essential for application performance. Unfortunately, there are more than 200 JVM configuration parameters which influence GC in one way or another. Their very obscure names make your command line looks like a magic incantation.\n\nThe goal of this talk is to demystify Garbage Collector optimisations. I will explain the basics of Garbage Collector tuning, starting from data collection and analysis. I will show how to formulate optimisation hypotheses, choose right parameters for it and verify if they worked. You will not become a GC expert, but you will not be afraid of GC tuning anymore."
