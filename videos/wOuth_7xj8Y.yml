At least most of the time. ðŸ™‚ \n\nThe talk is based on lessons learned while building PSPDFKit for iOS since 2010, yet most parts will be applicable to any language and team.\n\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/wearedevelopers.org/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/wearedevs/\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/wearedevelopers.org/"
