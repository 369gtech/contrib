description: "Recording brought to you by American Express. https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs\nLona is a configurable, server-driven UI system at Airbnb that renders features on Android, iOS, and web. It enables teams to rapidly build and iterate on features across platforms, removing boilerplate code for developers and bypassing limitations of native release cycles.\n\nPowered by a Kotlin domain-specific language (DSL), Lona isn't your ordinary server-driven UI system. It utilizes powerful features of the language to make server-driven UI maintainable and scalable. Lona also has accompanying Kotlin tooling to manage versioning, production responses, and to validate clients.\n\nIn this talk, we'll discuss the use-cases that led server-driven UI to become a widely-used paradigm for product teams at Airbnb. We'll explain how the Lona platform and DSL work and the benefits of using Kotlin. Finally we'll end with a demo, showing how easy it is to build a feature end-to-end with Lona and Kotlin.\n\nResources:\nKotlinConf website: https://jb.gg/fyaze5\nKotlinConf on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlinconf\n\nKotlin website: https://jb.gg/pxrsn6\nKotlin blog: https://jb.gg/7uc7ow\nKotlin on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlin\n\n#KotlinConf19 #Kotlin #JetBrains\n\nAbout the Presenters:\nLaura Kelly is an Android engineer on the UX Platform team at Airbnb. She builds UI infrastructure and frameworks, as well as Airbnb’s Design Language System for Android. Prior to becoming an Android engineer, she was a frontend web engineer at Airbnb and at early stage startups. When not working on performant and beautiful Android user interfaces, Laura is a competitive powerlifter.\n\nI grew up in France, learned how to code by myself, created an Android app before owning a smartphone, owned and operated a cybercafé in Paris, managed an esports team, moved to San Francisco to work for an Android-first startup. I now build Android UI infrastructure for Airbnb."
