description: "Health Care Services Corporation (HCSC) is driving its Digital Transformation by developing APIs and applications using XP methodologies. Geode is a distributed in-memory data grid which provides data services to the APIs which require near real time access to large data sets. In this session, we will discuss our approach to support rapid development and continuous deployment of this high-performance data environment that backs the Digital APIs. We will outline our chosen architecture and general challenges, and share some specific solutions, including: \n- Orchestrating the provisioning and continuous configuration of a Geode cluster with Concourse and Ansible \n- Test Driven Development and Continuous Deployment for server-side data functions.\n\nSpeakers:\nRyan Hunt\nSenior Developer, Health Care Service Corp\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
