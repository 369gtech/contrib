description: "In an increasingly connected world, AI becomes the invisible fabric that ties together people’s life experiences. But what is AI, and how will people interact with it? What are the opportunities and risks for people living in a world of intelligent systems? What is intelligence and what is artificial? Let’s get ahead of the technology curve by having artists and designers apply creativity and design thinking to map out critical emotional, physical, and experiential territories to foster a humanistic evolution of intelligent systems.\n\nBrian Kane currently lives and works in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He received a BFA in painting from Rhode Island School of Design in 1987, where he also teaches. His sculpture, interactive, and video work has shown in many museum and gallery exhibitions, and his pioneering real time video sampling techniques was influential to a generation of media artists. He was a founding member of the video art group EBN, and a primary collaborator with Amorphic Robot Works. His latest work \"Healing Tool\" is a disappearing billboard."
