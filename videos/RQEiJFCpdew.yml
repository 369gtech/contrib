description: "Abstract: This session will demonstrate how to orchestrate streaming applications (built using Spring Cloud Stream) and batch processing applications (built using Spring Cloud Task) in Spring Cloud Data Flow. Spring Cloud Data Flow provides stream/batch DSL to develop streaming pipelines and batch applications and deploy them to multiple platforms. Spring Cloud Data Flow's DSL and Designer User Interface will be demonstrated to show how you can easily assemble data pipelines without writing any code for common use-cases.\n\nSpeaker: Ilayaperumal Gopinathan, Principal Software Engineer, Pivotal\n\nFilmed at Pivotal Summit 2019 Singapore"
