description: "Kenneth Cukier (The Economist) \"The Manifest Destiny of Big Data\"\n\nEveryone uses the term big data but no on can agree on what it means or even if it's novel. However the label is useful to describe the radically new ways that the world interacts with information—for which the public, policymakers and even data geeks, are unprepared. Where Strata conferences tend to have a technical bent, this keynote considers big data's mainstream economic, political and social consequences.\n\nThe implications are far-reaching. Big data will replace human judgement in many instances just as steam power replaced muscle in the industrial revolution. It will mean greater efficiency and new winners and losers—not just among companies, but countries too. Yet it presents new challenges: not only for privacy but for \"propensity\"— algorithms predicting our behavior before we've acted, be it to repay a loan or commit a crime. Ultimately, we need new institutions to shape how we introduce big data into society, since it will become the undergirding our world whether we like it or not.\n\nThe Economist\nKenneth Neil Cukier the data editor of the The Economist, and co-author of \"Big Data: A Revolution that Will Transform How We Work, Live and Think\" to appear in early 2013. Previously, he was the paper's Tokyo correspondent and before that, its technology correspondent in London. From 2002 to 2004 Mr. Cukier was a research fellow at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, where he worked on the Internet and international relations. Additionally, Mr. Cukier serves on the board of directors of International Bridges to Justice, a Geneva-based NGO promoting legal rights in developing countries."
