recordingDate: 1585170904
description: "Kubernetes is an incredibly powerful platform. Companies of all shapes and sizes are embracing this powerful technology in a number of ways. The widespread adoption of Kubernetes is evidence of the benefits available to those who successfully ramp up. However, there is an overwhelming amount of information out there. It can be challenging for technologists to navigate the stormy seas of information overload.\n\nBeginners especially often struggle to make sense of the different concepts, tools, vernacular, resources, books, and thousands of other resources. Join CircleCI and the Cloud Native Computing Foundation as we walk through how to alleviate some of that overhead.\n\nPresenter: Angel Rivera, Developer Advocate @CircleCI"
