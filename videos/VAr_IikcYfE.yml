O\nn the other hand, Persistence an instance of plain old Java object (POJO) class that represents a table. When a POJO instance is in session scope, it is said to \nbe persistent i.e. Hibernate detects any changes made to that object and synchronizes it with database when the session is closed. Thus, persistence can be deemed \nas one of the ultimate features of the Hibernate framework.\n\nVideo gives a brief insight of following topics:\n\n1.Hibernate Tools\n2.Hibernate Environment\n3.Hibernate Configurations\n4.Persistence life Cycle\n5.JPA \n6.JPA Architecture\n7.Annotations\n8.XML Configuration\n9.Persistence Class\n10.
