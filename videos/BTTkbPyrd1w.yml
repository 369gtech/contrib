description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2019 by Martin Devillers, Dashlane.\n\nMore info: http://androidmakers.fr/schedule/?sessionId=JJK-6338\n\nOne of the stated goals of Android Architecture Components is to make it easier for developers to manage the lifecycle of application components. However, when looking at the full picture of combining configuration changes and background memory constraints with static and dynamic state, the basic examples provided in the documentation begin to show their limitations. A more in-depth exploration is needed.\n\nWe'll look at how to combine bundles and view models to fully persist the state of the application during its lifecycle. Using coroutines for concurrency, we'll see how dynamic state restoration can be achieved.\n\nGoing over increasingly complex examples of state restoration constraints, we'll see how our implementation of state restoration grows and evolves.\n\nAlex Karp Production"
