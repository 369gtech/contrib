description: "Filmed at http://2016.dotcss.io on December 2nd in Paris. More talks on http://thedotpost.com\n\nWe use easing all the time in web animation, but we don't always know what makes them tick. From cubic-beziers, to the Penner easing equations, to springs, Val takes a look at the math that drives the resulting motion and what each is best used for."
