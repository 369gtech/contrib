description: "In this presentation to the San Francisco Android User Group, Sandeep Bhanot of Salesforce.com discusses how the Enterprise IT world is currently being shaped by two powerful evolutionary shifts -- Mobile and Cloud Computing. More and more enterprise apps are becoming mobile and at the same time, IT departments are adopting Cloud Computing en masse. So what lies at the intersection of these two powerful forces and how does an Android developer build an enterprise mobile app that takes advantage of the Cloud?\n\nCovering topics like security, offline access, and push notifications, Bhanot demonstrates how you can develop an Android app using a 2-tier architecture that hosts its data in a cloud platform, all the UI and app logic on the Android device, and uses APIs to communicate between the tiers.\n\n** For more Android videos, resources, and training opportunities, head to http://marakana.com/s/tags/android"
