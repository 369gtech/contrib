title: 'Reactive Applications with Apache Pulsar and Spring Boot'
language: English
recordingDate: 1632325409
description: "This talk introduces a new open source library that adapts the Apache Pulsar Java Client to Reactive Streams. This allows building non-blocking, reactive applications with Apache Pulsar and Spring Boot that can leverage the full extent of Spring Reactive and its built-in resilience features, such as reactive non-blocking backpressure, timeout handling, retries with backoffs/jitter, and rate-limiting.\n \n The talk will focus on explaining why a reactive programming model is useful for working with Apache Pulsar and how the new open source library adapts the Apache Pulsar Java Clientâ€™s asynchronous API to Reactive Streams with Project Reactor.\n \n This talk also demonstrates how non-blocking asynchronous backpressure handling, failure tolerance, and resilience can be achieved in processing Pulsar messages using the adapter library and Spring Reactive in a Spring Boot application.\n\nLari Hotari, Senior Software Engineer at DataStax, Inc\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/reactive-applications-with-apache-pulsar-and-spring-boot"
