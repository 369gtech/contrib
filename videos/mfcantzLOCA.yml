description: 'So you decided to follow the fashion and just went for the XXXX Javascript Framework for the front part of your application, or even more you made the big jump and decided to go with a full stack JavaScript application.So now, how are you going to debug this application? Do you still do this old « alert » debugging or are there some better ways to debug JavaScript ? During this tool in action, I will show you the modern state of Javascript debugging. Do you know that you can have some logs with formatting in the browser console or that you can choose between six types of breakpoints ? Do you know how to take advantage of the dynamic aspect of JavaScript to help you to debug your application ? Demonstrations will be done using Chrome dev tools, but most of the tips will be applicable with other browsers.'
