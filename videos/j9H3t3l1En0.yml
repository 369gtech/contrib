language: English
recordingDate: 1517331604
description: "The Internet of Things is not a single choice of technology, approach or philosophy. It brings together multiple platforms, products and protocols, where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. One of the challenges of IoT is to make it as easy as possible to allow developers to create things, for play or profit, serious or whimsical, professional or hobbyist. Node-RED is an open-source visual tool for wiring the Internet of Things. Built on top of node.js, it provides a light-weight, browser-based editor that makes it easy to integrate different streams of both physical and digital events. This session explores what Node-RED can do, showcases how it has been used to great success across a range of industries and looks to the future of the project.\n\nEVENT:\n\nNode Summit 2017\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nNick Oâ€™Leary\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nNode Summit Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nNode Summit: http://www.nodesummit.com/\n\nNode Summit 2018 registration: http://www.nodesummit.com/registration/"
