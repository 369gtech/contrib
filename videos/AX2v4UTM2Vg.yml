recordingDate: 1433254133
description: "In recent years, functional programming has gained ground over object-oriented programming, mainly due to the advancement in computing power. The JVM is no exception. You can find powerful contenders in Clojure and Scala, but Groovy is not that far back in the race. The Groovy programming language contains a wide array of APIs and features that facilitate a functional programming style, such as closure composition, memorization, trampolines, and iterator methods. This session explores all of these features that are sure to spice up your daily experience.\n\n\nAuthors:\nAndres Almiray\nAndres is a Java/Groovy developer and a Java Champion with more than 12 years of experience in software design and development.
