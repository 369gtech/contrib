description: "You know that smartphone in your pocket? The one with gigahertz of processing power, a surprisingly good camera, and the ability to instantly access the whole of human knowledge? Despite all of that high technology, if I want to call you, I still have to punch in a phone number—a technological relic that remains integral to our telecommunication infrastructure.\n\nURLs are the same thing. The web is URLs and URLs are the web. Unfortunately, for the past few years, many JavaScript developers have started treating the URL as an afterthought, or a nice-to-have. In this talk, I'll show why URL neglect happens at your own peril, and how making JavaScript apps that respect the URL can be, well, downright pleasant.\n\nSource: http://2013.jsconf.eu/speakers/tom-dale-stop-breaking-the-web.html\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
