We want people in those countries to have access to Cloud Native technologies. Our mission is: building the foundation to inspire talent. During the last few months, we have created a virtual space offering resources which help enthusiasts to understand and contribute to open source projects. The pandemic brought many challenges to local preexisting communities but this wasn't our case, we have to opportunity to establish the community in a region where cloud computing technologies are barely known. This talk will share lessons that we learned in our journey to establish a local technical community remotely."
