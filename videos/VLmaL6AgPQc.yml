description: "In this talk I will go through the benefits and setup of a system for sharing knowledge in a\ncompany or research group. I will talk about how to structure a process of using Jupyter notebooks\nto run experiments and then share results with all stakeholders, including non-technical as well technical\nmembers of the team.\n\nSpeaker Bio: Currently co-founder of Kyso, previously founded Rinodrive and sold it in 2019 to Integumen. Built quantum\ncomputers when I was a Marie Curie fellow at Cambridge & Toshiba. Before that I worked at Tyndall stochastically\nmodelling quantum systems.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.
