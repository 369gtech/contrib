description: "It’s easy to forget what it felt like when you were a beginner. This lively dog-based* talk is about the rewards and pitfalls involved in introducing pair programming, TDD and an agile development approach to experienced developers who are used to working in a different way. It includes several practical suggestions of how to help and convince less agile-experienced colleagues.\nBased on my experience as a consultant technical lead, the aim is to help you to move your team members to a state of childlike fearlessness where learning is fun; is embedded in everything you do; and applies to all team members regardless of experience. \n\n\n*It turns out that images of dogs can be used to illustrate an astonishing variety of concepts!\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
