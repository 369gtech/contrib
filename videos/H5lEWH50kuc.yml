description: "Myth of the Dying Mouse: Why There is No Such Thing as Convergence in Consumer Electronics \n\nMore info: http://www.web2expo.com/webexny2011/public/schedule/detail/21303\n\nIn recent years, we have witnessed an overwhelming interest in new interface technologies, from touch, motion sensing, gesture input and improvements in speech. Correspondingly, we've seen claims about the death of the traditional keyboard and mouse input, ushering a \"new era\" in computer interfaces. In this short talk, I hope to convince you why that is might be a foolish perspective to take and why our future is not one type of computing, but rather a constellation of increasingly diverse increasingly specialized computing devices."
