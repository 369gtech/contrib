title: 'Android Honeycomb Fragments: Creating Large-Screen UIs for Android Devices'
language: English
recordingDate: 1315938642
description: "When Android was used nearly exclusively for very small screens, the one-activity/one-screen UI worked very well. Users moved from screen to screen to access different parts of a program's interface, and the Activity class (Android's concept of a task) maintained a back stack enabling quick and intuitive traversal through the strictly tree-structured workflow. This changes completely, however, when the UI is spread over the surface of a larger tablet screen. Some parts of the screen will remain constant over longer durations than others. Some parts of the screen determine the contents of other parts. A card-stack metaphor simply won't cut it anymore. With Android 3.0 SDK (API 11), Honeycomb, Android's developers introduced Fragments, a new, complex and powerful tool to encourage great large-screen UIs with consistent feel and behavior. This talk will introduce Fragments, give a thorough example of their use, and describe some of the traps that lurk in their use.\n\nAbout Blake Meike:\nBlake Meike is an engineer with more than 30 years of experience, much of it with Java.
