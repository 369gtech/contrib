description: "This talk is about 16 things I learnt while working with Erlang and Elixir. Each one is presented as a short statement of the idea, side-by-side with a short example, and of course a discussion. Though much of it was inspired while working with Erlang and Elixir, some of these lessons are drawn from other functional programming communities, and beyond. The lessons are broadly applicable, extending not only to other functional languages but also to the more mainstream languages.\n\nThis webinar is part of our #OpenErlang campaign, celebrating 20 years of open source Erlang.\n\nWEBINAR LIVE DATE: Wednesday 17 October 2018 | 15:00 CEST / 14:00 BST / 09:00 EDT / 06:00 PDT \n\n ——————————————————————— \n\nSPEAKER CONTACT DETAILS \n\nJOSEPH YIASEMIDES -  Joseph built servers in Erlang and Elixir at Erlang Solutions (Kraków) on projects involving JSON/HTTP APIs, TURN/STUN, XMPP, and AMQP.
