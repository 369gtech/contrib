description: "Thijs Suijten, Lead Developer, Q42\n\nREACT NATIVE: BUY ONE, GET ONE FREE?!\n\nNobody likes writing the same code twice; it’s tedious, error prone, and just not that fun. Sadly this still happens a lot when developing an app for iOS and Android. In this session you’ll learn how you can leverage the power of React Native to share code on both platforms.\n\nWe have done three large projects in React Native, with over 1 million downloads. All three projects use React Native differently, from integration into an existing app to a pure React Native setup. I’ll share the things we considered when choosing React Native, what architectures we used, and what impact React Native has on your team.\n\nAfter this talk, you will know if React Native is a good fit for your (future) project, how much fun it is to code in React Native (coming from Kotlin or Java) and what architecture you might want to use. You do not need to have React (Native) experience to follow this talk."
