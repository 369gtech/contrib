description: "Code Mesh London is the best place in Europe for non-mainstream tech and programming languages. On 4-5 December 2013 over 50 inventors and originators of the most innovative languages and technologies of the moment shared their experience with 200 attendees. Topics included Scala, Haskell, Clojure, Erlang, Elixir, Julia and much more. See you at Code Mesh 2014! codemesh.io/\n\nAbout the talk:\nA language integrated query allows developers to query data using the native language syntax. An implementation called LINQ was first introduced by Microsoft into its .NET framework and later adapted to other languages, like Slick in Scala, and now Ecto in Elixir.\nIn its current iteration, Ecto allows developers to query relational databases using Elixir features to guarantee your queries are fast, secure and type safe.\nThis talk will give a quick introduction to Ecto and its main components while discussing the design decisions behind the library. Discussing Ecto is a great opportunity to see the use of many Elixir features in practice like macros, providing the foundation for the Ecto syntax, and protocols, which guarantees our queries expressions are extensible and composable.\nTalk objectives:\n\n- Introduce developers to the Ecto library and to more advanced Elixir features\nTarget audience:\n\n- Developers interested to learn more about the Elixir programming language"
