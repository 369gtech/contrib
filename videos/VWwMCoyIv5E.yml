description: 'How can we make a full regression of our platform before each of the releases, to be sure we have not damaged something unexpected when making our changes? Full regression of any web platform is a process which requires tremendous effort and is error-prone. It can be automated in a classical way, covered with test cases and scenarios, but it is extremely hard to cover the application in literal 100%. Doing the full regression manually is not a solution due to the effort needed and spending a few days of work doing so before each release would be an extreme waste of workforce. Our idea? Use a screenshot comparator, with a bit of data science flavour. First of all, we need to store a valid state of an application to assert if there have been any changes. As covering the whole application with test cases is time-consuming, we have thought about a different document covering the whole application - the sitemap. To ensure that we will use the proper version as a model, we should test the application manually, which will take some time, but we plan to do it only once. Afterwards, we can store the state of the application by making screenshots of every page. As we have a sitemap we can go through every subpage and make a screenshot of it displayed on different browsers. When we have a base we can compare to - every time we would like to make a regression, we can make new screenshots of the application, and compare those with the base ones and if we spot a difference, we know that something is happening. This non-standard approach should be the most efficient as the applications tend to change very often and managing and replacing the screenshots is the easiest way to keep the apps up to date.'
