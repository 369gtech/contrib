description: "Logan McDonald, BuzzFeed\n\nThe talk is about the most powerful observability system SREs have at their disposal: the human mind! I draw from cognitive science to discuss how we can improve how we learn and store information about our systems in our brains in order to respond better to incidents and anomalies. It's a talk broken into four parts: preparing to learn, gaining knowledge, building mental models, and enabling a team to learn well together.\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
