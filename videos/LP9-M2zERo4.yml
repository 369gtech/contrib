This session will dig into the code behind Vast Rank's \"Ranking Map\" that provides contextual College Rankings based on what a user has in view on his or her Map. Code examples will be shown utilizing the Google Maps API, the Google Maps Marker Manager, the Google Client Geocoder, and the Google Client Location information exposed by the AJAX API loader. The session will end by discussing future plans to incorporate additional Google API's including the Translation API to translate international content, the Languages API to utilize jQuery, and the Google AJAX Search API to improve the user's search experience.\r\n\r\nFor presentation slides and all I/O sessions, please go to: code.google.com/events/io/sessions.html"
