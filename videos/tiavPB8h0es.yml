language: English
recordingDate: 1616947231
description: "Have you ever started a solo project that never really came together? Been able to write something up in a weekend but dropped it soon after? Me too! In this talk I go over how I was able to break from that and build my first CLI tool, written in Rust. Drawing from an understanding of habit formation, we’ll examine how to plan projects in a way that keeps you fulfilled and stops you from veering off track.\n\n***\n\nZeet helps anyone deploy and scale like the top tech companies, without the work.
