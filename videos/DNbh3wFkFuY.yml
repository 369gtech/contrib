Both unproducible bugs and test flakes are the result of permutations in timing, load, ordering.\n\nI want to prove that unreproducible bugs are the same thing as test flakes. And we have a massive source of data here, millions of records of test flakes.\n\nLets take a look at how the Cockpit project trains bots to correlate these flakes into unsupervised clusters. and automatically make use of the data, identifying real bugs, or simply retriggering tests. \n\nWe’ll dive into details about Normalized Compression Distance, Unsupervised Clustering, TF-IDF and many other simple techniques used to zero in on the bugs.\n\n\nStef Walter\n\nhttps://cfp.all-systems-go.io/en/ASG2018/public/events/207"
