title: 'O''Reilly Webcast: Devops Hiring - Find and hire the best candidates in a competitive job market'
recordingDate: 1378421178
description: "Having a hard time finding qualified candidates? Do critical, in-demand roles (e.g., for devops practitioners) remain unfilled for months? Are the usual hiring approaches (recruiters looking on LinkedIn) simply not working?\n\nIn this webcast, Dave Zwieback will present a new approach to recruitingâ€”devops hiring. Unlike traditional recruiting approaches, devops hiring breaks down the silos between the candidate, the recruiter, and the hiring manger by identifying and prioritizing a shared, long-term goal (employee engagement). This approach further applies core devops principles of Culture, Automation, Measurement, and Sharing to recruiting. Although devops hiring is almost certainly required to identify qualified IT candidates for organizations who've embraced the devops philosophy, it can also be effective at finding and hiring the best candidates in any competitive field.\n\nAbout Dave Zwieback\n\nDave's been managing large-scale mission-critical infrastructure and teams for 17 years.
