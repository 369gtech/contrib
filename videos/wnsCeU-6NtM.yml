description: "The Power of Visual Storytelling\n\nNatalia will be taking us through the different ways we can articulate our ideas through storytelling – turning often complex messages in pitches and campaigns into simple visual narratives in an easy to understand, memorable way, to truly engage an audience and ensure our brand is more memorable and unique. She’ll be showing us how we can come up with better ideas more quickly, using these key messages in pictures to share useful content and add ROE to the mix (Return on Engagement), which follows the always needed ROI.\n\nAbout the speaker: \nNatalia Talkowska http://natalkadesign.com – Founder of Natalka Design – creative agency specialising in visual communication working with global brands and government and founder of Doodleledo – creative social events for anyone that says 'I can't draw!' run in 20 countries around the world\n\nAbout the conference:\nAt The UX Conference on February 20th 2018 in London we were exploring how to improve collaboration between designers and business stakeholders.
