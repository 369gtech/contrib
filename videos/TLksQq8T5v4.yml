description: "Recording brought to you by American Express. https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs\nTwo years ago, #Android announced first-class support for the Kotlin programming language. Both the language and the platform evolved a lot during this time, with more focus from the engineering teams at Google on helping developers use the full power of Kotlin. In fact, we’ve seen tremendous adoption of the language among top Android app developers.\n\nThat's why, just 2 years later, we announced that, going forward, Android will become Kotlin-first.\n\nIn this talk I want to talk about the current state of Kotlin on Android, and give you a small glimpse into the future of what modern app development with Android Jetpack looks like.\n\nResources:\nKotlinConf website: https://jb.gg/fyaze5\nKotlinConf on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlinconf\n\nKotlin website: https://jb.gg/pxrsn6\nKotlin blog: https://jb.gg/7uc7ow\nKotlin on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlin\n\n#KotlinConf19 #Kotlin #JetBrains\n\nAbout the Presenter:\nI am a Developer Advocate at Google and I work primarily to support developers in building great apps using Android Studio and Kotlin, as well as teach about new Framework and Play features. I enjoy looking for ways to make apps more usable, mostly through better development patterns and code optimizations."
