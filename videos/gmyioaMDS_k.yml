title: 'The New Marketing Era, with Medialink and Silverbullet'
recordingDate: 1602143100
description: "Ciaran O'Kane, CEO at ExchangeWire is joined by Kathleen Saxton, Executive Vice President & Managing Director EMEA at MediaLink & Ian James, CEO at Silverbullet to discuss the new marketing era on this MadTech Webcast episode.\n\nDuring this session they discuss:\n- How does the panel think COVID has shifted behaviour? Are these changes ingrained - or do people think most will snap back to old routines once we get back to normal in 2021?\n- The digital marketing landscape has changed forever with the demise of third party cookies? How does the panel think this will change the way marketers look at digital marketing - particularly around targeting and measurement?\n- The post-cookie era and how businesses can achieve the ‘Holy grail’ of data, content, context and programmatic.\n- Sir Martin Sorrell and S4 Capital often talk about the “new hybrid of data, content and programmatic” – but what does this look like in practice? And in a world without cookies?"
