description: "The Space Operations Facility of FH Aachen (FHASOF) The role of freely available and open-source software in the daily operations\nby Sacha Tholl and Hannah Walther\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/AW1.120/foss_at_fhasof.webm\n\nThe space operations facility is a multi-mission ham ground station located at Aachen / Germany, which is operated by students. We perform Telemetry, Tracking, and command of own but also for foreign amateur radio satellites on a best effort basis for a purely educational purpose. Because we obtain only a very limited amount of funding, we entierly rely on the use of freeware and open-source software and the \"do it yourself experience\". In this talk, we explain why we integrate and how we use open-source software in our daily operations and what is our user experience from a missions-operator point of view.\n\n\nThis timeslot was originally for talk Channel Equalization using GNU Radio. That talk is now at 10:00 AM due to a last minute timing conflict.\n\nRoom: AW1.120\nScheduled start: 2020-02-02 13:30:00"
