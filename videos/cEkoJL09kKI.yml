description: "Let's suppose that you are developing a new application:\n\nHow to quickly detect big performance bottlenecks?\n\nHow to easily know whether the new written code is raising many SQL requests?\n\nHow to easily spot that your application might consume a lot of memory?\n\nIn this Tools-in-Action, we will show how QuickPerf can help us to quickly detect some big performance bottlenecks and remove them as soon as possible.\n\nJean is a Java software developer working at Zenika. He writes code and works on performance issues. He is also developing QuickPerf, a testing library for Java providing annotations to quickly evaluate some performance properties."
