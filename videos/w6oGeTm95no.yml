recordingDate: 1579151641
description: "Deb Goodkin\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/180/\n\nThe FreeBSD Open Source Operating System is one of the oldest, largest, and most successful open source projects, with a long history of innovation. FreeBSD descended from Berkeley Unix back in the early '90s, with its lineage dating back 50 years to the original UNIX. Itâ€™s known for its reliability, stability, and advanced networking and performance.  Deb will take you through its long history and highlight some of the features that set FreeBSD apart from other operating systems. She'll describe how the FreeBSD Project works and how you can contribute to the Project. She will point out some of the differences between FreeBSD and Linux, and share why individuals and companies use FreeBSD. In fact, she'll explain how you are most likely using FreeBSD now!\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
