recordingDate: 1571272119
description: "Building secure microservices requires mastering a variety of patterns, protocols, frameworks, and technologies. This session provides a holistic end-to-end view of how to secure microservices using industry standard protocols and Spring Security. The goal is to present how standards such as JWT, JWA, JWS, JWE, JWK, OAuth2, OpenID Connect, and TLS can be combined to make writing secure microservices easy.\n\nThe session will focus on walkthroughs/live coding showing how to apply the patterns and standards using Spring Security 5.1. The following patterns and their implementations will be demonstrated:\n\nWeb SSO Login\nimplementing OAuth2 resource servers\nimplementing edge service gateways\nToken Exchange in a microservice call chain\nToken Relay in a microservice call chain\nintegration with OpenID Connect/OAuth2 Servers\nfeatures of Spring Security 5.1 that make it easier to secure microservices\n\nSpeakers: Joe Grandja, Spring Security Senior Engineer, Pivotal and Stephen Doxsee, Software Engineer, Simple Step Solutions\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2019\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/implementing-microservices-security-patterns-protocols-with-spring-security"
