title: 'MR Speaker Series: Creating a digital twin solution with Unity & Azure Digital Twins'
language: English
recordingDate: 1633724973
description: "To make it easier for developers to create real-time digital twin solutions to drive operational efficiency, Unity and Microsoft partnered on a step-by-step Learning Path and sample application that shows how to design and construct digital twin experiences by leveraging Unity’s visualization and connectivity capabilities with Azure Digital Twins. The end project is a wind farm scenario where developers can place turbines in appropriate locations, integrate real-world GIS data, connect operational IoT data and share business metrics in mixed reality, all driving data-driven decision making.\n\nWhile we built the training to help others learn portable digital twins concepts, we also learned a great deal ourselves! We'll share development highlights, lessons & troubleshooting tips, and surprises encountered along the way.\n\nAbout the speakers:\n\nClaire Cunningham is a Senior Interaction Designer at Unity based in Dublin, Ireland. With a background in XR across a range of industries, she’s previously worked on industrial AR and created multimodal tools for city dashboards using real-time 3D.
