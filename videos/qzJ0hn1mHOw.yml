description: "In the book Bossypants, Tina Fey gives three rules of improv: 1. Always say yes, 2. Say yes, and, 3. Make statements. These rules are a damn good approach to dealing with the unexpected in comedy or anything else. Error handling in JavaScript, for example. The way JS deals with exceptions is already a little unpredictable - instead of fighting that, let's take advantage of it to create better user experiences, more powerful services, and room for hacks and happy accidents.\n\nFor reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
