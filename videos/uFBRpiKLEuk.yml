description: "About Paul Canetti:\nPaul Canetti comes from a publishing design background and has worked in the art departments of publications such as SELF and Gotham magazines. He transitioned into web and user interface design before landing at Apple Inc. in 2006, a year before the iPhone was released. He eventually left Apple to combine his passion for technology with publishing, founding MagAppZine in 2010. MagAppZine is a do-it-yourself platform that allows publishers of all shapes and sizes to create and manage apps quickly, easily, and affordably.\n\nAbout Rochelle Grayson:\nRochelle Grayson, CEO of BookRiff, is a serial entrepreneur and digital media executive with 20 years experience in business, technology, consumer media, and education. She has led and launched several startups and innovative media initiatives, working with a combination of both highly analytical and creative individuals. Rochelle is equally comfortable discussing digital media business models, social media trends, online community building, and internet and mobile technologies.\n\nSince 2008, Rochelle has been nominated as one of Canada's Top 100 Most Powerful Women, named \"The New Executive Cool Hunter\" by Canadian Business Magazine, awarded Vancouver's Top Forty Under 40, and listed as one of Vancouver's Top 10 Technology Women.\n\nAbout Craig Tashman:\nCraig Tashman, founder of LiquidText, has done basic technology research and development at several institutions, including IBM, Microsoft Research, and Georgia Tech. His work has spanned fields ranging from three dimensional imaging and computer security, to project management and data compression. In 2005, Craig began doctoral research at Georgia Tech that led him to explore how multitouch interfaces could enable more efficient, expressive ways to work with text documents. This research led to LiquidText, which uses fluid, multitouch interaction to let people read long, complex documents more quickly and easily."
