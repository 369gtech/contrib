It is blazingly fast and it hides almost all of the complexity from the user. In a nutshell,\n it works. At least, that is, until it doesn't work, or doesn't work as one would expect it to work. Then we are left digging into Lucene internals or asking\nfor help on java-user@lucene.apache.org to figure out why a document with five of our query terms scores lower than a different document with only one of the\nquery terms.\n\nIn this video you will learn about the following topics -\n1.What is Scoring\n2.Scoring - Simmilarities/Weights/Scores\n3.Scoring - TFIDF Weights/ScOres\n4.Scoring - Score Boosting\n5.Scoring - Index Time Boosting\n\nRelated post:\nhttp://www.edureka.co/blog/apache-solr-shedding-some-light/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=lucene-score\nhttp://www.edureka.co/blog/solr30thoct?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=lucene-score\n\nEdureka is a New Age e-learning platform that provides Instructor-Led Live, Online classes for learners who would prefer a hassle free and self paced learning\n environment, accessible from any part of the world.\n The topics related to ‘Apache Solr & Lucene' have been covered in our course ‘Apache Solr‘.
