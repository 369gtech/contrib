title: 'Building and Distributing Android SDK Add-Ons'

description: "Since Google Play Services took much of the thunder away from the Google APIs SDK targets, SDK Add-ons have fallen a bit out of the mainstream thought of Android developers. However, if you are an OEM of an Android-based product (especially one that may not be in the consumer space), then SDK Add-ons are worth another look.\n\nThe following is Dave Smith's session at this year's Android Builder's Summit. It will give you a flavor for how they work and why they are so useful to embedded developers and OEMs.\n\nFull tutorial here: http://crcl.to/px621\n\nWant to learn more and dive deeper into AOSP and building your own SDK?
