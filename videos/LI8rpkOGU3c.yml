description: "The Collections Framework was introduced in JDK 1.2 back in 1998 and is still in heavy use today. Although its fundamentals remain unchanged, it has evolved considerably since its introduction, and it continues to evolve. This session describes some of the recent enhancements made to Collections, with a focus on the enhancements added to Java 9. Of particular note is JEP 269, Convenience Factory Methods, a library-based API that serves the purpose of collection literals. The session also covers some minor streams enhancements in Java 9. Finally, the session provides a glimpse at some possible future enhancements for the Collections Framework and to the Streams API.\n\n# Stuart Marks\nStuart Marks is a Principal Member of Technical Staff in the Java Platform Group at Oracle.
