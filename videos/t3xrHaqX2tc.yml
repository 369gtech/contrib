description: "Many of us have worked with abstractions over Web technologies such as HTTP, but REST, HTML5, and WebSocket are requiring us to understand how the Web really works. What actually happens when a Web browser opens a Web page? What is the connection between session state and cookies? How do HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together? This session starts at the beginning and walks through the Webâ€™s fundamental building blocks.\n\n\nAuthor:\nJames Ward\nJames Ward is a Technical Evangelist for Flex at Adobe and Adobe's JCP representative to JSR 286, 299, and 301. Much like his love for climbing mountains he enjoys programming because it provides endless new discoveries, elegant workarounds, summits and valleys. His adventures in climbing have taken him many places. Likewise, technology has brought him many adventures, including: Pascal and Assembly back in the early 90's; Perl, HTML, and JavaScript in the mid 90's; then Java and many of it's frameworks beginning in the late 90's. Today he primarily uses Flex to build beautiful front-ends for Java based back-ends. Prior to Adobe, James built a rich marketing and customer service portal for Pillar Data Systems.\nView more trainings by James Ward at https://www.parleys.com/author/james-ward\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
