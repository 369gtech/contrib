description: "droidcon Italy webinar\n7 July 2020 \nCris Pintea, CTO & Founder, Usophy\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/secret/JcweaHS0ibGKuv\n\nGigantic codebases, complex people interdependencies, painful deployments, technological lockdown… Does it sound familiar? Those are the pitfalls of typical monolithic frontends. After facing them all, at my company, we started looking at potential solutions, and we were pleasantly surprised by what the community has come up with. For us, micro-frontends are solving all these problems and more, and in this webinar, I’d like to tell you all about it.\n\nWe’ll look at what micro-frontends are, where the idea comes from, how they work, how they solve the aforementioned problems, and how, for us, they are making it less expensive to build better software. Finally, I will give you some resources to help you start implementing it right away!\n\nhttps://it.droidcon.com/2020/\nhttps://twitter.com/Droidconit\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/showcase/dro...\nhttps://www.instagram.com/droidconit/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/droidconIt"
