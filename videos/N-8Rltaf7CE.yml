description: "Having a software factory is pretty much mandatory these days. The whole point it to help you reduce your feedback loop and make sure you can deliver the right software at the right time.\n\nThis is something we have understood at Clever Cloud so we will show you how we deploy a full software factory under 15 minutes. That is to say a CI environment, a binary repository, a chat system among other things using common open source software."
