description: "From Velocity Amsterdam 2015: Everyone loves talking about different stacks used in migrating applications to DevOps methodologies, but the most important and valuable change is not a technology stack; instead, it is the human stack.\n\nIn this keynote address, we will cover the intersection of technology and humans, and walk the audience through a real life example of the move of Firefox crash reporter. The three engineers tasked with this had to build the plane while it was in the air, all without landing or crashing.\n\nAs with many projects, hard deadlines and requirements made the team work through a lot of tough decisions and compromises while simultaneously training devs, product managers, managers, and other engineers in the new world of DevOps and Continuous Delivery.\n\nAbout JP Schneider (Mozilla):\nJP was one of five Threadless alums who moved to build President Obama’s reelection technology stack for the 2012 campaign. Since then, he has worked as DevOps/Internet Jedi for Mozilla, helping multiple teams move to modern infrastructure and process tooling.\n\nAbout Daniel Maher (Mozilla):\nDan is a long-time system administrator – he first installed Linux on his home PC in 1995 and never looked back. A veteran of the original dotcom bubble, he founded a web hosting company in the late 90’s, and managed it from inception to acquisition. Since then, he has worked in a variety of environments from start-ups to global corporations, including as an administrator at Ubisoft Montréal, and as a lecturer at the University of Winnipeg.\n\nToday, Dan is a web engineer at Mozilla, a role that allows him to work on a wide variety of cutting-edge open source technologies at very large scales.\n\nWatch more from Velocity Amsterdam 2015: https://goo.gl/RjGAuw\nVisit the Velocity website: http://velocityconf.com/\nDon't miss an upload!
