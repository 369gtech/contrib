title: 'Brian Holt - Promise to Not Use Promises: Observables in ES.next'
recordingDate: 1475490404
description: "\"Promise to Not Use Promises: Observables in ES.next\"\n\nES6’s native support for Promises landed just late enough for Brian Holt to realize that he should never use them. He’ll explain how Observables, a spec that forms the basis of RxJS and is in ongoing discussion to perhaps land in ES.next, made him see the light. Brian outlines what Observables are, how to use Observables in code today using RxJS, how Observables can totally eclipse the use of Promises, and what the state of the Observable spec is for native JavaScript. Participants will leave with the knowledge of a forthcoming tool they can add now to their toolbox."
