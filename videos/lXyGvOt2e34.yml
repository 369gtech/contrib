title: 'ElixirConf 2021 - Sheharyar Naseer - Powering real-time collab with Phoenix and Operational xform'
language: English
recordingDate: 1635129200
description: "Ever wondered how you can build something like Google Docs? Using Elixir’s powerful fault-tolerance and concurrency capabilities along with Phoenix’s excellent support for building real-time systems out-of-the-box, these two are all you need to know to build your own real-time collaboration app.\n\nWith our experience and learnings building Slab compressed into the talk, the goal is to get you going quickly by choosing the right™️ approach and tools. We’ll also use Operational Transform, a collaboration, and consistency architecture to ensure reliability and scalability when coauthoring. Starting with a basic plain-text implementation on the frontend, we’ll also show how to support formatting and more using an advanced editor like Quill.js.\n\nSome Assembly Required: To get the most out of this session, you must be comfortable writing code in Elixir and Phoenix, and ideally, have at least some understanding of OTP and websockets."
