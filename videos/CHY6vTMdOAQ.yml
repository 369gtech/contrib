title: 'DSL at Scale: Source-Code Based Orchestration - Electric Cloud'

description: "DSL at Scale: Source-Code Based Orchestration\n\nGreg Maxey, Solution Engineer, Electric Cloud\nLaurent Rochette, Solutions Architect, Electric Cloud\n\nAt last year’s DOES conference, we introduced the new Domain Specific Language (DSL) for Electric Flow and painted a vision for how it could revolutionize application release automation (ARA) for very large enterprise implementations. \n\nWe are pleased to share with you our experiences and learnings from such a large scale implementation in a financial services company that we’ve been working on this past year. This is a very large implementation—hundreds of ‘platforms’, each containing hundreds of application components each targeting hundreds of ‘device types’, that is, thousands of components distributed across tens of thousands of end points in data centers across the world. \n\nBecause of regulatory and quality concerns, complex multi-environment stage testing and promotion systems with clear separation of duties must be enforced. While Electric Flow provided the core functionality to achieve these goals, there was a considerable amount of customization required to support legacy applications, tools and processes. All of the custom work done by the Electric Cloud professional services teams was done in DSL, that is, source code first. Customizations are maintained in a source control system and applied to the various staging environments through automated script execution managed by Electric Flow. While the Electric Flow UI was not used to author content, it was used to verify implementation and provide a convenient ways for the client to monitor progress of their application delivery. The result was a highly maintainable and scalable implementation that could be customized and adjusted on a moment’s notice. Indeed, the project has been managed in a lean agile manner with three week sprints.\n\nDOES16 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
