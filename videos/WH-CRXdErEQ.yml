title: 'Building a security program at Grammarly (Dmitry Tiagulskyi, Ukraine) [RU]'
recordingDate: 1577305140
description: "You are a software developer or engineering leader in a typical internet product or service company. You have web, mobile, or native apps for different platforms, and your backends run in the cloud. You embrace test-driven development, rapid iterations, infrastructure as code, continuous delivery, and monitoring.\n\nBut what about security? Someday your users, your clients, or your CEO will ask this question. Maybe there is another breach in the news. Or someone has sent you a vulnerability report to security@yourcompany.com. Wait—do you even have security@yourcompany.com mailbox?\n\nIn a big enterprise, someone takes care of security for you. In a growing product internet company, you must implement it from scratch.\n\nIn this talk, I’ll show how to begin focusing on practical things that worked for us at Grammarly. We will talk about:\n\n– How much “security” is enough?\n– When to build a security team and how to establish roles and structure.\n– Working with external consulting and penetration testers.\n– How to launch a bug bounty program and make the most of it.\n– How a security team interacts with development teams in a non-blocking way.\n– What if your DevOps (or NoOps) teams release features and experiments multiple times per day?\n– Infrastructure, tools, monitoring, and automation for DevSecOps."
