description: "Learn how to write microservices as small, single-purpose Node.js functions that execute quickly and automatically scale. Google Cloud Functions can be invoked directly or can automatically respond to cloud events like file storage events and Pub/Sub messages. Best of all, do it all without managing servers or runtime environments.\n\nThis talk will walk through the goals of Google Cloud Functions with a high level introduction followed by a real world example showing how to deploy from GitHub.\n\nBret McGowen is on the Google Cloud Platform team at Google, focusing on developer-oriented products like App Engine, Compute Engine, the Cloud Vision API, Firebase and more. He's currently an aspiring Node.js developer. Prior to Google, Bret came from Texas, having worked in the cloud industry at Rackspace as a software engineer building the RackConnect hybrid hosting product. Before that, he led engineering teams at e-commerce, non-profit and startup companies. He's often on the running trail, volleyball court or kickball field.\n\nBret earned a bachelor’s degree in computer science from Texas A&M University.\n\n[TXP-1648]"
