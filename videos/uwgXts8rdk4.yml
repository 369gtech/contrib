description: "Great science begins with great observations. In order to get this information out to the public, organizations around the world are seeking out the brightest talent to increase productivity, hence gaining customers and keeping them. This keynote will explain the connection between the ever-growing world of digital media and developers. It is the virtual, plus literal machinery that drives the delivery of news and weather content to the world. Understanding this link will bring insight on how the impact of natural disasters can be reduced through technology.\n\nDevelopers will also be given an opportunity to innovate and join the Challenge Community. “Call for Code” has been an incredible initiative to create projects that prepare communities for natural disasters. Meanwhile, the Global High-Resolution Atmospheric Forecasting System (GRAF) is paving the way for everyone in the world to have access to the best weather data.\n\nDanielle Banks\nweather.com\n\nRecorded at Jfokus 2020 in Stockholm 4th of february\nhttp://www.jfokus.se"
