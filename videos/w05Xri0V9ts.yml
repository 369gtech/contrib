description: "Modern application architecture has evolved from monolithic to micro service based. Six years ago the most monolithic of monoliths of application servers (WebSphere Application Server) went on a similar journey to create WebSphere Liberty. Now Enterprise Java is starting down a similar path. In this 15 minute talk the lead developer for Liberty will go over the journey the development team went through and how that intersects with the new Micro Profile feature.\n\nAlasdair Nottingham has been developing Java middleware for as long as java.util.Map has existed. Despite being a Millennial he has used a rotary phone, VCR, knows what to do with a cassette tape and pencil and can remember the sound of a 54Mbps modem connecting. As is common with most successful developers in large corporations these days he finds time writing code is more limited than he would like, but speaking at conferences like Devoxx give him an excellent opportunity to go back and write code and then talk about what he has been getting his peers to do.\n\n[MZH-4825]"
