title: 'The CI/CD Experience: Kubernetes Edition with Cora Iberkleid and Andreas Evers'
language: English
recordingDate: 1593460315
description: "With Kubernetes, everything from deployment to monitoring to scaling is more standardized and inherently easier to automate. This presents the possibility to achieve a more effective and comprehensive Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) experience. We can incorporate the practice of infrastructure-as-code and take advantage of a flourishing ecosystem of tools to improve and fully automate our application deployment strategies. In this session, we'll tour the landscape of new Kubernetes-centric tooling, including Tekton, Kustomize, and ArgoCD. We'll also explore how GitOps can be leveraged for CI/CD.\n\n====\n\nCora Iberkleid\n@ciberkleid\n\nCora Iberkleid is an Advisory Cloud Application and Platform Architect at VMware, where she helps enterprises leverage modern technologies like Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, and Cloud Foundry in order to deliver better quality software faster.
