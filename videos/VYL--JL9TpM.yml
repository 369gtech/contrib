description: "A Tale of Two Rotations Building a Humane & Effective On Call\n\nNick Lee, Uber\n\nEveryone wants to provide excellent and reliable service to their customers, but the world is a messy place. Things will break for reasons inside and outside of your control, and for the most unexpected reasons. At the end of the day, someone is going to be the on-call and step in to restore order to keep customers happy.\n\nThe question is, how do you keep your on-call as happy as your customers?\n\nThis talk examines how highly critical on-call rotations that protect core functionality can be made extremely effective and low-stress, and how completely ordinary rotations can get out of hand. Weâ€™ll discuss how best practices from the first rotation were successfully applied to the second, and how to apply them in your own rotation. \n\nView the full SREcon19 Europe/Middle East/Africa Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon19emea/program \n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
