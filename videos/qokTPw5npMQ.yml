description: "Recording brought to you by American Express https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs\nEspecially if you're coming from Java—prescriptive, formal, and full of boilerplate—Kotlin bursts with expressive freedom. But how should we exercise this freedom? How concise is too concise? (Surely not as concise as Perl.) How should we choose new language features, and how to mix our code with third party DSLs? When to omit optional features—and when to keep them in? Moreover, what is our ultimate goal? Is it brevity and ease of expression when writing code? Maintainability? Interoperability? Consistency? Or are we trying to write the next great Kotlin novel?\n\nThis talk begins where the official Kotlin style guides end. Based on opinionated principles of great writing for the English language, from books like \"On Writing Well\" by William Zinsser, \"On Writing\" by Steven King, \"What I Talk About When I Talk About Running\" by Haruki Murakami, and more, this talk will explore what it means to write great code, by proposing what it means to write great Kotlin.\n\nAbout the Presenter:\nLisa Wray is a mobile developer, speaker, and advocate specializing in user interfaces. She has a B.S. from M.I.T. in music and computer science, and is a Google Developer Expert for Android. She currently works at Present (present.co), a local social network, and previously worked at Google, the New York Times, and Genius. She currently lives in Seattle."
