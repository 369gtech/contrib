title: 'TypeScript Decorators - Higher Order Functions in Disguise - Damjan Vujnovic'
recordingDate: 1534167918
description: "Decorators are very useful, but under-appreciated feature of TypeScript.\nAfter a gentle introduction to TypeScript decorators and decorator factorios, we'll demonstrate how we can use them to encapsulate \"orthogonal\" concepts (such as logging/analytics, caching, operation progress and timeouts) in a clean, non-obtrusive way."
