description: "PyData DC 2018 \n\nPython offers a variety of ways to define functions, and function-like objects, commonly known as \"Callable.\" There are a number of common design patterns, and it helps to see them side-by-side to help choose among the alternatives. We'll look at functions, higher-order functions, lambdas, callable objects, generators. And more.\n\n===\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
