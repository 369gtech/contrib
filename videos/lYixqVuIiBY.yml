description: "BOSH CLI v2: the evolution of the BOSH command line interface - Shatarupa Nandi & Danny Berger, Pivotal    \n\nBOSH operators spend an enormous amount of time using the bosh command line interface (CLI). Any interaction with BOSH or the clusters it manages, is essentially an invocation of the CLI with some parameters. While the current Ruby-based CLI has served the community well, it suffered from many shortcomings. Some important ones are: \n- It is slow and difficult to install (especially on Windows)\n- It lacked a consistent user experience when using the commands\nAdditionally, BOSH init (replacement for micro BOSH) introduced it's own CLI. \n\nTo remedy these issues and streamline the BOSH operator's experience, the BOSH team has created a new, Golang-based, CLI which addresses existing feedback and:\n- Adds enhancements to existing commands\n- Encourages more secure usage patterns\n- Reduces the need for several different manifest generation tools\n- Provides a Golang-based client to securely access the BOSH Director API\n\nThis talk will provide a complete overview of BOSH CLI v2, including discussions on how to migrate your environments and scripts to the next evolution of the CLI. It will also introduce the audience to 'bosh-deployment', the preferred way of installing the BOSH Director.\n\nShatarupa Nandi\nSoftware Engineer, Pivotal, Inc.\nShatarupa Nandi is an Engineering Director at Pivotal. She is passionate about open source and is a core contributor to Cloud Foundry BOSH. She presented a talk about 'Streamlining the BOSH experience' last yearâ€™s Cloud Foundry Summit.\n\n\nDanny Berger\nPivotal\nSoftware Engineer\nSan Francisco, CA\nWebsitehttps://dpb587.me\nDanny is a software engineer at heart who has worn many hats across several different industries with the goal of making sure businesses can succeed technically. He first discovered BOSH when researching open source infrastructure management tools, and soon he was creating BOSH releases and managing production environments with it. Eventually he found his way to Pivotal where he is a Software Engineer on the BOSH Core team who enjoys demystifying BOSH and its eccentricities."
