title: 'Real Time Fraud Detection with Stateful Functions'
recordingDate: 1635787803
description: 'We built a solution for Webshops that offers Real Time Fraud and Bot Detection based on Expert Knowlegde as well as Machine Learning. The application leverages Flink Stateful Function features to provide separation of concerns between Stream Processing and Domain Knowledge as well as zero downtime deployment of new Security Knowledge. The architecture also incorporates the interplay between regular Flink components and Flink Stateful Functions components. Multiple Sources of information (Log-Files, Web-Tracking Events, ...) can be incorporated in order to increase the quality of the Fraud Detection. A real time fraud assessment of every running session is provided as an output of the application for consumption by back-office security processes.'
