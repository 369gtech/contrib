This talk will discuss our experience of rolling out a sidecar to an extremely large fleet, the precautions that we took to make the rollout safe, and the benefits we've gained from this architecture. We will also describe how we continue to update our sidecar in a safe way for such a large fleet, and the lessons we've learned and problems we've solved along the way."
