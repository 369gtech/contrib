description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nUnderstanding Service Mesh Metric Merging- Lawrence Gadban, Solo.io\n\nObservability is a key tenet of any service mesh so each mesh implementation provides several features around observing the state of your mesh. One important aspect of observability is the exporting of metrics which enable operators or service owners to monitor both application and service mesh behavior. However, with service meshes that utilize a sidecar proxy, the exporting of metrics from both the application and the proxy itself is not as straightforward as it seems. In this session we will explore the challenge of consistently and transparently exporting metrics for all components comprising a service mesh workload. We will then dive into how Istio solves this problem with its “metrics merging” feature. This feature provides a simple way of exporting an aggregated set of metrics from all of the pieces in a sidecar-injected workload, including metrics from the Istio agent, sidecar Envoy proxy, and application workload itself. Attendees will leave with a clear picture of why metrics merging is important in general as well as how it works in the Istio service mesh."
