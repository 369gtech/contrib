title: 'Rich Caruana - Friends Don''t Let Friends Deploy Black-Box Models'
recordingDate: 1608291420
description: 'In machine learning sometimes a tradeoff must be made between accuracy and intelligibility: the most accurate models often are not very intelligible, and the most intelligible models usually are less accurate. This can limit the accuracy of models that can safely be deployed in mission-critical applications such as healthcare where being able to understand, validate, edit, and ultimately trust a model is important. Rich and his co-workers have developed a learning method based on generalized additive models (GAMs) that is as accurate as full complexity models, but even more intelligible than linear models.  This makes it easy to understand what a model has learned and to edit the model when it learns inappropriate things.  In the talk Rich presents case studies where high-accuracy GAMs discover surprising patterns in data that would have made deploying a black-box model risky.  Rich also shows how we can learn new medical science from the models.  And at the end he also show a few findings about COVID-19 that they discovered from intelligible models trained to predict C19 mortality.  Every data set is hiding good and bad secrets --- you need intelligibility to uncover those secrets, repair the bad ones, and learn from the good ones.'
