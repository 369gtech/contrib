description: "Improving Availability for Stateful Applications in Kubernetes - Michelle Au, Google \n\nOver 40% of Kubernetes clusters run stateful applications. However, there are still challenges with deployment, especially with choosing a storage backend that is best suited to support your application across multiple failure domains.    In this talk, we will discuss improvements that make it easier to run stateful applications across multiple failure domains for increased availability, and demonstrate how Kubernetes automatically recovers from failure scenarios at the node and zone layers. We will also discuss different categories of storage and their pros and cons in these failure scenarios.     You will walk away with a better understanding of Kubernetes’ scheduling and failure recovery capabilities with respect to stateful workloads, and which types of storage backends are most appropriate to meet your stateful application’s availability, reliability, and performance goals. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPfh"
