description: "Talk \nData scientists often need to get data from different websites (e.g. Yelp, Twitter, Spotify) via their Web APIs. In this talk, we will present DataPrep.connector, a unified API wrapper in Python. It enables data scientists to get data from different websites using the same programming interface, significantly simplifying web data collection. This talk will be of interest to all data scientists.\n\nSpeaker\nPei Wang is a Ph.D. student in Database System Lab(DSL), School of Computing Science, Simon Fraser University, advised by Prof. Jiannan Wang. My research interest lies in data enrichment, data extraction, and data integration related topics. I got my master degree from Nagoya University, where I was a member of the DBlab, and was advised by Prof. Chuan Xiao and Prof. Ishikawa Yoshiharu. And I got my bachelor degree from Xiâ€™an Jiaotong University. I interned at Microsoft Research DMX group and at Amazon Product Graph team. I published papers on top database conferences like SIGMOD.\n\nWeiyuan is a Ph.D. student from SFU Data Science Research Group (http://data.cs.sfu.ca/). His research interests include Data Management, ML Debugging, and applying Machine Learning to real problems. Currently, he is leading the DataPrep project (https://github.com/sfu-db/dataprep), a Python library collection for doing data preparation.\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
