description: "Elections in the US rely heavily on software. Whether we cast our votes using a computer, or on paper ballots that are then scanned, software interprets our votes, counts them, tabulates the results and calls the winner. Almost all of this software is proprietary, and owned by a handful of large companies.\n\nA few jurisdictions have plans to move to open source software, are funding its development, or are already using it. I'll give an overview of open source software projects for election-related software around the US, with a focus on San Francisco's project, where I'm on the Technical Advisory Committee.\n\nRoan Kattouw"
