description: 'In the past two years, we changed Java in three ways that we never have before: We modularized the platform, we removed some components, and we accelerated the pace of new releases. These changes aim to keep Java vibrant in an ever-changing world of competing platforms and new styles of application deployment, whether to the cloud or to app stores. Weâ€™ll see why these changes are not as disruptive as you may think, and demonstrate some of the recent and future additions to the language and the platform.'
