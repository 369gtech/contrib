description: "When is the Cache Warm? Manufacturing a Rule of Thumb\n\nLei Zhang, Emory University; Juncheng Yang, Carnegie Mellon University; Anna Blasiak, Akamai Inc and Indigo Ag; Mike McCall, Akamai Inc and Facebook Inc; Ymir Vigfusson, Emory University\n\nThe plethora of parameters and nuanced configuration options that govern complex, large-scale caching systems restrict their designers and operators. We analyze cache warmup times that can arise in failure handling, load balancing, and cache partitioning of large-scale distributed memory and storage systems. Through simulation on traces from production CDN and storage systems, we derive rules of thumb formulas for designers and operators to use when reasoning about caches.\n\nView the full HotCloud '20 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/hotcloud20/workshop-program"
