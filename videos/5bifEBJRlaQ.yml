description: "While Teams Drives are a new solution created to help teams & organizations better manage their files, using Team Drives as a developer won’t require you to learn something completely new. The Google Drive API you know & love is already “Team Drives-enabled.” Yes, there are new method collections to help you manage Team Drives programmatically, but most other Team Drive file operations can be performed with the existing Drive API methods. In this video, Google engineer Wesley Chun gives a high-level overview of Team Drives from a developer perspective, then gets you started with a sample app covering some basic Team Drives operations.\n\nRelated links for this episode:\nCode deep dive blog post: https://goo.gl/Qn079c\nTeam Drives launch post at Cloud Next 2017: https://goo.gl/rqYJPq\n“Team Drives: collaborative, enterprise file server in the cloud” Cloud Next 2017 video: https://goo.gl/6QxD6g\n“Building enterprise-ready apps with the Team Drives API” video: https://goo.gl/lY09WU\n“Get Started with Team Drives” tutorial: https://goo.gl/pPavDv\nTeam Drives pre-launch announcement: https://goo.gl/9vVCEh\nManage Team Drives (G Suite Administrator) help/support pages: https://goo.gl/Ehoa9Q\nAbout Team Drives: https://goo.gl/BxwAVo\nEnabling Team Drives: https://goo.gl/fETTXU\n“Uploading & Downloading Files with the Google Drive API” post & DevByte video: https://goo.gl/rAJCJr\n“File Storage in the Cloud” Google Drive and Google Cloud Storage DevByte video: https://goo.gl/rr3m5W\nGoogle Slides API post & DevByte video (Google Drive API demo of file query & copy): https://goo.gl/fSnCHR\n“Listing your files in Google Drive” DevByte video: https://goo.gl/a6i9ci\n“Partial response with the Google Drive API” docs page: https://goo.gl/UUkHU8\n“Setting up new Google API projects” DevByte video: https://goo.gl/grggHA\nGoogle Developers Console: http://console.developers.google.com\nGoogle APIs Client Libraries: https://goo.gl/oifAYu\n“Common Python code walkthrough” DevByte video: https://goo.gl/1KFUif\nG Suite Dev Show video series playlist: http://goo.gl/JpBQ40\nLaunchpad Online developer video series: http://goo.gl/kFMUa6\n\nSubscribe to the Google Developers Channel: http://goo.gl/mQyv5L"
