description: "The lambda calculus is wonderfully concrete and reductionist in nature. Abstractions are anonymous and volatile, they disappear as soon as you apply them. As a consequence, there is no such thing as self-reference in lambda calculus. This is a challenge that we should make a point of fixing. Why? Since recursion is such a useful and powerful tool in programming! In this talk, we will see how we can use self-reproduction as a substitute for self-reference, enabling us to generate as much recursion as we need - and hopefully no more.\n\nDetails here: http://www.codemesh.io/codemesh2017/jonas-winje\nDetails here: http://www.codemesh.io/codemesh2017/einar-host"
