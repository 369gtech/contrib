description: "Cloud computing has radically changed the way we look at software development, and it is now easier than ever to use PaaS to ship applications to production. However, building multi-container applications, setting up the necessary cloud components, and dealing with management of application secrets can be a consuming job.\n\nThis presentation will show how Hafslund effortlessly solve these challenges by building multi-container applications with .NET Core, Docker Compose and Docker Swarm, encrypting application secrets with the Moonshine framework, scripting Azure environments with the Lunaform framework, and how all of it are shipped to production in no time with Kubernetes."
