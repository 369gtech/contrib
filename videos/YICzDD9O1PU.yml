description: "From the 2014 Solid Conference: There have been many articles written about hardware startups, but little in the way of analysis of trends in the ecosystem based on funding and crowdfunding data. This presentation will be similar to this blog post (with updated data and deeper sector analysis). It will cover the what and the why underlying the growth of various subsets of the hardware startup ecosystem: robotics, connected devices, wearables, and designed products.\n\nAbout Renee DiResta (O'Reilly AlphaTech Ventures):\nRenee DiResta is a Principal at O'Reilly AlphaTech Ventures (OATV), where she evaluates innovative technologies and makes seed-stage investments. Prior to joining OATV in June of 2011, Renee spent seven as a trader at Jane Street Capital, a quantitative proprietary trading firm in New York City.\n\nFor more information on the Solid Conference, visit http://solidcon.com.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to O'Reilly to get SolidCon videos as they release: http://goo.gl/szEauh\nStay Connected to O'Reilly Media by Email - http://goo.gl/YZSWbO\n\nFollow O'Reilly Media:\nhttp://plus.google.com/+oreillymedia\nhttps://www.facebook.com/OReilly\nhttps://twitter.com/OReillyMedia"
