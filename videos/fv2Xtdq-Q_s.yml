description: "Low Context DevOps: Improving SRE Team Culture through Defaults, Documentation, and Discipline\n\nTom Limoncelli, Stack Overflow, Inc.\n\nA low-context SRE culture is one where the info you need to do your job is available, visible, and accessible. Creating a low-context culture improves remote teamwork, new-hire onboarding, enables project hopping, and helps you better handle a page you receive at 2 am.\n\nA high-context SRE culture is one where most knowledge is unspoken, or people depend on history/experience rather than explicit telling. This can be very frustrating for new employees and a disaster in a \"\"remote only\"\"/COVID-19 team.\n\nYou'd rather work in a low-context SRE culture right? I'll explain how to lower the context using (1) the power of defaults, (2) \"\"make right easy\"\", and (3) a culture of ubiquitous documentation. I conclude with ways to get people to write documentation (even if they hate writing documentation).\n\nView the full SREcon20 Americas program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon20americas/program"
