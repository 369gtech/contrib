description: "This talk was recorded at Scala Days New York, 2016. Follow along on Twitter @scaladays and on the website for more information http://scaladays.org/.\n\nAbstract:\nAfter a fairly quiet 2015, things are heating up this year. To name just three major developments among many: A major new release, Scala 2.12, is about to be completed. The Scala Center provides a new focus point for community collaboration. And there's a new experimental platform, dotty, which lets us prototype designs for the next generation of the language.\n\nIn my talk I'd like to look a bit further ahead and focus on where I see Scala in the next 5 years, touching topics like: What is Scala's unique identity as a programming language? How should it evolve? What exciting new technologies are on the horizon?"
