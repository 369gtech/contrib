recordingDate: 1586825334
description: "Join DevOps Brisbane at https://www.meetup.com/Devops-Brisbane/\n\nKenji Suzuoki will give an overview of the Three Ways, mistakes that were made in the life of a Devops Team, and how he used the Three Ways to overcome them.\n\nAbout our presenter:\nKenji Suzuoki is a Senior DevOps Engineer at Fugro. He spent the majority of his time doing Linux support and administration before he joined Fugro in 2015 and began his DevOps journey. He has witnessed how the organisation transformed with DevOps practices and methodologies and is now a big believer in DevOps. He has been involved in projects such as codifying the set up of one of the mission critical production servers, setting up automated deployment system, introducing Infrastructure as Code and so on.\n\nOutside of work, he enjoys playing soccer and occasionally dreaming of becoming the next Messi then quickly realises he should keep it realistic."
