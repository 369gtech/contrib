It is accelerated with the CUDA platform from NVIDIA and also uses CUDA-related libraries, including cuBLAS, cuDNN, cuRAND, cuSOLVER, cuSPARSE, and NCCL, to make full use of the GPU architecture. CuPy's interface is highly compatible with NumPy; in most cases it can be used as a drop-in replacement. CuPy supports various methods, data types, indexing, broadcasting, and more.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2018 and https://github.com/PyCon/2018-slides"
