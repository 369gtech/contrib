language: English
recordingDate: 1461594030
description: "There are many great resources for getting started with Functional Reactive Programming and ReactiveCocoa, but what’s the next step? ReactiveCocoa is not just a nice wrapper for KVO, Signals can be used to model many common problems in Cocoa including managing the state of your UI, notifications and even business logic. Adopting ReactiveCocoa can make for more modular, self-documenting code — while still integrating easily with other APIs and your existing code. We would like to share with you some interesting, practical examples where we’ve used ReactiveCocoa to solve problems in our app. Our goal is to inspire you to consider how ReactiveCocoa can be applied in your own apps.\n\nJeames is a developer, singer, and wantreprenuer currently working on awesome apps as a software engineer at Outware Mobile in Melbourne. He has had a growing love affair with iOS for a few years now and is passionate about all aspects of software design and architecture.\n\nMark is an app developer with over 5 years of commercial experience, developing over 30 apps for iOS and Android. Mark is passionate about the possibilities offered by mobile technology and touch screen devices.\n\nFor more on YOW! Connected, visit http://connected.yowconference.com.au"
