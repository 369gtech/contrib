description: "Stratos UI - An Open Source UI for Cloud Foundry - Troy Topnik, SUSE\n\nAt the last CF Summit, SUSE introduced Stratos UI - an Open-Source, modern, web-based Management UI aimed at meeting the needs of both Developers and Administrators.\n\nSince then Stratos UI has been accepted for incubation in the CF-Extensions PMC.\n\nIn this talk we will present a refresher on Stratos UI, introduce its features, and provide an update on the work done in the last 6 months.\n\nThis talk is aimed at both end-users and developers. We present Stratos with the intent of raising awareness, growing the user base, and encouraging others to join in and contribute. \n\nAbout Troy Topnik\nTroy is a Senior Product Manager responsible for SUSE Cloud Application Platform. He began working with Cloud Foundry shortly after its open source debut in 2011, and has been a technical writer, instructor, and product manager with the ActiveState and HPE Helion Stackato teams."
