title: 'Let''s Build a Quantum Classifier! LIVE'
language: English

description: "Quantum Machine Learning may sounds daunting to most people, but it's way more fun to learn about than Classical Machine Learning. Creative algorithms that leverage concepts like quantum entanglement and superposition are already being studied by various teams to enable new solutions in fields like Chemistry, Finance, Supply Chain, and Energy. In this 1 hour game show, i'm going to attempt to build a quantum classifier that predicts input output pairs using the PennyLane python library. But I'll need your help! I'll ask for your help throughout the stream, and you'll have to interactively answer my questions. Together, let's see if we can build something somewhat useful. Oh, and at end one winner gets $500 cash, a song tribute by me, and early access to the Code Royale mobile and PC game. See you then \n\nPlease Subscribe! And Like. And Comment. That's what keeps me going.\n\nAnswer live questions here:\nhttps://itempool.com/llsourcell/live\n\nRead through PennyLane's Quantum Machine Learning docs to prepare yourself and come Friday, let the games begin:\nhttps://pennylane.ai/qml/\n\nLearn Machine Learning in 3 Months for free:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch/Cr6VqTRO1v0"
