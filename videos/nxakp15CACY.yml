description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2015\nPresenter: Sergi Almar\nWeb /Javascript Track\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/from-zero-to-hero-with-spring-websocket\n\nReal-time has changed the way we interact with the web, we demand information in real-time. Join Sergi Almar in this presentation to learn how to progressively enhance your traditional Spring MVC application with real-time functionalities for a more interactive and engaging user experience. Starting by adding server push notifications with Server-sent Events (supported in the new Spring 4.2) we will move to a bidirectional messaging communication style with WebSockets. Going real-time couldn't be easier with Spring! We will also see the challenges and considerations to take into account when scaling our WebSocket application and deploy it to Cloud Foundry."
