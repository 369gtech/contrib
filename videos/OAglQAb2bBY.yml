description: "JCov has been measuring Java code coverage since 1997. This JDK code coverage tool supports cutting-edge JDK features; offers power, flexibility, and scalability; and is now open-source. The goal of this session is to show what problems need to be solved by code coverage analysis, from evaluating the code coverage level to prioritizing areas for testing. It demonstrates how JCov can be applied to solve such problems effectively. It also goes through its unique features, such as\n\n&bull; Per-test coverage tracking\n\n&bull; Scalability over application size and test suite size\n\n&bull; Command-line interface\n\n&bull; Public API for custom data processing\n\n\nAuthor:\nAleksandre Iline\nAlexandre Iline is a senior quality engineer in Oracle, working as a quality architect on several products in Java portfolio and as a test tools architect for the Java SQE.
