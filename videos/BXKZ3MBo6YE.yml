description: "by Arne Padmos\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/UA2.114/security_threat_modelling_for_developers.webm\n\nWhat threats do we need to take into account when building a system? A key method for answering this question is an approach called threat modelling, whereby security problems can be anticipated during the design phase. This talk discusses major threat-modelling approaches, and includes concrete examples of how to apply them to software-intensive systems.\n\nRoom: UA2.114 (Baudoux)\nScheduled start: 2020-02-01 09:30:00"
