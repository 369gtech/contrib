title: 'Tanzu Talk: Addressing infrastructure debt, start with small apps'
language: English
recordingDate: 1601557754
description: "The best approach to modernizing your infrastructure is to start modernization with several small applications, not lengthy platform switch-overs. As Coté discusses, most organizations want to do huge, all at once change when it comes to putting in new platforms. This misses the chance to validate their requirements and needs by starting with developers. So, don't do that: start small.\n\nCoté also summerizes some of the VMware Tanzu talks from VMworld 2020, including Dormains reccomendation for the most important problem to solve for developers."
