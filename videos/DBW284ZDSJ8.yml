title: 'TensorFlow in Three Sentences - Barbara Fusinska'
recordingDate: 1506326716
description: "TensorFlow is growing in popularity as the go-to tool for Deep Learning and building complex AI systems. But there is also a lot of misconception about the capabilities of the platform and how and by whom it can be used in the most efficient way.\nIs TensorFlow the silver bullet of AI? Does one need to gain a lot of preliminary knowledge before starting to use the library or can it just be treated as a black box?\n\nIn this talk, Barbara will start with three statements and drill down into each of them to reveal the holistic view on what TensorFlow is capable of, what are the limitations and what is needed to start working with the library. The session will cover the following areas:\n- Required experience and knowledge when approaching TensorFlow\n- Principal concepts and components of the library (Tensors, GPU computing, Deep Learning)\n- Methods and applications in the AI field\nAfter the session, the audience will have a clear idea what TensorFlow is and what it is not. The attendees will be able to start their journey with the library and apply it to tackle problems like Computer Vision or Natural Language Processing."
