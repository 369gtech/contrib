description: "Although Clojure programmers should be spending most of their time thinking, we occasionally need to type to get our ideas into computers. We'll talk a bit about this history of keyboards and how Clojure (and lasers!) can be used to design and manufacture the next generation of keyboards.\n\nAbout the speaker: Matt Adereth builds tools and infrastructure for quantitative research at Two Sigma using Clojure. His first love is Mathematica, but he's happy to have found a homoiconic refuge on the JVM in Clojure. In his spare time, he obsesses over keyboards and trains his kids to sort the ridiculous collection of keyboard components he's amassed."
