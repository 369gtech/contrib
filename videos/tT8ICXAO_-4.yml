In this video I cover conditional operators, logical operators, if, else, arrays, vectors, converting strings into vectors, string stream, while loops, for loops and more. I'll also present 2 problems for you to solve, which I'll then provide the answer to.\n\nI think learning through doing is the best and the problems will keep getting more complex."
