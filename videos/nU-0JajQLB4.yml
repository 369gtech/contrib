description: "Speaker: Christian Dupuis, Atomist\nSpring Boot, the new convention-over-configuration centric framework from the Spring team at Pivotal, marries Spring's flexibility with conventional, common sense defaults to make application development move swiftly and enjoyable. It's ideally suited for building microservices and distributed systems and makes streamlining devops practices simple. Join Spring Boot contributor Eddu Melendez Gonzales for a look at what Spring Boot is, why it's turning heads, why you should consider it for your next application (REST, web, batch, big-data, integration, whatever!) and how to get started."
