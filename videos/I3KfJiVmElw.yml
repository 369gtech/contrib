description: "by Moisés Guimarães\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/UB2.252A/python2020_foxdot.webm\n\nYeah, this is about my last summer. But I promise to focus on the story of how I was able to do four amazing lightning talks with Python and a harmonica.\n\n\nThis one is not about technical stuff, it is about finding something that python overlaps with your hobbies and sharing it back to the community.\nThis talk is about writing songs and playing music with python. Back in 2017 I came to know FoxDot, a python wrapper around SuperCollider, which is a super popular open source synthesizer. Since then, I have been using it to create entertaining lighting talks and would like to cover a bit more than just a lightning talk this time.\n\nRoom: UB2.252A (Lameere)\nScheduled start: 2020-02-01 15:30:00"
