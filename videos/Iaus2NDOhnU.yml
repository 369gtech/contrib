description: "Everyone is talking about the microservices architecture, and how Docker can help DevOps deploy the services. Docker is often mentioned in conjunction with cluster managers like Kubernates, Marathon or Fleet. But, what about the secrets? The current trend increase the number of secrets required to run our services. This place a new level of maintenance on our security teams. How can we share and manage the secrets(certificates, passwords, keys) for our services in this kind of dynamic scenario; where instances are started automatically, where there are multiple instances of the same services for scalability reasons? Are you keeping up?\n\nCome to this session to see how you can manage your secrets with Vault; and make security a first class citizen in the development process."
