title: 'David Pollak - Don''t Shed a Tier for Me, Clojure'
recordingDate: 1389105420
description: "Homoiconicity is cool because the code is the data... but what happens when your data is distributed across a grid of back-end servers and you want to play with that data?\n\nPlugh is an open source log analysis tool that is written in Clojure and runs on a cluster of Riak instances.\n\nPlugh allows the user to logic programming to specify manipulation of the data sets. The same logic program is executed no matter the tier... it's compiled via ClojureScript as a Map/Reduce job on Riak, applied on the server, and even applied in the browser (once again via ClojureScript).\n\nNo need for the user to think differently across tiers (SQL for the data warehouse tier, but Excel for the desktop) because the same logic and the same code is used across all tiers.\n\nDavid Pollak founded Visi.Pro, Cloud Computing for the Rest of Us along with the Visi Language open source project. David founded the Lift Web Framework and continuously contributes to Lift.\n\nDavid wrote Beginning Scala and ran the first Scala-focused conferences. In the past David wrote software for NextStep (which has morphed into iOS) including Mesa, the world's first real-time spreadsheet. You can find David on Twitter @dpp and IRL finding good Pho restaurants or walking Archer his dog along with his kids in San Francisco."
