description: "There are three critical levels to performance-tuning Java applications. At a high level, the application needs to be coded in an efficient way. At runtime, the application needs to be allocated sufficient resources to avoid garbage collection. Finally, the JVM needs to generate efficient code for the processor to run. This presentation explains Java performance tuning, from the source code to the processor.\n\n\nAuthors:\nDarryl Gove\nDarryl Gove is a senior principal software engineer in the Solaris Studio team, working on optimising applications and benchmarks for current and future processors.
