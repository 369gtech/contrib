title: 'Optimizing grocery delivery routes using Oracle APEX, Autonomous Database and Google Maps APIs'
language: English
recordingDate: 1594985108
description: "In this special edition of APEX Office Hours, we will be joined by Santhosh Jose, who is a Principal Applications Engineer in the Oracle HCM product development organization.  During the pandemic, Santhosh volunteered his time to help deliver groceries to the elderly.  After delivering groceries a few times, he quickly realized that the list of addresses were not as efficient as they could be.  This is the classic \"Traveling Salesman\" problem in computer science (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) - what is the shortest possible route between a list of destinations?\n\nTo solve this problem, Santhosh turned to Oracle APEX & Oracle Autonomous Database to help solve this problem.  In a short amount of time, Santhosh built a fully functional \"Route Builder\" application, which, given a list of addresses, will help determine the most efficient route between those addresses.  To facilitate navigation by a driver, Santhosh also integrated Google Maps.\n\nThis session will be comprised of two parts - an introduction and background of Santhosh Jose and how he found Oracle APEX, and then a description, explanation and demonstration of the RouteBuilder app.\n\nAskTOM Office Hours offers free, monthly training and tips on how to make the most of Oracle Database, from Oracle product managers, developers and evangelists.\n\nhttps://asktom.oracle.com/ \n\nOracle Developers portal: https://developer.oracle.com/\nSign up for an Oracle Cloud trial: https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/"
