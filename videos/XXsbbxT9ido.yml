description: "Daimler supports its developers with a centrally curated DevOps toolchain, including a cloud native platform based on Cloud Foundry. The idea is to free hundreds of dev teams from operations scaffolding and allow them to instead focus on delivering their products. “Platform-as-a-product” is the strategy to keep up with the demand and the continuous feature evolution. KPIs are part of the platform. Some are consumed by the platform team to measure the success of the platform itself. Others are provided as “KPIs-as-a-service” to the platform customers. \n\nJoin Thomas Müller, from Daimler, along with Dieter Flick and Robert Werner, from VMware, to learn:\n-The transformation challenges in a large, global organization with distributed IT teams for Dev and Ops\n-What particular KPIs are useful and how to measure progress for Dev and Ops\n-What “KPIs-as-a-service” is and how a “platform-as-a -product” approach can help Dev and Ops\n-How to leverage a CN platform like CF to access the metrics\n-Demo\n\nRoland Fetscher, Platform Architect at Daimler AG \nRobert Werner, Engagement Director at VMware\nThomas Mueller, Product Owner at Daimler AG\nDieter Flick, Platform Architect at VMware\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/devops-kpis-as-a-service-daimlers-solution"
