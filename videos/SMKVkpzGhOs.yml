description: "Traditionally SOCs look outward from their network perimeters, missing the adversaries already operating in their networks. As SOCs improve their capabilities by turning inwards, where should they start? What techniques should they be worried about? What tools will help them? Without knowing what your adversaries can do and what your current capabilities are, it’s hard to make improvements.\n\nThis talk will describe how to use the MITRE ATT&CK framework as a “scorecard” within the SOC to understand and tune defensive capabilities, making it easier to answer these hard questions. We’ll describe key use cases for how SOCs can use ATT&CK, covering hunting, threat intelligence, red teaming, and security engineering. To enable these use cases, we’ll present a non-invasive technique to construct a detective coverage map that highlights the SOC’s strengths and weaknesses, focusing on minimizing resource requirements while still providing usable results. To accompany this, we describe a process to create a remediation plan that provides the highest return on investment by orienting on the most relevant threats and prioritizing defensive improvements based on current coverage. Throughout the talk, we will provide real examples, making it easy for those in attendance to understand and replicate at home."
