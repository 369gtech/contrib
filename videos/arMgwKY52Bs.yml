description: "Welcome to Designing in the Browser with our host, Una Kravets. Today we’re starting a special series on Accessibility in design. It’s very important to bake accessibility in from the start, since good structure, or bad structure, scales to your entire product. Then, see how you can give all of your users a better experience as you build and design. Today’s episode is focused on semantic markup for better content consumption by screen readers, robots, and your users overall.\n\nLinks:\nUse semantic HTML for easy keyboard wins → https://goo.gle/324ZEOM \nWeb.dev → https://goo.gle/2YJiNoG \n\nDesigning in the Browser → https://goo.gle/2NeLxjI \nSubscribe to Chrome Developers → https://goo.gle/ChromeDevs"
