description: "Let's be honest – communication between designers and developers isn't always perfect. The knowledge that comes with each discipline stems from entirely different skill sets. Designers and developers often have different priorities, even though everyone is working toward one common goal: a fantastic, delightful, functional product. At Google, we're always working on ways to bridge this gap through unified spec formats and tools, so that intricate details are never lost in translation and things get done the way they're intended the first time. Join a conversation with Google designers and engineers as they share tricks they've discovered over the years to successfully communicate and implement visual and motion design for dozens of Google products.\n\nSee all the talks from Google I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/olw6kV\nWatch more Android talks at I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/Uv3jls\nWatch more Chrome talks at I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/JoMLpB\nWatch more Firebase talks at I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/JTH9Fr \nSubscribe to the Google Developers Channel: http://goo.gl/mQyv5L \n\n#io16 #GoogleIO #GoogleIO2016"
