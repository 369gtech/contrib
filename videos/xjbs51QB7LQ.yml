description: 'Once upon a time, 512 bytes was enough memory; it was enough for the many Mariner spacecraft that visited Mercury, Mars, and the Moon. That 512 bytes taught us about the temperature of Venus and the desolation of Mars, and we rejoiced to learn how different these worlds are from anything we''d imagined. Today, there is no "enough" in astronomical data. Our modern spacecraft and ground-based telescopes demand innovation in data processing just to handle the petabytes of data we receive each day. In order to transform this flood of information into understanding, we must find creative software solutions that leverage cloud computing, borrowed human brain power, and machine learning. - Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/craft'
