description: "At Elastic — the company behind the open source tools Elasticsearch, Kibana, Beats, and Logstash — everything is distributed; both the company and all our products. Building distributed systems is notoriously hard ... building a distributed team even more so. This talk dives into the details how Elastic is thriving on its distributed model:\n\n* How Elastic started to be distributed by design.\n* Why we prefer the term distributed over remote.\n* What are our shared core values and which aspects are on an individual basis.\n* How the day of an Elastician looks like with totally different examples.\n* What our tooling looks like.\n* What we have learned as we progressed and grown to more than 600."
