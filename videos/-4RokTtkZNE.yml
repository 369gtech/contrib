language: English
recordingDate: 1476885121
description: 'With so many important issues on a global scale, just how important is software freedom? Software freedom is a fundamental issue, a threshold that underlies our ability to effectively solve any social problem, so we need a new way of thinking about it in relation to social justice causes. Karen Sandler shares the evolution of her own thoughts about free and open source software on a bigger political and social scale and examines the ways we should frame discourse around the issue.'
