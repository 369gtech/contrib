description: "Google Tech Talk\nDecember 9, 2009\n\nABSTRACT\n\nPresented by Dacher Keltner.  Prof. Keltner will be presenting work related to his recent book \"Born to be Good: The Science of a Meaningful Life\":\n\n\"In this talk I will survey the latest evolutionary and neuroscience that aligns with Charles Darwin's thesis that sympathy is our strongest instinct, or that we are born to be good.  I will take the audience on a tour of recent evolutionary thought, which suggests that our hyper vulnerable offspring rearranged our brains, genes, and social structures.  I will detail new research on the vagus nerve and oxytocin, branches of the nervous system that have evolved to enable cooperation, trust, and caretaking.  I detail new signaling systems -- tactile communication and vocalization -- which are critical to the transmission of prosociality across individuals.  Throughout the talk I integrate the latest science with the wisdom found in Eastern thought.\"\n\nDr. Dacher Keltner is a professor of psychology at UC Berkeley, and Director for Greater Good Science Center."
