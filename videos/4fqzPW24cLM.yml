title: 'Full-Stack Serverless with TypeScript'
language: English
recordingDate: 1617829051
description: "As we move more and more application logic to the cloud, the modern full-stack developer’s responsibilities are also changing. In addition to front-end and back-end knowledge, full-stack engineers are often also required to configure the infrastructure and services that an application depends on. While this can make engineers autonomous and extremely productive, managing a complete full-stack application across a team can quickly become cumbersome.\n\nIn this talk, we’ll explore the benefits of full-stack serverless along with strategies to manage an application across the entire stack with safety and confidence. Some technologies that we’ll use along the way include React, GraphQL, AWS CDK, and TypeScript.\n\n***\n\nZeet helps anyone deploy and scale like the top tech companies, without the work.
