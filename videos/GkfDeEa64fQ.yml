description: "The Microsoft Power Platform is an industry leading low-code development platform.  However, Power Platform is also rich with capabilities enabling greater speed and effectiveness for pro developers.  In this session, we’ll focus on the variety of Pro Developer features available in the Power Platform, and how Pro Developers can harness these capabilities to rapidly create applications. We will also discuss the unique ability of the Power Platform to support a deep synergy between Pro Developers and Citizen Developers who can more easily work together to accelerate an organization’s development efforts.  \n\nView this session on the MyBuild home page.\n\nMicrosoft Learn -- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/?WT.mc_id=build2020-ch9-niner&WT.mc_id=Build2020_presentation_additionalresources"
