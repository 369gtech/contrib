description: "PyData Tel Aviv Lightning Talks #4\n23 August 2018\nSponsored and Hosted by Barrel Protocol\nhttps://www.meetup.com/PyData-Tel-Aviv/\n\nI began a two-year contract to work on NumPy in April. In this talk I will share how it happened, what it is like to work full-time on open-source software and how it differs (or not) from working in a start-up or large firm. I will also ramble on a bit about NumPy itself, and PyPy - a python interpreter with a JIT.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nFind a PyData chapter near you: meetup.com/pro/pydata"
