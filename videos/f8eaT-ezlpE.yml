title: '"Decoding battery management data - back in the old school" - Paul Wayper (LCA 2020)'
recordingDate: 1579212956
description: "Paul Wayper\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/33/\n\nIt's great to live in an era of self-documenting APIs, easy-to-read markup, good documentation and limitless bandwidth and memory.  However, a lot of systems don't have those luxuries.  Projects as diverse as SaMBa and Nouveau have relied on decoding and inferring meaning from binary data output from closed systems with no documentation.\r\n\r\nFor my own part, I wanted to read the battery status from my electric motorbike (http://mabula.net/3faze/).  The 'normal' way to do this is via a USB connection and a Windows program, but this is inconvenient when you don't run Windows and definitely much harder to do when actually riding the motorbike!  So I wanted a way to read and record the cell voltages and overall pack status, and even link that to GPS information so I could see how fast I was going and how much power I was drawing for a ride.\r\n\r\nThis talk will include actual data, Raspberry Pis, Grafana, serial connections, Python, InfluxDB, GPS modules and Perl - not necessarily in that order.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
