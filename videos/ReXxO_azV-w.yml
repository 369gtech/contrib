description: "Asyncio in Python 3.7 and 3.8.\n[EuroPython 2018 - Talk - 2018-07-25 - Moorfoot]\n[Edinburgh, UK]\n\nBy Yury Selivanov\n\nThe talk is aimed to give attendees a clear picture of new asyncio features in Python 3.7 and give an idea of what to expect in Python 3.8.  As a CPython core developer and the lead asyncio maintainer I believe I have a unique perspective to share with EuroPython guests.\n\nPython 3.7 boasts a number of new amazing features: \n\n\nsendfile\nstart TLS\nnew high performance buffered protocols\ncontext-local state via PEP 567\nasyncio.run &amp; create_task &amp; other usability improvements\nmany performance improvements\n\n\nThe first part of the talk will be focusing on new APIs to explain them and give ideas how they can be used in production.\n\nThe second part of the talk will be focused on what to expect to see in asyncio in Python 3.8:\n\n\nnew performance tracking &amp; profiling API\nsupervisors &amp; cancel scopes\nnew timeouts API\na completely new way of writing asyncio applications\n\n\nSome of these ideas are borrowed from Trio and Curio (two other popular async/await Python frameworks), many are borrowed from languages like Erlang and Scala. One thing I can say for certain is that 3.8 will be the biggest and most interesting asyncio release ever!\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2018.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
