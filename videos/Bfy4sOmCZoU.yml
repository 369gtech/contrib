description: 'Yes, and so does your laptop, tablet and any other WiFi enabled device you own. Without even touching your device, I can tell you where have you been, and I might even tell you where are you right now in the room. I don''t even need any fancy and expensive hardware to do that. Magic? No. Scary? Yes! Well, at least it can easily be used to track you. Join me to hear a story on what I learned sniffing wireless packages, or why WiFi is broken. In this talk we will have a look at the theory behind this, how and why this works, and, of course, a live demo!'
