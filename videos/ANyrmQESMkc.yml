title: 'Intro to Probabilistic Programming and Clojure’s Anglican - Nils Blum-Oeste'
language: English
recordingDate: 1502730434
description: 'Probabilistic Programming Systems aim to merge general purpose programming with probabilistic modelling. They provide powerful statistical inference and thus allow developers to focus on the modelling with tools and environments they are comfortable with. These emerging methods are promising additions to the Data Scientist’s toolbox and an interesting, satisfying playground for programming enthusiasts. This talk is an introduction to Probabilistic Programming Systems, their use and value for the industry and Clojure’s great library “Anglican”.'
