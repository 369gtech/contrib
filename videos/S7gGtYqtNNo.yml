And yet, using many existing APIs is often an unsatisfying experience, for any number of reasons: poor documentation, confusing component interfaces, muddled abstractions, broken/missing functionality, etc.\n\nSo how can we distinguish between a good API and a bad API? More importantly, how can we make the argument to our managers that good APIs, whether obtained off-the-shelf or built in-house, are a prudent investment?\n\nThis talk seeks to discuss these questions and perhaps provide some answers. We'll look at specific criteria for evaluating the goodness and/or badness of an API. We'll cover the concepts of technical debt and software capital, and define a relationship between them and API goodness/badness. We'll also discuss a simple iterative process for building APIs which can help avoid technical debt and increase software capital. Finally, we'll cover some recommendations for doing evaluations, using the process in day-to-day work, and convincing management of your wisdom.\n— \n\nBob Steagall\nKEWB Computing\nChief Cook and Bottle Washer\nMaryland\n\nI've been working in C++ since discovering the second edition of The C++ Programming Language in a college bookstore in 1992. The majority of my career has been spent in medical imaging, where I led teams building applications for functional MRI and CT-based cardiac visualization. After a brief detour through the worlds of DNS and analytics, I'm now working in the area of distributed stream processing. I'm a voting member of the C++ Standardization Committee, and have a blog where I occasionally write about C++ and related topics. I hold BS and MS degrees in Physics, I'm an avid cyclist when weather permits, and I live in fear of my wife's cats.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
