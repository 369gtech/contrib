title: 'YOW! Connected 2017 Rob Manson - Immersive Computing & how we get there'
recordingDate: 1510707601
description: "\"Immersive\" is the key defining factor of the next wave of computing. With each computing revolution the distance between the user and the computing experience has shrunk - with today's modern mobile devices making computing Pervasive. This next step is truly user-centered and puts you right at the heart of a deeply Immersive Experience. The key question that faces us now is \"How do we get there from here?\". Our near future seems to inevitably involve hyper-connected wearable and then embed-able computer displays. But how will we all migrate from today's mobile devices to this amazing new nerdvana?\nThis session takes a detailed look at what makes \"Immersive-ness\" so important. What standards and market forces are driving this evolution. And how you can navigate your way through all the technological change this will bring.\n\nRob is the original evangelist for Mixed Reality (AR & VR) using open web standards. He's an invited expert with the W3C, the Khronos group and the ISO. He's been involved in Mixed Reality research and development for the last 12 years. Rob believes the creation of immersive experiences should be democratized and available to everyone. In 2009 he lead the team that launched the worldâ€™s first web-based AR Content Creation platform (buildAR.com).\n\nNow, Rob is the CEO & co-founder of the https://awe.media platform which gives you the power to create, view and share Mixed Reality using your web browser. It makes it easy to add 3D models, animations, event driven information and actions to your creations without any coding required. Or you can use the open source awe.js API to add your own custom functionality. All without any app store downloads, installs or updates. And that's just the start....\n\nFor more information on YOW!
