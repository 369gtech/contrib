title: 'Functional architecture - The pits of success - Mark Seemann'

description: "Object-oriented architects and developers have, over the years, learned many hard lessons about successfully designing systems with object-oriented programming. This has led to a plethora of ‘best practices’ that are painfully passed on from older to younger generations via books, lectures, consulting, blog posts, etc.\nMany of these ‘best practices’ must be explicitly taught, because they don’t evolve naturally from object-oriented programming. Surprisingly, many of these hard-won ‘best practices’ fall naturally into place when applying functional programming. Instead of deliberate design, functional programming forms pits of success where you naturally fall into the same ‘best practices’ that you have to deliberately work for in object-oriented programming. In this session, you’ll learn about a handful of such ‘best practices’, and how functional programming automatically lead you there, without your explicit effort."
