description: "Talk recording from AmsterdamJS Conference 2017, June 8 https://amsterdamjs.com\n\nJohan Gorter, Frontend Software Architect at AFAS\n\nVirtual DOM is generally considered to give the best performance for web applications. How can this be given it is such an inefficient algorithm? I will give an overview of popular Virtual DOM implementations and I will introduce our Virtual DOM library, MaquetteJS. I will also show how Virtual DOM makes unit testing easy. I will demonstrate how we achieve 100% code coverage on all our visual components using fast-running NodeJS unit tests."
