title: 'A Search Engine Architecture Based on Collection Selection'
recordingDate: 1199443111
description: "Google Tech Talks\r\nDecember, 19 2007\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nWe present a distributed architecture for a Web search engine, based\r\non the concept of collection selection. We introduce a novel approach\r\nto partition the collection of documents, able to greatly improve the\r\neffectiveness of standard collection selection techniques (CORI), and\r\na new selection function outperforming the state of the art. Our\r\ntechnique is based on the novel query-vector (QV) document model,\r\nbuilt from the analysis of query logs, and on our strategy of\r\nco-clustering queries and documents at the same time.\r\nBy suitably partitioning the documents in the collection, our system\r\nis able to select the subset of servers containing the most relevant\r\ndocuments for each query. Instead of broadcasting the query to every\r\nserver in the computing platform, only the most relevant will be\r\npolled, this way reducing the average computing cost to solve a query.\r\nWe introduce a novel strategy to use the instant load at each server\r\nto drive the query routing. Also, we describe a new approach to\r\ncaching, able to incrementally improve the quality of the stored\r\nresults. Our caching strategy is effectively both in reducing\r\ncomputing load and in improving result quality. The proposed\r\narchitecture, overall, presents a trade-off between computing cost and\r\nresult quality, and we show how to guarantee very precise results in\r\nface of a dramatic reduction to computing load. This means that, with\r\nthe same computing infrastructure, our system can serve more users,\r\nmore queries and more documents.\r\n\r\nSpeaker: Diego Puppin"
