description: "Change is inevitable, but performance is optional. How to make your application evolution resilient, while speeding up your configuration and deployment? The answer is containerization and I will detail the journey of a java app to Kubernetes cloud deployment and later templatization using Helm.\n\nNowadays many projects are packaging their releases in Docker images and regard this step as the ultimate runtime state. However, the journey of the packaged application continues by connecting it with peer containers or services. In my talk, I will provide a demonstration of how a Java application can go to Kubernetes cluster deployment, using Helm Charts as templates for interconnected containerized application. Personal observations and recommendations will conclude the experiment."
