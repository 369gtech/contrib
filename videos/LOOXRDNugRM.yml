title: 'A Practical Guide to Graph Databases - David Bechberger'
recordingDate: 1533105666
description: "With the emergence of offerings on both AWS (Neptune) and Azure (CosmosDB) within the past year it is fair to say that graph databases are of the hottest trends and that they are here to stay. So what are graph databases all about then? You can read article after article about how great they are and that they will solve all your problems better than your relational database but its difficult to really find any practical information about them.\nThis talk will start with a short primer on graph databases and the ecosystem but will then quickly transition to discussing the practical aspects of how to apply them to solve real world business problems. We will dive into what makes a good use case and what does not. We will then follow this up with some real world examples of some of the common patterns and anti-patterns of using graph databases. If you haven't been scared away by this point we will end by showing you some of the powerful insights that graph databases can provide you."
