title: '#HITBGSEC 2018 COMMSEC: Blockchain And Smart Contract Attack Vectors - Jorden Seet'
recordingDate: 1537131634
description: "The topic aims to explore known existing issues with Smart contracts and the Blockchain.\n\nThe Smart Contract examples used are issues that have occurred on the Ethereum blockchain. They are applicable to any platform that uses the Ethereum Virtual Machine and the concepts can be applied to any form of smart contracts. The topic will also cover known best practices to mitigate these issues.\n\nThe Topology attacks explore possible attack vectors on the Bitcoin network, and subsequently any networks that rely on a controlled amount of peer-peer communication for validation. The issues explored will be on two levels: Vulnerable Smart Contract codes and Topology attacks.\n\n===\n\nJorden Seet’s interest in the Cybersecurity world started in 2013 when he competed in his first CTF after a 2-day penetration testing bootcamp. Ever since, he has grown a passion in cybersecurity and explored many facets of it, from Cryptography to Social Engineering.\n\nCurrently, he is working on a National Research Foundation – Tel Aviv University (NRF-TAU) granted project on using Network Topology Analytics for Cyber Attack Deterrence in SMU. He was previously with the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore’s Penetration Testing department as an intern and is currently working with BlockConnectors on Smart Contract Audit and Blockchain development.\n\nIn his spare time, he works on Smart Contract Hacking as well as explore potential blockchain attack vectors. He firmly believes that decentralization is a paradigm that could have real potential in revolutionizing the security industry, such as in DDoS prevention, Data integrity and IoT security."
