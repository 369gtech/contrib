title: 'Using the PL/SQL Debugger - Philipp Salvisberg'
language: English
recordingDate: 1587394339
description: "Every developer knows the problem. An application doesn't do what it should and the existing logging output doesn't help. Usually, the presumed defective program area is iteratively extended by further logging calls to locate the error. If this is of no use, a colleague is called in. Maybe he has an idea. In such cases I recommend using the PL/SQL debugger. The debugger not only helps to find the error faster but is also an excellent tool to display the context of a concrete use case and to better understand the program.\n\nIn this presentation I explain among other things\n\n- the prerequisites for using the PL/SQL Debugger,\n- the difference between DBMS_DEBUG and DBMS_DEBUG_JDWP,\n- how both debugger variants can be used in SQL Developer,\n- and how debugging works directly from an application without adapting the source code.\n\n\nA recording provided by the awesome APEX community, that built a virtual 24 hour conference called APEX@Home held on April 16th 2019.\n\n\nWith 24 world renowned speakers and nearly 5000 virtual attendees, this event was a huge success.
