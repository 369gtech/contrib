description: 'You don’t have to leave your Java EE skills behind to board the microservices train. Wildfly Swarm is a lightweight approach to creating and packaging Java EE 7 applications as microservices in a single uber-JAR artifact for deployment. But Wildfly Swarm is more than just packaging: it’s also about ease of use and having many integrations out of the box and ready to go so you can concentrate on business code instead of managing dependencies and plumbing code. Attend this session to check out how Wildfly Swarm can make Java EE 7 apps awesome in Oracle Application Container Cloud.'
