description: "Spring I/O 2016 - 19 -20 May Barcelona\n\nSpring Integration extends the Spring programming model to support the well-known Enterprise Integration Patterns. Spring Integration enables lightweight messaging within Spring-based applications and supports integration with external systems via declarative adapters. Those adapters provide a higher-level of abstraction over Spring's support for remoting, messaging, and scheduling. Spring Integration's primary goal is to provide a simple model for building enterprise integration solutions while maintaining the separation of concerns that is essential for producing maintainable, testable code.\n\nThis talk will provide an overview of the framework for those new to it, while exploring some more advanced techniques for those that already have some familiarity. It will be mainly live coding using Spring Boot and RabbitMQ."
