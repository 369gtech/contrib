description: "Scaling DevOps across through Business Unit Acquisitions, Mergers, and, Spin-offs\n\nJohn Ediger, IT Strategist, DevOps Change-Agent and Evangelist, HPE\nOlivier Jacques, Distinguished Technologist R&D IT, HPE\nAshish Kuthiala, Senior Director, HPE\n\nSponsor track talk - HPE \n\nSince starting our DevOps journey at Hewlett Packard Enterprise, we have been going through several corporate reorganizations including acquisitions, mergers, and spin-offs as Hewlett-Packard Enterprise reorganizes itself to better serve our customers. \n\nIn addition to the some of the well-known challenges in adopting DevOps, corporate realignments add several complexities including splitting, reorganizing, and building new IT organizations, underlying applications, infrastructure, and charters to meet different sets of challenges. We have used the corporate reorganizations as the catalyst for the tectonic changes, doubling down on our DevOps initiatives. The company reorganizations and realignments have become the events that have driven our incentives to be more efficient, faster, leaner without sacrificing quality and we are on course thanks to the benefits of adopting DevOps. \n\nJoin our session to learn we are scaling our initial DevOps successes across our new business units, sharing the learnings, and charting new paths forward continuously improving and enabling even greater velocity for our business units to succeed.\n\nDOES16 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
