description: "The C++17 feature of Class Template Argument Deduction can help improve the readability of your code. Come see how it can be used and how well it improves the ability to read and comprehend sections of source code. Then compare it to existing features like Almost Always Auto (AAA) and C++20's concepts. And then see how and why you would create a deduction guide to extend this capability even further.\n-------\nAndrew \"A.J.\" James is a Software Engineer at TechSmith, the makers of Snagit, Camtasia and other visual communication software applications. He has been at TechSmith for the past thirteen years where he and his team help create new and exciting features as well as maintain the current products.

The 2020 conference was moved to a virtual event due to social distancing requirements.\n\nProduced and Edited by Digital Medium Ltd: https://events.digital-medium.co.uk\nEnquiries: events@digital-medium.co.uk"
