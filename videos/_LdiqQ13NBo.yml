description: "Patreon ($5/month or more gets source code for this course as it comes out): https://www.patreon.com/IAmTimCorey\n\nNewsletter signup (with exclusive discounts, giveaways, and more):  https://signup.iamtimcorey.com/\n\nIn this video, we set up a C# WebAPI project with authentication. We then walk through the settings, configure our first user, and test out the authentication and authorization process.\n\nOne-off tutorials are awesome but they aren't the only thing you should be doing to learn C#. Another vital part of learning is learning how to put it all together. This interactive course is all about putting the pieces together. You can watch each video on its own or you can watch them in order and see a bigger picture. The choice is yours.\n\nThis course focuses on real-world development. As such, we are simulating that we work for TimCo Enterprise Solutions on a brand new product, the TimCo Retail Manager. Just like in the real world, we are starting out with one set of requirements but know that over time they will change."
