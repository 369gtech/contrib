title: '[LIGHTNING TALK] Guillermo Orellana - React Native and Badoo story of a massive experiment'
recordingDate: 1536920838
description: "At Badoo we have four main mobile teams: Android, iOS, Windows Phone (yes, for real!) and Mobile Web. When Mobile Web started adopting React in their projects, it was only a matter of time for us to ask ourselves: should we try React Native? And so we did! This is a short story of our journey with React Native: discovering it, adapting it, making things work and the most important part: convincing your managers that it's worth our time!\n\nThis talk was presented at React Native EU 2017, September 6-7, Wroclaw, Poland."
