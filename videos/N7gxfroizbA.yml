description: "Filmed at https://2018.dotscale.io on June 1st in Paris. More talks on https://www.dotconferences.com/talks\n\nMust we really orchestrate our containers, or could they perhaps just do some improv jazz? The container landscape has converged on Kubernetes. Bridget talks about how, what, why, and other such excellent questions. Youâ€™ll come away with ideas for learning and sharing about k8s."
