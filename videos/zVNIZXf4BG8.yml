description: "Spring 5 is almost here! One of the most exciting introductions in this release is support for reactive programming, building on the Pivotal Reactor project to support message-driven, elastic, resilient and responsive services. Spring 5 integrates an MVC-like component model adapted to support reactive processing and a new type of web endpoint, functional reactive endpoints. In this talk, we'll look at the web runtime - which works on a net-new Netty-based runtime or existing Servlet containers - and we'll look at how existing Servlet code can run on the new world, and how to integrate it with existing Spring-stack technologies.\n\nJosh (@starbuxman) is the Spring Developer Advocate at Pivotal. Josh is a Java Champion, author of 5 books (including O'Reilly's upcoming \"Cloud Native Java: Designing Resilient Systems with Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, and Cloud Foundry\") and 3 best-selling video trainings (including \"Building Microservices with Spring Boot Livelessons\" w/ Phil Webb), and an open-source contributor (Spring Boot, Spring Integration, Spring Cloud, Activiti and Vaadin)"
