description: "https://media.ccc.de/v/ASG2019-121-squeezing-water-from-stone-kornshell-in-2019\n\n\n\nDespite of it's old age, ksh still remains one of the most popular shells. In 2013, David Korn and others who worked on ksh were laid off from AT&T Bell Labs. This lead to speculations of death of ksh. In 2017, Siteshwar Vashisht and Kurtis Rader resumed it's development on GitHub. This talk will be about what makes ksh so challenging to maintain and how new developers are trying to revive it.\n\n\n\nSiteshwar Vashisht\n\nhttps://cfp.all-systems-go.io/ASG2019/talk/CV9R3N/"
