description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM SF 19 http://bit.ly/2T3Do0U\n\nGet involved in Code Sync's next conference http://bit.ly/2Mcm4aS\n\n---\n\nOPERABLE ERLANG AND ELIXIR\nby Fred Hebert\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nDebugging\nComplexity\nResilience\n\nTALK LEVEL: Intermediate\n\nABSTRACT\nAny system that is successful necessarily grows more complex. This means that code gets messier, but also that the people who are part of the system have to handle ever-increasing complexity. It is not sufficient to take a code-centric approach; to make our Erlang and Elixir systems truly operator-friendly, we have to understand how our mental models work, and what constitutes good automation. Finally, we need to be aware of all the tools the Erlang VM makes available to us to truly deal with the unexpected.\n\nRead the full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/fred-hebert/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - FRED HEBERT\nAuthor of Erlang & Elixir books with titles too long to fit in here\n\nFred is the author of Learn You Some Erlang, Erlang in Anger, and more recently, Property-Based Testing with PropEr, Erlang, and Elixir.
