description: 'Every day we make decisions. Those decisions can be around improving your product, process, company; sometimes even bettering yourself. But many of our decisions are not made consciously. We all have biases. And even though most of our biases are unconscious, those biases still can get in a way of making the best possible decision. This is not a talk about gender and racial bias in tech hiring (altho I will also touch on hiring procedures and biases). This is a talk about different biases that skew our technical decision process that we deal with in out day-to-day operations.'
