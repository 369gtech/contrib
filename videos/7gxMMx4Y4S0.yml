description: "Thanks to our Community Sponsors: Honeycomb.io and CircleCI.com\n\nSpeakers: Jason Wong (Founder, JWong Works), Clement Ho (Frontend Engineering Manager, GitLab), Dominique Simoneau-Ritchie (Director of Engineering, Lever), Shannon Hogue-Brown (Global Head of Solutions Engineering, Karat).\n\nHiring engineers is hard. And with over half of C-suite executives saying that the future of their company relies on being able to source engineering talent, making the correct decisions about who to hire has the potential to transform the fortune of your company.\n\nThe bad news? After you’ve spent all that time sourcing candidates, ensuring your company appeals to candidates, and benchmarking your offering against similar roles? Then you’ve only got a short amount of time to assess the candidate - the interview.\n\nIn this panel we’ll take a look at: establishing your bar for hiring, processes for interviewing different candidates equitably across multiple sites, how to develop tasks and questions that let you see a candidate’s full potential, and how to sell your company to your interviewees."
