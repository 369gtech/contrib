title: 'Back to the CompletableFuture: Concurrency in Action - Dmitry Vinnik'
language: English
recordingDate: 1636365618
description: "Starting Java 8, the main focus of many developers was on Functional Programming in Java including Streams, Optional, and Functional Interfaces. However, there were more amazing features introduced along the way which has changed Java programming. One of such features was CompletableFuture which is continuously being improved in Java 9 (JEP 266). As Concurrency in Java is generally a complicated topic where many had a difficult time switching to ThreadLocal from regular Threads, the idea of Future and CompletableFuture which refers to asynchronous computations is even more difficult. In this talk, the speaker will attempt to make asynchronous programming using Java 8/9 more compelling by approaching the topic with clear examples and references to other languages. One example of a language heavily relying on asynchronous tasks is JavaScript. Using some of the conceptual similarities of two languages in regards to asynchronous programming, this talk will cover how Future/CompletableFuture can be used in a safe and a programmer friendly way.\n\nPresented by Dmitry Vinnik\n\nSubscribe to our channel: https://youtube.pl/c/DevoxxPoland?sub_confirmation=1\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DevoxxPL\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/grzegorz.duda.official/\n\nJoin us also here:\nTechnology Radar Review: https://dworld.pl/radar\nDevelopers World Academy: https://dworld.pl/akademia\nDevflix: https://devflix.pl\n\n#Devoxx #DevoxxPoland #IT #Development #SoftwareDevelopment"
