description: "DOES18 Las Vegas â€” Even with standardized tool sets and requirements for packaging and deployment, individual project needs can vary greatly in any organization. A web service repo and a mobile app repo will have different workflow experiences regardless of the standardization brought forth from an authoritative source. Another challenge is that only a subset of people who use defined workflows have agency to improve upon them or bring knowledge in from outside the local ecosystem. Learn how to make workflow innovation more accessible so that anyone can build tailored workflows leveraging GitHub and other APIs, closer to the code and open sourced inside of your organization.\n\nBuilding, Sharing, and Customizing Workflows with GitHub\n\nGreg Padak, Global Solutions and Product Engineer, GitHub\n\nGreg sits in between the Sales, Support, Marketing, and Product organizations and oversees their customer feedback program.
