recordingDate: 1564391762
description: "Video from Devoxx Poland 2019.\n\nSince several years, the world of JVM GC evolved. A new kind of GC emerges: low latency GCs. Shenandoah is provided by Red Hat, Oracle open sourced ZGC in OpenJDK since JDK 11 and Azul C4 is sill there.â€‹\n\nAs \"classical\" GCs are well understood, this talk will focus on internals of the most recent ones. We will explain Concurrent Marking (tri-color marking), the C4's Load Value Barrier, Shenandoah's Brooks Pointers and ZGC's multi-mapping. Finally, how to choose a low latency GC?"
