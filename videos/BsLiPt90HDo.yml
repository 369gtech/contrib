title: 'Teaching Clojure at IBM - Steve Shogren'
recordingDate: 1447792754
description: "We had a month till the industry conference. It had to run on JVM. We are a .NET shop. We tallied the team's skills other than C#: Ruby, Java, Python, PHP, Scala, Perl, and Clojure. Not a single overlapping language between us.\n\n\"Who would feel comfortable having to train everyone else?\"\n\nI put myself forward for Clojure. A month later we shipped.\n\nHere's the report of how I became confident enough to suggest Clojure as an option and then train the rest of the team. I'll cover the skills and attitudes that I believe made the project a success. I'll also make suggestions for what can reduce the friction of introducing Clojure at your company.\n\nAbout the speaker: I am a software engineer, writer, and dev manager. I co-organize Clojadelphia, the Philadelphia Clojure meetup. I author the development blog Deliberate Software, where I write about Clojure, F#, and skills for new developers.\n\nI have a passion for training and learning. I previously worked as a middle school teacher, then later as a developer trainer. I've found Clojure to be the tool that gives me the longest lever between my skill and the problem, so it is the tool I grab for first. Therefore, most of my teaching these days is around Clojure."
