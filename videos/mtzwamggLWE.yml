description: "Presentation from the 'Agile Riga Day 2012' conferenece.\r\n\r\nEarly in 2010 we implemented Scrum in Adform as its development process. More than 40 people were split to 6 cross functional teams. So what's the big deal you will ask? The big deal for us was: we all work developing ONE product (SaS Ads Serving platform)! We are not working on separate projects!\r\n\r\nHow to organize Product Management work to fit this? How 6 Product Owners should work together, with company management, and other departments? How to split big features and divide work to teams (usually one feature had to be implemented by few teams to bring value to the customer)? What to do with \"research\" projects? How to handle the growth of the company (now we have more than 50 people and 8 teams)?\r\n\r\nIn this presentation I will share our journey, as well as mistakes we made and lessons learned. If you are implementing Agile in organization or project with many teams working on one product - this presentation is for you.\r\n\r\nWebsite: http://www.agilerigaday.lv/Sessions/product-management-in-agile-organization-with-product-developed-by-many-teams"
