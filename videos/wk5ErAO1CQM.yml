title: 'Webinar: How to migrate NF or VNF to CNF without vendor lock-in'
language: English
recordingDate: 1603223292
description: "We believe in the open ecosystem in the telco world. CSPs should learn from the open-source community-driven approach, apply Carrier Grade requirements, and force SLA and go brave.\n\nIn this webinar, we want to show how to achieve significant cost reduction using open source projects like ONF EPC, CNCF, or other open-source projects to migrate from legacy Network Function or vendor-specific VNFs to cost-effective, flexible, and future proof CNFs. We want to show you how to tame the legacy protocols like SIP, DIAMETER, SMPP, and prepare for 5G RESTFul API.\n\nPresenters:\nGrzegorz Sikora, VP Business Development @OVOO\nRafał Myśliwiec, Software Engineer @OVOO\nPaweł Kulpa, Software Engineer @OVOO"
