Add WebRTC on top of that and we'll see interesting collaborative applications that play out in three-dimensional space right from within our browsers. Paraphrasing the movie Tron: “But then, we got in”. WebVR allows us to hook up the browser to a new universe of VR hardware and immersive experiences.\n\nLet's explore what we can do together by combining the technologies to create a universe that we can explore together and what is yet uncharted land that we can discover."
