description: "Marek Kopicki (Intelligent Robotics) - Challenges in autonomous robotic manipulation\nThe speech was given on 2016-05-19 at infoShare 2016 (Startup Stage) in Gdańsk. http://infoshare.pl\n\nMarek Kopicki - Researcher in Intelligent Robotics at the University of Birmingham. I have a number of refereed publications on robot manipulation in top robotics journals (IJRR) and conferences (IROS, ICRA). I am a PI on the RoMaNs H2020 project, and CoI on two national projects in the UK, with career funding exceeding €1m. I am a WP leader in the PacMan FP7 project where I lead integration efforts across the project. I have invented an adaptive grasping algorithm, for which I hold an international patent pending. I am the author of the Golem and Grasp robotic frameworks which together with the grasping algorithm control the Boris robot, which has been covered in the media worldwide including the BBC, the Times newspaper, the Guardian, the Daily Mail, radio New Zealand and many more.\n\nFollow infoShare:\nhttps://facebook.com/infosharepl\nhttps://twitter.com/infosharepl\nhttps://www.instagram.com/infoshare/\nhttps://plus.google.com/+infoshare/"
