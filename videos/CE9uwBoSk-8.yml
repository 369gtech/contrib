Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nDr etcd; or; How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Datastore - Nick Young, VMware \n\nIf you’ve deployed your own Kubernetes cluster, care and feeding of an etcd cluster is a necessary evil. At the end of the day, etcd is the place where your cluster’s buck stops, and despite the marketing hype, operating an etcd cluster at scale is not a set and forget experience.\n\nThis talk tells a story of how my team grew from etcd novices to delivering a well-monitored, reasonably resilient, etcd system that could be upgraded in less than half an hour per cluster, online, with no downtime.\n\nAfter this talk, you will have:\n- a better understanding of etcd's sharp edges, and what you can do to avoid catching yourself on them\n- some insights on key etcd metrics to keep an eye on and why\n- what we tried with upgrades, what worked, and what didn't, and how you can avoid stepping in our potholes\n- some war stories, like when we accidentally made 80k namespaces in Kube and filled our etcd."
