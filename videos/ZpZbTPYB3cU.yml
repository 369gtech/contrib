description: "Voicemail systems have been with us since the 80s. They played a big role in the earlier hacking scene and re-reading those e-zines, articles and tutorials paints an interesting picture. Not much has changed. Not in the technology nor in the attack vectors. Can we leverage the last 30 years innovations to further compromise voicemail systems? And what is the real impact today of pwning these? \n\nIn this talk I will cover voicemail systems, it's security and how we can use oldskool techniques and new ones on top of current technology to compromise them. I will discuss the broader impact of gaining unauthorized access to voicemail systems today and introduce a new tool that automates the process."
