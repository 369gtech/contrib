title: 'Agile Tour Kaunas 2012: Audrys Ka≈æukauskas. Introduction into Extreme Programming'
recordingDate: 1350138617
description: "Introduction into Extreme Programming\nExtreme Programming might not be a silver bullet, but in software development it is almost that. Managers get all the bells and whistles you would expect from an agile process, whilst developers are equipped with a set of principles and practices, which almost inevitably improve the codebase and enable frequent delivery of quality software. In fact, many teams, which use other software development processes (Scrum, for instance) eventually end up adopting quite a few XP practices. I'll give you an introduction into XP, share my experiences and provide references to XP material for learning more about XP."
