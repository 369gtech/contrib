description: "http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2017/michal-plachta\n\nYou will learn how simple functional patterns can be used to make your business logic cleaner and more testable.\n\nAsynchronous programming brings a lot of Futures to your code. Bad news is that they are not essential to what your application really does… You end up with Futures of assertions in your unit tests or, even worse, with Await or expectNoMsg calls.\n\nThis is a live coding talk. First I will code an application using Futures in both business logic and unit tests. Then I will get rid of Futures without losing asynchronicity. In the second part, I will do a step by step refactoring of a simple Akka actor system. In both cases I will use typeclasses from Cats library."
