description: "Declarative configuration management in Kubernetes is powerful, but can also be a pain when you as a cluster administrator need to enforce best practice compliance across resources. Similarly, Kubernetesâ€™ RBAC capabilities are powerful, but cannot be easily tweaked based on namespaces, labels, or other settings.\n\nKyverno is a Kubernetes policy engine that was designed to solve these problems, and much more, in an intuitive manner and Kubernetes-native manner. Join us to learn how to easily mutate, validate, and generate configurations to keep your clusters safe and healthy!\n\nPresenter:\n\nShuting Zhao, Software Engineer @Nirmata\nJim Bugwadia, Founder and CEO @Nirmata"
