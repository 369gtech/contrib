description: "Thanks to the wide adoption and availability of WebGL across browsers (including those on mobile) we get control of the full graphics pipeline.\n\nAfter we get an introduction to WebGL basics and the render pipeline, we'll learn what Three.js brings to the table and do a live coding demonstration you can code along to in which weâ€™ll build a 3D web app from the ground up with all elements."
