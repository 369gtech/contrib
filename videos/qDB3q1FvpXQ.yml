recordingDate: 1533125326
description: "Bots are cool! They are fun to write, and when done correctly can have a significant boost to productivity. At Pushpay we rely heavily on bots to aid with our continuous delivery, and the result has been an overall increase in productivity even during the periods where delivery traditionally slows down.\nI will take you on a tour of the bots that we have created at Pushpay, and show how they've evolved over time. I will discuss some of the mistakes we've made along the way, along with our successes. I will show how to get started should you wish to create one yourself."
