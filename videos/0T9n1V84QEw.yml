title: 'A JDBC Datasource for Failing Over and Replaying In-Flight Transactions'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433784726
description: "Application continuity in the face of planned and unplanned database outages is a business requirement. Upon a database outage, Java applications are confronted with four main issues: hang, errors, outcome of in-flight work, and resubmission of in-flight work. This session presents a new JDBC  datasource that transparently captures database interactions and then, upon database instance failure, fails over connections and replays in-flight transactions. Just plain standard JDBC, no proprietary API. In most cases, the replay datasource can transparently fail over in-flight transactions. The presentation also discusses design considerations, configurations, and restrictions.\n\n\nAuthors:\nKuassi Mensah\nundefined\nView more trainings by Kuassi Mensah at https://www.parleys.com/author/kuassi-mensah-1\n\nDouglas Surber\nDouglas is Consulting Member of Technical Staff within Oracle Server Technologies Division.
