description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nDeliver Your Cloud Native Application with Design Pattern as Code - Jun Makishi & Rintaro Sekino, NTT Communications \n\nAs Cloud Native landscape is evolving, and many practices become outdated quickly, it is hard to follow best practices for integrating Cloud Native tools. NTT Communications has introduced a new idea to manage such integration: Design Pattern as Code. We break a Cloud Native architecture into a small portion of design pattern per context to make it reusable and composable. As this approach enables sharing a well designed and maintained integration pattern across organizations, our software delivery becomes safe and scalable. We will throw a live demo to build an application from some practical design patterns to turn it to Cloud Native application and delivery it to production safely. We leverage Tekton, Cuelang, and many other Open Source tools, and we will give all participants our insight to use those tools to achieve such scalable application delivery\n\nhttps://sched.co/ZeiY"
