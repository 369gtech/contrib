title: 'Integrating high speed fabrics into the Linux network stack'
recordingDate: 1485403572
description: "Christoph Lameter\nhttp://linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/68/\nThe interface to High Performance network fabrics such as Infiniband and Omnipath has traditionally been like a side car in the kernel. Software was developed in a separate section from the kernel netowrk stack. This talk is about how to integrate the fabrics properly into the network stack so that standard things like ethtool or netstat and the commonly availabe /proc/net/... things will work. This is work on progress so at this early point is it not clear how far the work will have progressed until the presentation."
