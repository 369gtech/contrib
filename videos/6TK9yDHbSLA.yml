description: "The cloud, everyone is talking about it. Most of the cloud providers give you a very capable platform to build your applications on. But what can you do if your cloud provider only gets you 90% of the way for your platform? You could just leave the missing pieces to the different teams in your organisation. That just requires every team to have an expert in how your chosen cloud platform works. Not only are those individuals hard to find, you also end up implementing things multiple times.\n\nThe answer? Pull the cloud experts together and have them deliver a platform on top of the chosen cloud platform. A platform that makes it easy for your application developers to get the 100% without having to resort to deep knowledge about the cloud platform you are using.\n\nThis is what we have done at Alert Logic. We call it EEE.\n\nThis talk will go through the architecture of EEE and show how it provides a version of AWS Lambda that covers all our needs.\n\nMore details here: https://codesync.global/speaker/torben-hoffmann/"
