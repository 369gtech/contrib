title: 'Event-driven serverless architectures using Knative and Cloud Run - Mete Atamel - NDC Sydney 2020'
language: English
recordingDate: 1630507219
description: "When you combine the efficiency of containers, agility of serverless and flexibility of event-driven services, you end up with a more reusable, interoperable and scalable architecture with minimal management overhead.\n\nIn this talk, we’ll explore the open-source Knative Eventing and its managed version Cloud Run. We’ll explore what they provide for event-driven serverless containers and we’ll deep dive into some real-world reference architectures.\n\nAt the end of this session, you’ll have a solid understanding on how Knative and Cloud Run can power your event-driven apps."
