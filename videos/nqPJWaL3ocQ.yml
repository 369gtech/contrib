A new and upcoming Function as a Service offering, created and developed by Pivotal, and completely open source. It builds on Kubernetes, Zookeeper and Kafka and provides an easy way to write functions, in any language, and execute, auto-scale and chain functions together. One of the elegant and most beautiful example of a function is the Mandelbrot fractal, which can generate stunning images with incredible detail. This quickie consists of an introduction of Riff in combination with Spring Cloud Function and ends with a cool demo of infinite detail.\n\nDieter Hubau \nFrom Ordina Belgium\nDieter is a Principal Consultant at Ordina Belgium.\n\nHe has about 11 years of consulting experience and is Practice Manager Cloud Automation.\n\nDuring his career, he has worked in very different environments, ranging from the banking, distribution and government industry to the world of telecommunications, healthcare and big pharma.\n\nWhen he started his career developing monolith applications running on obsolete application servers, he never could have dreamed how dramatically the world of software would change. Currently, he's working on the digital transformation of companies with a DevOps mindset, moving towards a microservice architecture and deploying cloud-native applications to Kubernetes based offerings on AWS, Azure or GCP."
