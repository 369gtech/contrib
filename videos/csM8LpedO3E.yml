description: "Lightning Talk: Kubegres: Accessing K8s From Postgres - Liz Frost, Heptio \n\nPostgres is a very versatile database. In addition to regular SQL queries, you can use a Foreign Data Wrapper to make anything - other databases, JSON files, Twitter - appear to be just another set of tables in the database. This includes Kubernetes! In this lighting talk I will show off querying cluster information, starting and stopping pods, and more… all from inside a postgres SQL prompt. Along the way, I’ll explain a bin about the Postgres foreign data wrapper model, how to use the Go client for Kubernetes, and show off some fun statistics you can gather when your whole cluster is a database. \n\nTo Learn More:  https://sched.co/GrVY"
