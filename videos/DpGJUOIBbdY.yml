description: 'I will present two case studies of groups using biohacking methods to create generic versions of two of the most widely prescribed and most expensive pharmaceuticals in America. I will explain their methods and motivations in the context of the crisis of distributive justice in the US healthcare system. I question the ethics of the the delivery of pharmaceuticals to patients in the US and argue that biohackers are actually acting in a way that is morally acceptable, given the circumstances.'
