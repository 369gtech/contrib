description: "Erlang User Conference 2012\n\nerlang-solutions.com\nerlang-factory.com\n\n\"Despite Moore's ``law'', uniprocessor clock speeds have now stalled. Rather than using single processors running at ever higher clock speeds, it is  common to find dual-, quad- or even hexa-core processors, even in consumer laptops and desktops. Future hardware will not be slightly parallel, however, as in today's multicore systems, but will be massively parallel, with manycore and perhaps even megacore systems becoming mainstream. This means that programmers need to start thinking parallel from the outset of  their program development rather than treating parallelism as a bolt-on afterthought. This talk introduces the Paraphrase approach to constructing parallel programs, a new approach that uses formally-defined refactoring transformations based around strong parallel patterns and associated skeleton implementations, and directly exploits functional programming concepts. We show how complex parallel programs can be built from primitive Erlang building blocks, and describe some new software refactorings for parallel Erlang programs that capture common parallel abstractions, such as divide-and-conquer and data parallelism, using these building blocks. The ParaPhrase approach is both flexible and scalable, capable of covering both GPU and CPU computations, scaling from multi-core to mega-core processors, and covering a variety of parallel programming paradigms. \"\n\nFollow us on Twitter @Erlangfactory twitter.com/#!/erlangfactory\nJoin our group on Linkedin Erlang Factory linkedin.com/groups/Erlang-Factory-2003110?trk=myg_ugrp_ovr"
