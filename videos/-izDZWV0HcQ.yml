description: "Despite all the advice that's given to us, we seem intent on ignoring it. For better or worse, we rarely follow it until years later we understand what the person was trying to tell us. In this talk, I'll share the helpful, humiliating, and hilarious pieces of advice I've received and how they shaped my career (whether I listened or not). We'll also discuss why giving and receiving advice is important, how to handle it gracefully and why it can be so powerful. As Dijkstra said: \"We must be very careful when we give advice to younger people: sometimes they follow it!\"\n\nSlide: http://www.slideshare.net/Codemotion/old-codemotion"
