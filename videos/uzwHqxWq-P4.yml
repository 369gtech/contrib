language: English
recordingDate: 1619697884
description: "\"We will discuss the challenges, the traps, and all that you need to know to deploy a Kubernetes application in multi-cloud. We will also demonstrate in real-time the advantages of multi-cloud, such as cost optimization across clouds, the resiliency of the application to a cloud failure, and vertical and horizontal autoscaling using effective cost/performance compute resources.\n\nDemo! During the session, we will deploy an eCommerce application within minutes on a cluster that spans AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.\""
