description: "Tim McNamara\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/89/\n\nRust is often described as having a difficult learning curve. Let’s find a hidden escalator. By the end of this tutorial, you’ll find building a command-line utility in Rust to be about as easy as one that’s written in Python or Ruby, and you’ll be able to distribute it as a stand alone binary.\r\n\r\nMany of the difficulties learning Rust emerge from two sources: jargon and novel concepts. Avoiding the jargon keeps some the cognitive capacity in reserve to focus on the new concepts. Much of jargon has its roots in Rust’s functional programming heritage and early-adoption by programming language theorists. It’s possible to bypass much of that and focus on getting something working first. There’s plenty of time to learn about affine type systems and \r\nmonomorphisation once you’ve got a working project or two.\r\n\r\nThis practical tutorial will take you through the process of writing a command-line from scratch. We’ll learn all about the essentials of the language, as well as the tooling that’s available for people who may not have worked with a compiled language before. We’ll also spend some time talking about how  to access further help when you’re working on your own.\r\n\r\nAt this stage of its life cycle, everyone who knows Rust learned something else first. That means that there are plenty of people in your position who have been able to push through and make progress.\r\n\r\nCome and learn Rust!\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
