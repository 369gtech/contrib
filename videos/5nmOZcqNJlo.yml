description: "Thom Leggett\nDirector, Oracle Cloud product development.\nOracle\n\nMatthew Gilliard\nPrincipal Software Engineer - Container Development\nOracle\n\nDevelopers just want to write and deploy their code. This sounds easy enough but typically before you can deploy you need to allocate the necessary infrastructure including provisioning machines, configuring storage, configuring networking, and so on—all just to run even one line of code! Fortunately, serverless function platforms that eliminate infrastructure concerns entirely are appearing, although the majority of those platforms are proprietary. To avoid this vendor lock-in the open source Fn Project (fnproject.io) was recently launched."
