description: "An introduction to statistics and probability geared toward enabling attendees to understand the capabilities and limitations of statistics and probability and to help them implement calculations in their projects. Where possible/feasible, attendees will build their own tools to help them grasp the underlying concepts. In addition, attendees will be introduced to the pre-built tools in world-class Python and data science libraries to help them capitalize on the efficiencies and utility that those libraries offer.\n\nTalk given by Chalmer Lowe at PyCon 2018.\n\nThanks to PyCon for giving us permission to post this talk. freeCodeCamp is not associated with this talk.
