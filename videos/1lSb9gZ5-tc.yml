For the past 2 years we are constantly improving our solution but we came to the point where architecture became a limitation... so we decided to do a rewrite and use the latest Vue features. As one of the first big projects in the world on Vue 3 we had a chance to explore and adapt new amazing patterns brought by Composition API. During this talk you will learn how using new Vue 3 features can bring developer experience to a completely new level!\n\nVuejs Amsterdam 20th, 21st Feb 2020\n游비2494 Attendees over 2 Days\n游비Flying in from 50+ Countries\n游비16 Talks from JS Leaders\n游비20+ Sponsors\n\nLargest Vue Conference and Community Event in the World 游깴\n\nSign up and be first to get notified about Vuejs Amsterdam 2021 \nhttps://confirmsubscription.com/h/t/DD88027477DDD5A4\n\nFollow us on Social\nLinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/company/27123036\nTwitter https://twitter.com/vuejsamsterdam?s=20\nFacebook https://www.facebook.com/vuejsamsterdam/\nInstagram https://www.instagram.com/vuejsamsterdam/\n\nPowered by Passionate People\n\nWant to join their quest to be the lead Vue Consultancy on the planet? ;)\n\nhttps://passionatepeople.io/careers\n\nFollow on Social \nLinkedIn  https://www.linkedin.com/company/passionatepeoplefrontend\nTwitter https://twitter.com/passionpeopleNL?s=20\n\n#frontendlove #frontenddeveloperlove #vuejsamsterdam #vueamsterdam"
