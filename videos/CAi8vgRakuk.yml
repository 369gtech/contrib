description: "PyData DC 2018\n\nEfficient array computing is required to continue advances in fields like IoT and AI. We demonstrate a system, uarray, that does array computation generically and targets different backends. We rely on a Mathematics of Arrays, a theory of shapes and indexing, to reduce array expressions. As a result, temporary arrays and unneeded calculations are eliminated leading to minimal memory and CPU usage.\n\nNotebook -  https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/uarray/blob/master/notebooks/2018.11.20%20PyData%20Presentation.ipynb\n===\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
