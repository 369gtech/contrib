description: "Serverless is the most clickbaity title for an actually interesting thing. Despite the name, serverless does not mean you’re not using a server, rather, the promise of serverless is to no longer have to babysit a server. Scaling is done for you, you’re billed only for what you use. In this session, Sarah will cover some key use cases for these functions within a Vue.js application: she’ll accept payments with stripe, gather geolocation data from Google Maps, and more! She’ll make it all work with Vue and Nuxt seamlessly, simplifying how to leverage this paradigm to be a workhorse for your application.\n\nEVENT:\n\nfitcevents 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nSarah Dranser\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nConference Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish fitcevents videos.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gpgrg-sXR3w\n\nSave 10% off any FITC event with discount code 'youtube'.
