description: "Testing Aesthetics: The influence of design aesthetics in usability with Mariesa Dale Everyone knows that usability testing of the websites and apps we produce is important. But what about testing aesthetics? How a product looks and feels to the user has considerable influence over purchasing and implementation decisions. Regrettably, this aspect of product desirability can often be overlooked in terms of a product’s success or failure. Whether a user likes a design is not the only criterion by which to judge a product - the ultimate goal is a design that positively reflects the company it represents while simultaneously appealing and communicating effectively to the user demographic. This Tech Talk will focus on techniques to create and maintain that balance for your users.\n\nSpeaker: Mariesa Dale, Pivotal Labs"
