description: "An ending is an opportunity for a new beginning. As we bring SC2017 to a close, you’ll have picked up new tools and techniques that you’re keen to try out and connections you want to explore.\n\nHow will you get value from our time together and share that value with others?\n\nIn her closing keynote, Rachel will inspire you to pause, evaluate, and begin afresh.\n\n// This talk was given by Rachel Davies at SC London 2017, a conference dedicated to Craftsmanship values, XP practices & clean code.
