description: "Washing away code smells\n[EuroPython 2018 - Talk - 2018-07-25 - Kilsyth]\n[Edinburgh, UK]\n\nBy Yenny Cheung\n\nDoes your code smell? Have a weird fragrance? It turns out code smells are a real thing and an amazing conceptualization of suboptimal design. This talk helps you identify code smells in Python. It also shows you how to wash them away by the technique of refactoring. You will learn the art of writing Pythonic, clean and maintainable code.\n\nCode smells refer to the symptoms of problematic code design. Identifying different types of code smells is the first step to successful refactoring. I will talk through some classic examples:\n\n\nUnnecessary long and complex code\nUsing mutable data structures\nUncommunicative naming\nCoupled code\n\n\nKnowing what to refactor, I will share a few learnings that lead to good quality code:\n\n\nThe boy scout rule: always leave the code cleaner than you found it\nPythonic data structures: Enum, Namedtuple\nThe art of naming\nDRY and the separation of concerns principle\n\n\nI will also share tips on using refactoring at your company, which includes convincing your product manager, looking out for code smells during code reviews, and employing automatic tools.\n\nThe speaker has previously presented on Talk Python To Me Podcast: https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/150/technical-lessons-learned-from-pythonic-refactoring, and at PyCon.DE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq9-b2JKUyU.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2018.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
