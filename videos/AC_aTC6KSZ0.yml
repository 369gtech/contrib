description: "Manual testing in Agile development, especially a Scrum environment presents challenges in the form of time constraints and ensuring a balance between in-Sprint work testing and wider regression testing while ensuring the quality of the software produced.\n\nWorking through black vs white box testing, test analysis, types of testing, test management, and reporting as implemented by our teams, this talk aims to improve the knowledge of new testers, developers, and testers looking to work in an Agile/Scrum environment and show the benefits of using Exploratory Testing to improve test coverage and confidence in the quality of software produced."
