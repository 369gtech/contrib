description: "In this session Srikrishnan Suresh demonstrates how the SODA Api can be used with NodeJs, Express and React to build modern web applications. Jeff Smith explains how ORDS (Oracle Rest Data Services) can be used to simplify REST-based development.\nSERN stack SODA, Express, React, NodeJS using Oracle Database\n\nThe video gives an introduction to the SERN stack for JSON-based application development using React, NodeJS, JavaScript, Express and the SODA Api (the JSON document-store api of Oracle's database).\nSrikrishnan Suresh will walk us through a simple demo that is also available on Github (https://github.com/oracle/json-in-db/tree/master/MuSprint).\nJeff Smith explains how ORDS (Oracle REST Data Services) can simplify REST based development.\n\nTimeline past intro:\n0:00 - 1:50\n1:51 - 3:39   What is the SERN stack?\n3:40 - 8:04   SODA: (Simple Oracle Document Access) Api\n8:05 - 10:45  SODA in context of SERN stack\n10:46 - 10:25 Express\n10:26 - 15:30 React \n15:31 - 18:12 SERN Interaction Overview\n18:13 - 19:10 Model -View Paradigm\n19:11 - 20:29 Intro: MuSprint Application built with SERN stack\n20:30 - 23:19 Development Process (Teamwork)\n23:20 - 26:33 Web Interface, JSX\n26:34 - 27:20 Event Handler\n27:21 - 34:55 SODA backed Rest Services \n34:56 - 48:20 Github project, code walk-through\n48:21 - 56:50 ORDS: Oracle Rest Data Services  \n56:51 - END\n\nhttps://developer.oracle.com/"
