description: "Adding a New Storage Provider to Rook - Jared Watts, Upbound \n\nThe CNCF hosted Rook project has built a framework for running stateful workloads on Kubernetes, enabling storage providers to seamlessly and effectively integrate into cloud native environments. This framework is already being used to support multiple storage providers such as Ceph, CockroachDB, Minio and NFS. In this talk, Jared will walk through how new storage providers can also take advantage of this framework to easily and reliably run on Kubernetes. He will also cover the benefits that Rook provides to make this transition to cloud native environments easier for new storage providers. Finally, the important architecture, design, and concepts for running storage solutions on Kubernetes will be explored in detail. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/Grb1"
