description: "Andrew Hanushevsy, Garrick Evans, Sergey Panitkin \n\nIn this talk we will describe the ATLAS Experiment on Google Compute Engine (GCE) scientific computing project and illustrate several examples of large-scale high performance computing installations on GCE, including a 1000-core PROOF cluster for ATLAS data analysis and a 4000-core HTCondor cluster used for simulation of LHC collision events. We will also discuss Xroot technology used for high-performance data clustering.\n\nFor all I/O 2013 sessions, go to https://developers.google.com/live"
