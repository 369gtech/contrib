description: "Erlang User Conference 2012\n\nerlang-solutions.com\nerlang-factory.com\n\n\"DETS, used by Mnesia for permanent storage has, some well known shortcomings (e.g. max 2 GB tables, slow repair of big tables and no ordered set semantics).\n\nKlarna and ESL have been looking at other backend solutions. An earlier work made an experimental plugin framework in Mnesia and a filesystem-based plugin. This talk describes a continuation of the earlier work.\n\nIn this work the backend plugin framework has been refined and documented. The plugin developed is based upon LevelDB by Google and the eleveldb API made by Basho. It's also possible to design your own plugins based on other Key/Value storage backends.\"\n\nFollow us on Twitter @Erlangfactory twitter.com/#!/erlangfactory\nJoin our group on Linkedin Erlang Factory linkedin.com/groups/Erlang-Factory-2003110?trk=myg_ugrp_ovr"
