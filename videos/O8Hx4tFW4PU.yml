description: "Creating relationships with the individual humans on your distributed team is difficult since you rarely get to see them in person! But a team is much less likely to be effective and successful without a foundation of interpersonal relationships and trust. How do you build those when you live zip codes, time zones, countries apart?\n\n1:1 meetings - these are the backbone of a successful team. The constraints present in remote 1:1s can be frustrating, but the right approach can result in some great 1:1 habits.\n\nThis talk will give you the tools you need to craft effective 1:1s for your distributed team. You’ll learn some ground rules for remote 1:1s, which details are important to get right and which ones aren’t worth sweating about. We’ll discuss what to talk about during your 1:1s and how to use these meetings to build more trusting and productive relationships with your team. \n\nDone right, 1:1s will be your most important meetings of the week.\n\nAbout Spencer Norman\nSpencer is the Director of Engineering at Reaction Commerce, a distributed-first company building open source commerce software.
