title: 'Webinar: S&P experience report: multi-cloud serverless on K-native'
language: English
recordingDate: 1602794779
description: "Knative promises to “abstract away the complex details (of Kubernetes) and enable developers to focus on what matters”. While Kubernetes has redefined the base level infrastructure expectations at many organizations, developers often struggle to understand and leverage the features available to them. Mark Wang and Evan Anderson will explain how S&P has used Knative to build a serverless developer experience. Along the way, you’ll learn about how Knative leverages Kubernetes to build a serverless platform on cloud-independent infrastructure.\n\nPresenters:\nEvan Anderson, Software Engineer @VMware\nMark Wang, Head of Cloud Engineering @S&P Global Ratings"
