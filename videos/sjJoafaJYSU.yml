This talk will show, how to configure Fluentd to receive logs messages via syslog. Furthermore, parsing the log messages will be explained with special attention on the structured metadata from CloudFoundry and parsing of the access logs generated by the gorouter. This results in a basic configuration, that can be enriched by custom parsing rules for the log messages."
