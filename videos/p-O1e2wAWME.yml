title: 'How to Use the new JDBC 4.3 Sharding API for Massive OLTP Scaling'
language: English
recordingDate: 1540589878
description: "Doug Hood, Cloud Product Manager, Oracle\n\nThe key to linear scaling for OLTP workloads is data-dependent routing. JDK9 introduced the sharding API for JDBC 4.3 to enable data-dependent routing. In this session, see how to use this new JDBC API for massive OLTP scaling with the YCSB and SwingBench benchmarks and how to configure and code both the Oracle Sharding feature of Oracle Database and the Oracle TimesTen Scaleout feature of Oracle TimesTen In-Memory Database to use data-dependent routing for massive scalability. Examples include sharding keys, ConnectionBuilders, and data sources."
