description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2020 by Garima Jain, Over.\n\nMore info: https://android-makers-2020.firebaseapp.com/schedule/?sessionId=168437\n\nMigrating an Rx MVI pattern completely to coroutines using Flow.\r\n\r\nIn the MVI world, there was a missing piece from the coroutines framework and due to this, it always felt strange to completely adopt coroutines. Recently, with the introduction of Co-routines Flow library, things are not so strange anymore.\r\nIn this talk we will have a look at Coroutines Flow library, its need and how it compares with the reactive world. We will then learn to migrate an Rx MVI pattern to use coroutines Flow."
