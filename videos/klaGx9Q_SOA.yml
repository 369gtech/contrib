recordingDate: 1526237529
description: "Speaker: Trey Hunner\n\nThe end of life for Python 2 is 2020. Python 3 is the future and you'll need to consider both your upgrade plan and what steps you'll take after upgrading to start leveraging Python 3 features.\n\nDuring this talk we'll briefly discuss how to start **the process of upgrading your code to Python 3**. We'll then dive into some of **the most useful Python 3 features** that you'll be able to start embracing once you drop Python 2 support.\n\nA number of the most powerful Python 3 features are syntactic features that are **Python 3 only**. You won't get any experience using these features until you fully upgrade. These features are an incentive to drop Python 2 support in existing 2 and 3 compatible code. You can consider this talk as a teaser of Python 3 features that you may have never used.\n\nAfter this talk I hope you'll be inspired to fully upgrade your code to Python 3.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2018 and https://github.com/PyCon/2018-slides"
