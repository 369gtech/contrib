description: "Google Tech Talk\nMarch 22, 2013\n(more info below)\nPresented by Caitlin Malone (CERN), Jens Dopke (CERN)\n\nABSTRACT\n\nLast week at the Moriond physics conferences, the ATLAS and CMS experiments at CERN confirmed that the particle they discovered last year is, in fact, a Higgs boson.  If it walked like a duck and quacked like a duck in July 2012, why did it take until March 2013 to confirm that it is a duck?  And why, for that matter, was a duck theorized in 1963 only discovered last year?  Here's the story of the Higgs boson discovery, from inside the Higgs working groups, as experienced by the CERN foot soldiers (read: grad students and postdocs).  As a generous bonus, we'll throw in some wild and irresponsible speculation about what might be next from CERN..."
