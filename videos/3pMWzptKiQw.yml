description: "Communicating while working remotely is difficult: talking to coworkers via chat systems or video conferences hides many of the nuances of in-person communication. Jessica Hilt describes how to use \"strategic storytelling\" when communicating to help add more information.  While her description is not specific to working remotely, the same techniques can help fill in details that make remote communication difficult.\n\nStrategic Storytelling\n\nJessica Hilt, University of California, San Diego\n\nWe often want to convince someone to approve a budget item or understand a decision but fail to persuade them with data alone. \"Storytelling\" is becoming a hot, new business term but unless youâ€™re launching a Kickstarter campaign, it might be hard to understand how it applies to day-to-day business. This talk explains IT storytelling but fills in the gap between \"buzzword\" and practical application by providing step-by-step advice on how to use storytelling in projects, meetings, and interviews to persuade, enlighten, and motivate others.\n\nView the full LISA16 Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa16/conference-program"
