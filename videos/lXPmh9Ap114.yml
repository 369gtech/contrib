description: "Jim Thomson and David Laing, Pivotal\n\nEveryone knows about error budgets (most every SRE at this conference, anyway) and how to use them to manage availability.\n\nBut what about operations outcomes beyond availability, like _security_ and _feature freshness_? In this talk, we'll describe how to apply the error budget model to measure and improve security and feature value and mitigate the risk of change. And we'll give you the tools to brag about your success.\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
