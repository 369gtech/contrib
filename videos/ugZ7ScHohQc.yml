title: 'CON5673   Building a Microservice Ecosystem   Some Assembly Still Required'
language: English
recordingDate: 1453267760
description: "Microservice platforms are finally becoming a reality: Mesos, Kubernetes, and a whole bunch of PaaS-style offerings are available, but the reality is that these platforms still don’t provide everything you need in order to build a fully functional microservice ecosystem. Come to this session to learn about the essential deployment, orchestration, and glue components that often have to be self-assembled. The presentation begins by looking at deployment techniques and tools and examines where to test (QA, staging, or production), how to test (integration and contracts), and how to separate deployment and release. It then discusses orchestration, configuration, and service discovery. Finally it looks at essential glue such as logging, monitoring, and alerting.\n\nSpeaker:\nDaniel Bryant is a Principal Consultant at OpenCredo, a software consultancy and delivery company dedicated to helping our clients deliver better software faster.
