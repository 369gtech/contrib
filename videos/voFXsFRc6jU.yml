Web Workers promise to help us find that balance and let us build fast and responsive applications even when doing heavy work, but the APIs for working with them leave much to be desired. In this talk, weâ€™ll explore useful patterns for making Web Workers easier to work with and highlight effective ways to communicate between workers, handle complex data processing off the main thread, and test and debug them.\n \n\nWhat are the key takeaways from this talk?\n- How to use Web Workers to handle complex data processing off the main thread\n- Patterns and libraries to make working with Web Workers easier\n- Strategies for testing and debugging Web Workers\n- Examples of Web Workers being used in real projects\n\n\nResources:\n- Web Workers spec: www.w3.org/TR/workers/ \n- Promise Worker: github.com/nolanlawson/promise-worker \n- Workerize: github.com/developit/workerize \n- Greenlet: github.com/developit/greenlet \n- Lumen: bit.ly/netflix-lumen \n- Worker DOM: github.com/ampproject/worker-dom \n- Game of Life Demo: canvas-of-life.glitch.me \n- Worker Box: github.com/trentmwillis/worker-box\n\n\nTrent Willis (@trentmwillis) is a Senior UI Engineer at Netflix, where he builds tools and applications to give others insight into their applications. He is the project lead for the QUnit testing framework and contributor to various Open Source projects.\n\nSign up for our Newsletter to receive preview-links every other Thursday starting 2019, April 04: https://js-kongress.us13.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=9c3420f6b5269855b07422fb5&id=f490a69da5"
