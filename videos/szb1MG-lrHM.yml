title: 'Building a Mobile Flight Simulator - Clifford Agius - NDC London 2021'
language: English
recordingDate: 1623831899
description: "Rebuilding the British Airways Mobile Flight simulator that is used to teach aviation STEM subjects to children or be a centerpiece at a Corporate event.\n\nThe simulator is based on a Boeing 787 and is fitted into the back of a trailer that can be best described as a burger van. In here you enter the world of flight sitting next to a BA line pilot while you try and land a 200Tonne aircraft.\n\nIn building the simulator there is a lot of IOT for the controls and instruments as well as a bespoke Application written to enable the Instructor to be able to control the simulator. This App can control where the Aircraft is, the weather, and even throw in an emergency or two.\n\nIn this talk, I will cover the details of the Simulator and how we built it as well as the Tech used, I will even show the DotNet code that went into the Instructors station.\n\nCome along and really get your geek on with Aviation, Code, and IOT all in one talk.\n\nWalk away having learned how to build your own simulator seen how you can control a simulated world from DotNet and a little IOT as well."
