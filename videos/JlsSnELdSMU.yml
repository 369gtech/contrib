description: "Speaker: Thomas Risberg\nBig Data Track\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/spring-one2gx-2014springforapachehadoop\nLeverage your existing Java and Spring skills when making the jump to write applications and workflows for Apache Hadoop. In this presentation we will introduce the Spring for Apache Hadoop project and see how it can make developing workflows with Map Reduce, Hive and Pig jobs easier, while providing portability across ASF, Cloudera, HortonWorks, and Pivotal distros. We'll also look at integration with Spring XD, batch jobs and external data sources. In addition to all this we'll show how use a mini-cluster to test your new Hadoop workflows without having to deploy to a full cluster."
