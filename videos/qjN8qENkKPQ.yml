description: 'Everyone wants awesome architecture in their project. The kind of architecture you can gladly show at conferences: scalable, secure, testable, and without technical debt. But how can we be sure we''re going in the right direction? How do we quantify success? Is it possible to describe technical debt with valuable numbers, better than meaningless "man days to fix"? During my presentation, I will show you that you can do it with engineering - based on a calculator and set square. The time of carefree artists and ivory towers has passed.'
