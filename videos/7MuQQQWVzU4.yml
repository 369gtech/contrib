title: 'Writing a PEG Parser For Fun and Profit'

description: "Parsing Expression Grammars (PEGs) are a relatively new formalism for describing grammars suitable for automatically generating efficient parsers. I've become interested in using a PEG-generated parser as an alternative to CPython's nearly 30 year old \"pgen\" parser generator. This poses some interesting problems. I've also come up with a neat way of visualizing the parsing process, which is helpful for debugging both the grammar and the parsing machinery, and which I'll use to explain the PEG parsing process in general.\n\nEVENT:\n\nNorth Bay Python 2019\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nGuido van Rossum\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed)\n\nATTRIBUTION CREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QppWTvh7_sI"
