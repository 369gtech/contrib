title: 'Graphs in your APIs: Simple service with Python based on GraphQL and Neo4J'
language: English
recordingDate: 1608809633
description: "Nowadays engineers try to think more and more in terms of networks. Reducing the complexity of dealing with the information underlying these networks is a goal that many communities of engineers and developers have to face.\n\nIn the python community we count with powerful tools and packages to present this information in an efficient manner. In this session with Javier Mart√≠nez, a data engineer at Wefox, we implement a simple REST API to understand the state of the art of python using graphQL to interact with the clients and neo4J as a database.\n\nThe outcome is a better understanding of how thinking about graphs could bring benefits to your APIs. Thank you Javier for this interesting  talk!\n\nFor more information about Codurance, please visit our website: https://codurance.com/."
