recordingDate: 1366044405
description: "Google's Dirk Ginader thinks great developers are lazy, and there's nothing wrong with that. After all, would you rather spend your time working on the mundane stuff — like minification, linting, compilation, unit testing, etc — or actually developing your code?\n\nIn this presentation from HTML5DevConf, Dirk will show you how to set up the Grunt JavaScript Task Runner so that you and your team can focus on the fun!\n\n**More educational videos, resources, and enterprise level HTML5 training at http://marakana.com/"
