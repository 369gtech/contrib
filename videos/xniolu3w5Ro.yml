recordingDate: 1572514868
description: "The fugu, or pufferfish, is a toxic, potentially lethal delicacy that, prepared correctly, is a culinary masterpiece.\n\nThe web platform is less deadly, but still requires careful preparation when incubating new features. Project Fugu is the Chrome team's initiative to bring more power to the platform. Many of the experiments are trials or behind flags to ensure they are being prepared correctly.\n\nIn this session we'll investigate the features that are coming out of the Fugu kitchen, have a taste of some that are nearly ready and take a peek into the future to see what's in store for 2020. By the end you'll be equipped with the features to make your web application a masterpiece too.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks, courses, and conferences in the following links:\nhttps://ndcsydney.com/\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
