This Book Club episode is an expansion of a recent interview between Nora Jones and Casey Rosenthal on the comedic Chaos Community Broadcast [https://chaos.community].  We now include expanded conversation, including discussion about Nora's work with the Learning from Incidents community.\n\nChaos engineering is much more than just hype. Get the map and compass that you need to navigate the stormy waters of distributed systems while optimizing to meet business goals. Casey Rosenthal and Nora Jones, authors of “Chaos Engineering,” highlight some of the best practices that famous companies like Netflix and Capital One use to break (or not break) their systems in productions, so that you can get a taste of it.\nThe interview is based on Nora Jones's and Casey Rosenthal's new book \"Chaos Engineering\": https://www.verica.io/book\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Series intro\n00:48 Episode intro\n01:10 Nora's journey to chaos engineering\n04:20 To what would you attribute your success?\n08:05 Collaboration and learning from incidents\n13:38 Netflix and chaos engineering\n16:49 A facilitator's role in chaos engineering\n22:32 Differences between chaos engineering & root cause analysis\n24:07 Best way to adapt a post-mortem template\n25:57 Outro\n\nRead the full transcription of the interview here:\nhttps://gotopia.tech/bookclub/episodes/getting-started-with-chaos-engineering\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nhttps://www.verica.io/book\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#ChaosEngineering #Programming #NoraJones #CaseyRosenthal #JamesWickett #RootCauseAnalysis #PostMortemTemplate\n\nSUPPORTER\nVerica uses chaos engineering to make systems more secure and less vulnerable to costly incidents.\nWith Verica, you can trust that your software is working how it’s meant to. As systems become more complex, Verica will be there to help maintain confidence in those systems.\nhttps://www.verica.io/book\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
