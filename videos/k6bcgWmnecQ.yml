description: "Speaker(s):\nEric Lukoff, Stefan Nilsson, Steph Hannon, Susan Mernit\n\nDescription:\nThere's arguably no area today where innovation is more critical than in the nonprofit sector â€” it's an area trying to reach billions of people and crack some of the most complex issues faced by society. From expanding access to social services for low-income residents to improving access to education, social entrepreneurs are increasingly using technology to create new solutions to old problems. Google's Impact Challenges travel the world asking social entrepreneurs to tell us their ideas for using technology to make their local community a better place. Winners receive funding and Google support to make their ideas a reality. This is a unique opportunity to hear from three Bay Area winners, One Degree, Beyond 12 and Hack the Hood, understand their inspiration for changing the world, and learn about how you as a developer can do transformative things with technology in your local community.\n\nWatch all Google I/O 2014 videos at: g.co/io14videos"
