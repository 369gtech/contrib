description: "DOES19 Las Vegas â€” Today's DoD software acquisition and development is not responsive to our warfighter needs. As a result, DoD's ability to keep pace with our potential adversaries is falling behind. The only solution is to use DevOps as modern software development practices, processes, and tools to revolutionize the Department's ability to provide responsive, timely and secure software capabilities for our warfighters. However, this is not an easy task to implement DevSecOps across various systems in DoD enterprise. Even though there are lots of barriers present ranging from cultural to system architecture and tooling complexity, DoD is adapting DevSecOps quickly.\n\nDOES19 Las Vegas\nDOES 2019 US\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
