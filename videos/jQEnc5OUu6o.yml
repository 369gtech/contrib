Sure, you can fire up a Google Spreadsheet, open a dozen remote PCs, gather as many mobile devices as possible, and transcribe your test results. Or, you can take 2 minutes to create a Browserscope user test and have all the results gathered for you while enlisting the power of the crowd. We'll take a look at the latter.\n\nSteve works at Google on web performance and open source initiatives. He previously served as Chief Performance Yahoo!. Steve is the author of High Performance Web Sites and Even Faster Web Sites. He is the creator of YSlow, one of the top 25 of 2 billion Firefox add-ons.

He serves as co-chair of Velocity, the web performance and operations conference from O'Reilly, and is co-founder of the Firebug Working Group.
