description: "Marcus Hellberg, Lead Developer Advocate, Vaadin\n\nThe web is turning into an application platform. Web Components gives us a way of defining reusable UI components, and Progressive Web Apps improve performance in poor network conditions. You can install them on your phone, and they can send you notifications for important events. This presentation involves building a small application from scratch. You’ll learn the basics of Web Components and Progressive Web Apps through examples. After the session, you’ll have the skills needed to start working on your own PWA."
