title: 'Send It to the Background: REST Synchronizations and Automations'
language: English
recordingDate: 1627068277
description: "Automations and REST Synchronizations are the first declarative APEX features which execute in the backgroundâ€”without the developer having to manually implement a scheduler job. This makes it super easy to load data from an external REST API on schedule and to transform it using SQL or PL/SQL statements afterward. Combined with other REST Source enhancements, like REST source plugins or the new CSV support, this becomes a powerful tool to get and transform data from external sources. In this session, we introduced these features, showed how to use them, and provided some tips and tricks for daily usage.\n\n1:43 - New Features Requests App\n11:17: - Send It to the Background: REST Synchronizations and Automations\n19:05 - Demo\n50:38 - Q&A"
