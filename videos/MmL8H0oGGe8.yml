description: "Once Ada Lovelace invented programming Jane Austen knew it wasn't going to end well unless she invented Operations.\nShe proposed DevOps in the early 19th century in a series of coded stories with titles like \"Support and Supportability\". DevOps is a synthesis of agile development practises—small releases, high automation, close collaboration—with the \"keeping the lights on\" rigour and discipline of the Operations Centre. For it to succeed we need to learn to treat Ops as equals to Dev rather than voiceless downstream consumers."
