title: 'Securing JAX-RS Services with OAuth 2'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433260866
description: "The popularity of RESTful APIs has grown significantly in the last few years, and more approaches to solving the issue of securing REST APIs have emerged. OAuth is currently by far the most popular solution for securing publicly exposed REST APIs, primarily thanks to OAuth’s adoption by popular social networks. This session, packed with live demos, covers how and when to use OAuth to secure your REST services developed with JAX-RS. It also introduces OAuth basics and then dives deeper, zooming in on other interesting use cases such as securing access of mobile devices or delegating login authentication by using OpenID Connect. All examples are based on Jersey 2.x, which provides JAX-RS 2.0 reference implementation.\n\n\nAuthor:\n Miroslav Fuksa\nI am a Java developer in Oracle and I work in the Jersey team. I develop Jersey 2.x which provides JAX-RS 2.0 reference implementation. As a team member I am responsible for all areas of Jersey development including architecture, design and development of new features, bug fixing, testing and interaction with Jersey community. My area of specialization is the security. I have added support for OAuth 1 and 2 into Jersey 2.x and I had a session about security in JAX-RS at Java One 2013.\n\nI have joined Jersey team in Oracle in 2012. Before I worked as a developer developing Java enterprise applications. I have been working with Java since 2005.\nView more trainings by  Miroslav Fuksa at https://www.parleys.com/author/miroslav-fuksa-4\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
