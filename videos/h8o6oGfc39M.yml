We will highlight the unique set of challenges that they face during migration to Kubernetes. These enterprises are looking for ways to improve and optimize infrastructure, and adopt cloud-native technologies. Startups want to build innovations on cloud-native architecture for rapid prototyping of their products, quick scalability as their businesses grow, and cost-saving on infrastructure.  In this talk, we will share the factors enabling and hindering the adoption of Kubernetes, community presence and its growth in Africa. We will share how people are contributing to Kubernetes and highlight some of the challenges they face in their journey.\n\nhttps://sched.co/ZenF"
