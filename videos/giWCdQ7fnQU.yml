description: "https://cppcon.org/\nhttps://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2020\n---\nForget factories, singletons, and proxies; What are the real patterns in software development? This talk explores abstract mathematical structures that commonly recur in software development. Once a mind is trained to recognize these patterns, it becomes easy to identify the fundamental operations for domain specific classes and how to put the pieces together. This discussion is for those who enjoy math, abstract concepts, and expanding their minds. \n\n---\nDavid Sankel is a Software Engineering Manager/TL at Bloomberg and an active member of the C++ Standardization Committee. His experience spans microservice architectures, CAD/CAM, computer graphics, visual programming languages, web applications, computer vision, and cryptography. He is a frequent speaker at C++ conferences and specializes in large-scale software engineering and advanced C++ topics. Davidâ€™s interests include dependently typed languages, semantic domains, EDSLs, and functional reactive programming. He is the project editor of the C++ Reflection TS, a member of the Boost steering committee, and an author of serveral C++ proposals including pattern matching and language variants. \n\n---\nStreamed & Edited by Digital Medium Ltd - events.digital-medium.co.uk\nevents@digital-medium.co.uk"
