title: 'Building Scalable, Maintainable Apps Using TypeScript and React - Kamran Ayub'
recordingDate: 1528731490
description: "Building real-world, maintainable applications is hard in JavaScript which is why there’s such a rich ecosystem of frameworks and libraries to help make that easier. React.js is a framework for building components that helps make your front-end more modular. TypeScript is a compile-to-JavaScript language that helps you build scalable and maintainable applications. Separately, they are both awesome technologies but when used together they form an awesome team that allows you to build robust, refactorable, maintainable codebases that can scale to large applications.\n\nIn this session, we’ll take a look at a real-world application that takes full advantage of the scalability features React, Redux and TypeScript provide."
