Wait no longer.\n\nStimulus Reflex is a library for creating realtime, reactive apps in Rails with no Javascript. It keeps track of the action that was used to render your view and uses websockets to re-render the view. It uses DOM diffing to update the DOM so the whole view isn't refreshed. \n\nWith all of these features combined, you end up with an extremely interesting approach to building reactive applications in Rails."
