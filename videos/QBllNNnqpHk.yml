title: 'Scaling Qt from Desktop to Servers and Micro-controllers - Volker Hilsheimer'
recordingDate: 1569838329
description: "Qt started in the mid 90's as a cross-platform framework for building native desktop applications, and gained popularity through KDE, Adobe Photoshop Elements, or Google Earth.\nWith embedded, mobile, web, and cloud platforms making software and software services a central part of everyone's life, Qt's cross-platform promise has taken on a completely new relevance.\n\nIn this talk, I'll show how developers can get great value out of their C++ and Qt experience, no matter which platform they target. Backend functionality for implementing web services, efficient UI creation for embedded targets, optimisation strategies when developing for micro-controllers.\n\nSave the date for NDC TechTown 2020  (31st of August - 3rd of September)\n\nCheck out more of our talks at: \nhttps://ndctechtown.com/\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/"
