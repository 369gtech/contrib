description: "Join us for our next conference: https://goo.gl/B2bqQ6\n\nFebruary 2017 will mark a year since I started in a role aimed at radically changing how Indeed thinks about front-end engineering. In this talk, I’ll share some hard-earned lessons – and likely a regret or two – about my experience influencing developers, managers, and product owners across a large engineering organization; identifying a Plan B on those occasions when Plan A wasn’t working out; and prioritizing a seemingly endless stream of demands and opportunities as I worked to grow the front-end specialization at Indeed beyond a team of one.\n\nRebecca Murphey is a senior software engineer at Indeed, where she works to evangelize, facilitate, and implement front-end best practices across applications that reach hundreds of millions of job-seekers every month. She lives in Austin, TX with her partner and their son.\n\n---\n\nWhen you’re busy leading a team, coding and maintaining standards, how do you find the time to stay ahead of new technologies and develop yourself as a technical lead?\n\nThe Lead Developer conference features practical advice from experts on leading and motivating your team and high-level sessions on new and disruptive technologies.\n\nGet tickets at theleaddeveloper.com"
