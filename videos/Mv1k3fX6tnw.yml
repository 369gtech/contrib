recordingDate: 1502110706
description: "As data sources become more numerous, value is extracted from them by recognizing the relationships and patterns between them. Machine learning is a booming field that attempts to tackle this challenge and help companies extract value from their data. In this session learn how graphs model relationships and patterns between data elements by being able to link them through edges, or cluster them around nodes. Applying machine learning algorithms designed for graphs takes the pre-existing relationships in the modeled graph into account and can help to extract more.\n\nSpeaker: Davide Bartolini"
