description: "This video was recorded at virtual Code BEAM V America conference, which took place on 10-12th March 2021 - https://codesync.global/conferences/code-beam-v-america-2021/\n\nMore great virtual tech conferences - https://codesync.global​ \n\n---\n\nForum over Functions \nby Randall Thomas\n\nABSTRACT\nWhat 20+ years of bad languages, awful frameworks, and half-assed implementations tell us about Elixir, Erlang, and the future of BEAM?\n\nHe who cannot remember history is doomed to repeat it—an apt aphorism summing up the last 30 years of software development if ever there was one. We will take a walk down memory lane and identify the mistakes languages and frameworks seem to make over and over again and why languages like Elixir might just help us get out of the vicious cycle.\n\n---\n\nSPEAKER - Randall Thomas\nRandall Thomas (@daksis) is a classically trained musician that took one too many calculus classes and got sucked into geekery: computers, robots, video games, high energy physics - the usual suspects.\nAfflicted with rabid technology ADD, Randall has built companies in various industries with numerous startups -- everything from robotics to digital video to cloud computing. After escaping a high-security military prison and driving a heavily armed conversion van filled with ex spec-ops soldiers for hire around the Los Angeles underground,\nRandall founded Thunderbolt Labs - a software consultancy that teaches companies how to build better software by embedding with their teams and building it beside them.Randall is an internationally recognized speaker on practical data techniques and the insanely nonsensical business of startups.When not glued to a computer Randall is likely lost in a book or on a running trail wondering if he will get to the end of either. He has a fondness for good food and weakness for great whiskey and will happily discuss either at length.\n\n---\n\nCode BEAM V America\nWebsite: https://codesync.global/conferences/code-beam-v-america-2021/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/CodeBEAMio"
