description: "Google Tech Talks\nMarch 15, 2007\n\nABSTRACT\n\nWith the rise of chip-multiprocessors (CMPs) as the high-performance architecture of choice, programmers must now find and extract parallelism from their applications to see continued performance improvements. Previous analysis of long-running non-scientific (e.g., SPECint like) program trace data has shown that a fair amount of parallelism is present in modern sequential applications, but this parallelism cannot be exploited via the classic instruction-level parallel approach. Despite the promise of extracting this parallelism for CMPs, no work characterizes which code sequences are parallelizable because these large traces (e.g., terabytes in size,..."
