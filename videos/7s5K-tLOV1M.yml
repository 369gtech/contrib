title: 'Lady Red / Christopher Beacham - A Medieval DSL? Parsing Heraldic Blazons with Python! - PyCon 2019'
recordingDate: 1557110999
description: "\"Speaker: Lady Red / Christopher Beacham\n\nMedieval European Nobility was obsessed with Lineage. They created a Heraldic System to track families, which assigned each family a unique Coat of Arms.\n\nAny painting of the Coat of Arms was not the official version. The official version was a \"\"Blazon\"\" - a precise, terse description in heraldic language.   This heraldic language reads like English, Latin, French, and XML had a baby.  It's a fully recursive language with a formal grammar, variable assignment, positional arguments, and also, Lions, Bears, and Pythons.\n\nHere's an example: _Sable, on a fesse or three lions gules_\n\nIn this talk, we look at parsing this Medieval _Domain Specific Language_ with Python. Along the way, we'll learn a little history, and the tools for parsing and writing your own DSL.\n\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2019 and https://github.com/PyCon/2019-slides\""
