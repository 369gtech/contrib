language: English
recordingDate: 1595761213
description: "In this talk, I will briefly remind you what undefined behaviour is and what dangers it can bring to our software - to our products. Then I'll demonstrate that the undefined behaviour is there even in the standard library, in containers, in algorithms. Moreover, I will explain that such behaviour was introduced with care and purpose. We will go through some more interesting cases and we will also see how we can protect ourselves.\n\n-------\nPassionate software developer. Obsessed clean coder. Enthusiastic blogger. Husband of an awesome wife. Happy father of two children.\n\n-------\n\nC++ on Sea is an annual c++ and coding conference, usually held in Folkestone, Kent in the UK. The 2020 conference was moved to a virtual event due to social distancing requirements.\n\nProduced and Edited by Digital Medium Ltd: https://events.digital-medium.co.uk\nEnquiries: events@digital-medium.co.uk"
