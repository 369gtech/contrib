In late 2017, he volunteered to implement C++20 Concepts in the Clang compiler, and has been working on that since, having recently reached a feature-complete beta stage. \nOther than C++ and tech, Saar also likes graphic design and playing video games.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
