description: "You can make shapes in HTML and CSS. Sometimes it involves some trickery, like exploiting how borders connect to make a triangle, extreme border-radius to make circles, or layering pseudo elements and transforms to make more complex shapes.\n\nBut there are also some shape functions right in CSS. Things like circle(), polygon(), and path(). But where can you use them? And how? And for what? That’s exactly what Chris will be looking at in this talk. He’ll have some fun building a fan site and using four different shape-related properties in CSS.\n\nChris Coyier\nhttps://twitter.com/chriscoyier\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc\n\nSave 10% off any FITC event with discount code 'youtube'.\nSee our upcoming events at www.fitc.ca"
