description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nFair Scheduling for Deep Learning Workloads in Kubernetes - Yodar Shafrir, Run:AI\n\nIn this talk we will deep dive into pod scheduling in Kubernetes. We'll discuss the importance of fair scheduling in use cases where Data Scientists share a cluster with a limited number of GPUs and examine the requirements for a fair scheduling solution. We'll look at the architecture and components of the Kubernetes scheduling and discuss how we can achieve fairness. We will also share some of the building blocks we used when building our own fair scheduler."
