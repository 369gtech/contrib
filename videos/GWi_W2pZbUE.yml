Is there part of it that can be used in real life scenarios?\nCome and find out!\nYes, there will be some live demo.\n\n\nThis event would not take place without the support of sponsors:\n\nPlatinum Sponsors\nFocus Reactive → https://focusreactive.com/  \n\nGold Sponsors\nAWS Amplify → https://docs.amplify.aws/ \nRetool → https://retool.com/ \nEpsagon → https://epsagon.com/ \nInfluxdata → https://www.influxdata.com/ \nStackHawk → https://www.stackhawk.com/ \nG2i → https://www.g2i.co/  \n\nSilver Sponsors\nAppSignal → https://appsignal.com/ \nSailscasts → https://sailscasts.com/ \n \nDiversity Sponsor\nPrisma → https://www.prisma.io/"
