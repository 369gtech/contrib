language: English
recordingDate: 1525978173
description: "A team of female Google software engineers developed two interactive demos using Android Things for the Women Techmakers event at the 2017 Grace Hopper Conference: Rosie the Robot - a fully controllable robot, that can take photos and wheel around to interact with participants; and Steve the Tree - a 20x20 foot installment that reacts to sensor input, displays light arrays, and is controlled using Firebase. This discussion panel will showcase lessons learned, how experts in software approached hardware development, and how Android Things enabled them to create the demos.\n\nWatch more IoT sessions from I/O '18 here ? https://goo.gl/xfowJ8\nSee all the sessions from Google I/O '18 here ? https://goo.gl/q1Tr8x\n\nSubscribe to the Google Developers channel ? http://goo.gl/mQyv5L\n\n#io18"
