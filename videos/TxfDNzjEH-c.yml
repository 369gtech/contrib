title: 'George Eid - Designing for Mobile: Context Matters (DevFest Baltics)'
recordingDate: 1530806512
description: "Context is a primary consideration when designing a user interface and as mobile asserts its dominance, many designers adhere to a mobile-first approach. The question is, should context stop at the device level? Today weâ€™re seeing a blurring of the lines, with UI elements making their way from native apps to mobile web, and vice versa. While some standardization makes sense, there is still inherent differences that need to be taken into account. Join creative technologist George Eid for a talk and Q&A on designing for mobile. Framed by the principles of Design Thinking and Collaborative Design, his talk will include an introduction to AREA 17, their philosophy towards mobile design, and actionable design techniques for designers and developers alike.\n\nMore information about awesome conference: https://devfest.gdg.lv"
