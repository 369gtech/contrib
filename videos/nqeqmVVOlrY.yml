description: "Docker and Kubernetes are two very competent, and one of the most heavily used, container orchestration frameworks. This code-driven session will compare and contrast Docker Swarm and Kubernetes on the following aspects:\n\n* Local development\n* Deployment options\n* Multi-container applications\n* Service discovery\n* Scaling service\n* Run-once jobs\n* Maven integration\n* Rolling updates\n* Creating a Couchbase cluster\n\nAttendees will have a clear understanding of what each orchestration framework has to offer. They will also learn techniques for using these platforms effectively.\n\nArun Gupta is the vice president of developer advocacy at Couchbase. He has been building developer communities for 10+ years at Sun, Oracle, and Red Hat. He has deep expertise in leading cross-functional teams to develop and execute strategy, planning and execution of content, marketing campaigns, and programs.\n\nGupta has authored more than 2,000 blog posts on technology. He has extensive speaking experience in more than 40 countries on myriad topics and is a JavaOne Rock Star. Gupta also founded the Devoxx4Kids chapter in the US and continues to promote technology education among children. An author of a best-selling book, an avid runner, a Java Champion, and a JUG leader, Docker Captain, he is easily accessible at @arungupta."
