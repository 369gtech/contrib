description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2020 by Sandra Dupré, Disney Streaming services.\n\nMore info: https://android-makers-2020.firebaseapp.com/schedule/?sessionId=175102\n\nOne of our goal as an Android developer is to provide a nice and smooth UI to our guest. \r\nReleased with ConstraintLayout 2.0, MotionLayout is the new animation toy for Android Developers. This new tool proves to be simple, practical and allows you to create fancy animation in a short amount of time. But in practice, is this beta library really stable? \r\nIn Disney+, we have been using this library on development for more than a year, on mobile, tablet and TV. Integration, improvements and bugs, I want to tell you more about our MotionLayout adventure in Disney+."
