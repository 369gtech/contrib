description: "Speaker: Woody Zuill (@WoodyZuill), Agile Guide, Trainer, Developer @ Zuill Development\n\nMob Programming is a development practice where the whole team works on the same thing, at the same time, in the same space, and on the same computer. It is a whole-team approach to doing all the work the team does including designing, coding, testing, and working with the customers, users and other stakeholders. This is an evolutionary step beyond pair programming and accentuates face-to-face communication, team alignment, collaboration, and self-organizing team concepts of the Agile approach to software development.\n\nMob Programming can be a highly effective approach to software development. There are numerous teams doing Mob Programming all over the world, including distributed teams, and there has been a great deal of positive reports of success. Please join me as I share how the concept got started, the benefits, techniques we use, and some of the problems we've faced.\n\nAbout the speaker\n\nWoody Zuill is an independent Agile Guide and Coach and has been programming computers for 30+ years. He is a pioneer of the Mob Programming approach to teamwork in software development, and is considered one of the founders of the \"#NoEstimates\" discussion on Twitter.  His passion is to work with teams to create an environment where everyone of us can excel in our work and in their lives.\n\nEvent Page: http://2016.agilesingapore.org\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/XvSv/"
