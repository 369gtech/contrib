description: "A Basic Kubernetes Debugging Kit: curl, jq, openssl, and Other Best Friends - Joe Thompson, Mesosphere \n\nJoe Thompson walks you through a set of essential command-line Linux tools – curl, jq, openssl, netcat, dig and others – and how to use them to debug network and other issues in your Kubernetes clusters. The basic function and use of each tool is covered, with examples for some common Kubernetes-related tasks like verifying if a certificate is correctly generated or checking if DNS resolution in your cluster is working properly. We’ll also look at some container-based debugging procedures, including how to use one container to debug another that’s not running properly or to debug the host OS when the tools you need aren’t installed there. \n\nTo Learn More: https://sched.co/GrYA"
