description: 'When it comes to taking advantage of SMB connections, most tools available to penetration testers aim for system enumeration or for performing relay attacks to gain RCE. If signatures are required, or if the victims relayed are not local admins anywhere, that can put a real stint in leveraging SMB to gain any serious footholds in a network. Fortunately, the mentioned attacks are only the tip of the iceberg of the ways to gain RCE with insecure SMB connections – and there’s a new tool to help take full advantage of these opportunities.'
