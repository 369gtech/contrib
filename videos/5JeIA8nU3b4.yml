description: "Instagration: A Case Study in Cloud Migration at Scale\n\nChris Bray, Facebook/Instagram\n\nInstagram recently completed a large migration from AWS to Facebook's internal systems. This talk will go into more detail of what and how the team accomplished a very large scale AWS migration. It will touch on tools and lessons learned that Instagram applied to their migration that others might be able to both utilize and apply to their migration (to or from AWS) to help make it as painless and trouble free as possible.\n\nView the SREcon15 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon15/program"
