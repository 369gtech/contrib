description: "Video from Devoxx Poland 2019.\n\nUnit testing is pure and simple. However, some things cannot be tested that way or testing them in separation is just not feasible. In that case integration/functional tests are knocking to our doors, dragging all those limitations and complexity along. Databases, message brokers, external systems and more to struggle... Nevertheless, there are tools which can help to take it under control.\n\nDuring my talk I will provide a quick introduction to managing Docker containers during your integration/functional testing lifecycle. The Testcontainers library in cooperation with JUnit/Spock will be used to cover a few most common use cases."
