title: 'Albert Lewandowski – Kubernetes & real-time analytics: How to connect these worlds with Apache Flink'
recordingDate: 1630933775
description: "More and more services are running in Kubernetes so it means that we can migrate our current data pipelines to the new environment. In case of Flink we have multiple ways to do real-time data streaming: use Lyft or GCP operator, go with official deployment and customize it or choose the Ververica Platform or create something on your own. The presentation shows how to choose the right solution for technical requirements and business needs to run Flink in Kubernetes at great scale with no issues.\n\nSpeaker:\nAlbert Lewandowski – https://2021.berlinbuzzwords.de/member/albert-lewandowski\n\nMore: https://2021.berlinbuzzwords.de/session/kubernetes-and-real-time-analytics-how-connect-these-two-worlds-apache-flink"
