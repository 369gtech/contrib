title: 'Large Scale Real Time Ad Invalid Traffic Detection with Flink - Fares Sabbagh & Juan Gentile'
recordingDate: 1571310818
description: 'Criteo is receiving 300 billion Ad bid requests and performing 4 billion displays daily, to protect our advertisers from Invalid Traffic, we need a real-time stream processing framework that fits our scale and can help us detect those invalid traffic. We are going to talk about the Invalid Traffic Detection Architecture in Criteo, and focus on our stream processing rule engine and how it evolves from Kafka Streams to Flink, where we leverage the SQL API to quickly create new business rules. As well as the technical challenges we encountered on the way and how did we solve them.'
