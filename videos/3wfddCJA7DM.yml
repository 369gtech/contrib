description: "There has been a renaissance in conversational interfaces over the last few years. More and more businesses are using bots with interfaces that emulate human to human conversations to meet the needs of their customers, with some believing that conversations are going to eventually become the primary way of interacting with computers. It sounds simple: talking and chatting comes natural to us, so we should be moving towards communicating with machines in the same way, but is it?\n\nDespite the hype, at the moment both voice and chat interactions have various usability issues that very often prevent them from providing a great user experience. In my talk, I will be drawing on my experience leading Avivaâ€™s conversational UX projects to discuss what those usability issues are and how can designers work around them. I will also share my thoughts on how the conversational interface will evolve by incorporating elements from various types of interaction and modalities to meet user needs in a more effective way.\n\nEVENT:\n\nMUXL Conference 2019\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nStratis Valachis\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nATTRIBUTION CREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZIRgwUd71Y&t=34s"
