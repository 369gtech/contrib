title: 'Learning from Disaster - Ian Hughes'
recordingDate: 1599213388
description: "In 2019 more than 4.5 billion passengers were carried on 43 million commercial scheduled flights. Airlines connect our world and provide one of the cheapest and safest modes of transportation available. But when things go wrong, they go spectacularly wrong. Plane crashes provoke a morbid fascination for people; piquing our curiosity imagining the terror that must have ensued.\n\nIn this session we'll look at air crashes that changed the industry, how airlines and global regulating bodies made sure they never happened again, and what lessons we in IT can learn from them."
