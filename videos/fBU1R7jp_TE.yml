description: "http://www.cppcon.org\nâ€”\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2014\n--\nAfter the grand expansion of the C++11 library, the extensions in C++14 are more modest, often tweaking and cleaning up existing components.\n\nAlisdair Meredith, the Library Working Group chair, walks through all these changes and additions, and a little insight into features that did not make the cut, and are expected to arrive in other Technical Specification before the next standard ships.\n--\nAlisdair Meredith is a software developer at BloombergLP in New York, and the C++ Standard Committee Library Working Group chair.\n\nHe has been an active member of the C++ committee for just over a decade, and by a lucky co-incidence his first meeting was the kick-off meeting for the project that would become C++11, and also fixed the contents of the original library TR.\n\nHe is currently working on the BDE project, BloombergLP's open source libraries that offer a foundation for C++ development, including a standard library implementation supporting the polymorphic allocator model proposed for standardization.\n--\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
