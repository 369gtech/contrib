description: "Think back 10 to 15 years ago, there was probably a kid in your neighborhood that you could pay a couple bucks to wash your car or mow your lawn. We've lost that sense of community over the years because the age of the internet has siloed us. With the social networking in full force, that is changing. Social, location, and mobile technologies are creating a meaningful foundation to connect a neighborhood both on and offline. Technology has finally caught up to human behavior, and we are able to use the internet to get off the internet and build a strong community together. Leah will discuss how these technology trends are paving the way for new marketplace businesses and why they are so important to the success of these models.\n\nLeah Busque\n\nTaskRabbit\n\nA true visionary, Leah originated the phrase, \"service networking,\" a now industry-wide term describing the productive and service power of a web-based social networked community. In the fall of 2008, while trying to figure out how to juggle dinner out with her husband, Kevin, and buying dog food for her 100-pound yellow labrador retriever, Kobe, Leah's flash of inspiration resulted in her registering the RunMyErrand.com domain name from her iPhone, and mapping the entire business model in her head prior to their meal. Eighteen months later, the company is flourishing, and has expanded and evolved into TaskRabbit.com.\n\nIn 2001, Leah graduated magna cum laude from Sweet Briar College, earning a Bachelors of Science in Mathematics and Computer Science. At Sweet Briar, Leah served as the Student Government Association president, and after graduating, was honored to serve as a Young Alumna Trustee on the Board of Directors of the College for a three-year term.\n\nImmediately after graduation, Leah started a career at IBM, Westford, MA, as a Software Engineer, working in the Messaging and Collaboration Software Development group. There she focused on engineering software that millions of people around the globe use daily, securing patent applications for software algorithms, speaking at annual conferences, and publishing in technical journals.\n\nA Boston native, Leah is a volunteer math tutor for the Boys and Girls Club of Boston, and returns often to Sweet Briar College as a guest lecturer for women and entrepreneurship. Leah enjoys theater, dance, and spending time with her husband, Kevin, and 100lb yellow lab Kobe."
