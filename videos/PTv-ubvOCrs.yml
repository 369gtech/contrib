description: "Lately, Android applications are becoming more complex by the hour. In this world, the architecture of your app has to step up to remain easy to maintain and scale.\n\nYou have probably heard about \"Clean Architecture\", or you are already into it. The goal is to define different layers which have single responsibilities and good decoupling.\n\nIn this talk we want to cover a specific layer, the data layer. We will explore how to use the Repository pattern to implement a Single Source of Truth in a clean way, but most importantly, why we failed at our first attempt so you can avoid making the same mistakes we did.\n\nhttps://it.droidcon.com/2019/it\nhttps://twitter.com/droidconit\nhttps://www.facebook.com/droidconIt"
