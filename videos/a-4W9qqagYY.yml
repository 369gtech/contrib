description: "2014 was the year of the Smart Home - not only have Apple, Google/Nest and Samsung/SmartThings entered the stage, but there was a lot of buzz around the Internet of Things in general and Smart Homes in particular. After the 'smartphone battle' the 'smarthome battle' is now at the horizon for this year. Wouldn't it be great to escape from this battle and use something truly open and independent instead?\n\nThe Eclipse SmartHome project fills this gap. It was initiated by the popular open-source project openHAB, which makes it possible to realize advanced vendor-independent home automation use cases in no time. While openHAB's target audience were so far tech-savvy people and early adopters, the Eclipse SmartHome project leads the way from the niche to the mass market by fostering industry adoption as it provides a flexible framework with many options for building Smart Home solutions.\n\nThis session includes live hacking and you will of course see a smart home live demo that goes way beyond the standard use cases."
