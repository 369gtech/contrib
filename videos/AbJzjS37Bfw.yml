description: "Speaker: MARIUS BOGOEVICI SPRING CLOUD STREAM LEAD\nJoin us for an introduction to Spring Cloud Stream, a framework for creating event-driven microservices that builds on on the ease of development and execution of Spring Boot, the cloud-native capabilities of Spring Cloud, and the message-driven programming model of Spring Integration. See how Spring Cloud Streamâ€™s abstractions and opinionated primitives allow you to easily build applications that can interchangeably use RabbitMQ, Kafka or Google PubSub without changing the application logic. Finally, we will show how these applications can be orchestrated and deployed on different modern runtimes such as Cloud Foundry, Kubernetes or Mesos using Spring Cloud Data Flow."
