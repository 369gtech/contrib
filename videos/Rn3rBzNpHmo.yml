title: 'Yizhar Toren – Comparing apples to apple trees: Injecting domain knowledge to similarity searches'
recordingDate: 1631092416
description: "Image & text similarity problems have plenty of textbook ML solutions. However in the wild, these solutions often fail. In this talk I'll present a use-case about inferring product similarity from multiple sources of data (images, text, etc) and discuss how we developed a practical & scalable approach using our understanding of domain knowledge.\n\nSpeaker:\nYizhar \"Izzy\" Toren – https://2021.berlinbuzzwords.de/member/yizhar-toren\n\nMore: https://2021.berlinbuzzwords.de/session/comparing-apples-apple-trees-injecting-domain-knowledge-similarity-searches"
