description: "Who said games arenâ€™t educational? Learning a new programming language on your own is never easy, and you often find yourself stuck and frustrated.\n\nIn this session I will talk about how through developing a simple 2D game I was able to wrap my imperative mind around a functional programming language and learn Clojure.\n\nLet me show you how your favorite arcade game can be an excellent tool to master a new programming language, ANY LANGUAGE.\n\nMey is a public speaker, a Software Engineer and a Backend Developer.  \nWhen she is not spending her weekends at hackathons, she experiments with algorithms OR learns languages such as russian, french & Clojure. Mey is also a sworn star wars fan. May the force be with you."
