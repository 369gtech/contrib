description: "Hey, do you remember when everyone was asking what the role of the tester would be in an agile team? It’s happening again!\n\nAnd things are changing again. A team that takes on the challenge to release their every commit certainly will take testing seriously. It will need to evolve new ways of testing. It will have new dynamics of testers working with developers. It will find new ways of of interacting with customers, stakeholders and product owners.\n\nIn this talk we’ll look at how continuous deployment changes the dynamics of an agile team. How quality moves even more to the center of the stage. How that changes the role of the tester once again. How it changes the role of developers, too. How this practice allows you to put the customer center stage again. And how that, too, has testing competencies at its core. And we’ll not forget DevOps, and how monitoring can be a continuous testing strategy."
