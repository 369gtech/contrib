JavaScript was first released with Netscape Navigator 2.0 in September 1995 - can an application from today exist in the browsers of yesterday?\n\nJust how different was the development experience then compared to now? Is it feasible to implement a modern Web application in the browser that pioneered client-side development? What would code from 1995 look like rewritten with today’s JavaScript?\n\nIn this talk I will answer those questions by implementing TodoMVC in some early browsers. When we’re through, we’ll leave with an appreciation of just how far the Web and Web development have come in the last 20 years."
