description: "Discover the fatalistic implication of being insignificantly powerless before such vast, unknowable and fundamentally alien entities and other oddities of Drupal 8.\n\nTake one step away from the comforts of home, and you will find terror and madness on every service and dependency. Dark plugins, hideous annotations, dependency injections so terrible that none may comprehend them and remain sane. Demons gibber in the Symfony substructure beneath your feet.\n\nYou’ve been a Drupal developer for years. For years, you have wrestled with comprehensible hooks and won. For years, you have created complex modules from countless PHP libraries and solved the most terrifying business logic. But now, you awake in the world of Drupal 8, and your procedural understanding will no longer suffice.\n\nChanges on a cosmic scale await in Drupal 8! If insanity is to be the new game, let us finally learn what we must learn. If for some reason, you have yet to embrace dependency injection, plugins, services, event subscriptions, or even simple routes, we can shed off this mortal coil and embrace the new gods. Let us explore the depths of Drupal 8 and embrace what we find, even if it drives us mad in the process.\n\nSpecial note: the Madness Module was developed to help demonstrate the lessons from this session.\n\nThis session is for\n\nDrupal 6 and 7 developers that have yet to embrace the Cosmic Horror of Drupal 8’s new concepts\n\nSelf-taught acolytes of PHP procedural delight that must now awaken to OOP’s harsh, cruel realities\n\nBefuddled Drupalites that find themselves wishing to be devoured first, rather than to be driven mad and then devoured\n\nIt will cover\n\nThe basics of dependency injection and how to use it\n\nWhat is a service and how can we register our code in the service of the Great Old Ones\n\nWhen the old gods awoke, what changes did they bring?\n\nAttendees will learn\n\nWhat’s new in Drupal 8 (For Drupal 7 developers) with a nice Lovecraftian theme\n\nWhat Symfony is, how Symfony is a part of Drupal, and how to surrender to it"
