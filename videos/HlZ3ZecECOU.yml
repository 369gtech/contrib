description: "GraphQL is not new, and REST is still around. Is it already time to switch? What tools can we rely on, as of today? Is the framework ready and suitable for everyone around?\n\nAt The New York Times, we invested heavily on this technology, so much that we actually created a whole new feature around it. Join us to discover the inner depths of GraphQL, how it works and how it can be integrated within a few days. \n\nExplore how you can make sure about what you write and test it out. And when it's time to optimize, maybe we can help it!"
