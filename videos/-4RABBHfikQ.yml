description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nA Series of Fortunate CloudEvents - Ian Coffey, Salesforce \n\nServerless and Eventing are two ultra-popular areas of tech right now, describing a broad set of ideas and capabilities that can service a range of possible systems. We are told that these concepts will expand and help define the next generation of web services.  That’s all well and good, but what is really going on inside these systems? What technology do those terms rely on and what does an Eventing workflow look like under the hood? Given the complexity and size of these projects’ codebases, it can be difficult to drill down and see what’s happening on a micro scale.  Together, we will discuss, operate and modify a running distributed system built with CloudEvents and Knative Eventing. The system will be based around the concept of an automated conversation between kubernetes services. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UaVh"
