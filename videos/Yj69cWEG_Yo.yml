title: 'SQL Development Made Easy with Docker - Install SQL in 5 minutes or less!'
language: English
recordingDate: 1560772806
description: "C# and Microsoft SQL were made for each other. Where you find one, you often find the other. However, as a developer, getting a full copy of SQL Server on your development machine can be tricky. Or at least, that used to be the case. \n\nIn this video, I am going to show you how to get SQL up and running on your development machine in about five minutes using Docker. \n\nBut we aren't going to stop there. Maybe you have SQL backups running either personally or at your company. How do you know they work? The only way you can be sure they work is to test them. \n\nWe will create an automated script to install SQL, restore the backup, and even sanitize the data if desired. \n\nWith these tools, you can make working with SQL Server quick, simple, and automated. I bet those aren't words you normally associate with SQL Server.\n\nGetting Started with Docker course: https://www.iamtimcorey.com/p/getting-started-with-docker\nVideo Resources: https://1drv.ms/u/s!At1NLb9LVKy4iIYmyUgETPTbV3OHLQ\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/IAmTimCorey\nNewsletter signup (with exclusive discounts, giveaways, and more):  https://signup.iamtimcorey.com/"
