We will also show you how we extended Template 10 to have a service-oriented architecture and dependency injection in UWP apps.\n\nKey takeaways\nSee how Template 10 can help you creating great UWP applications.\nHaving the same codebase\nAlso learn how we did extend Template10 to have a service-oriented architecture and dependency injection in UWP apps.\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
