title: 'Impact of Technical Bias on design decisions - Vincent Nikkelen'
recordingDate: 1534427178
description: "Being biased is a natural concept; in nature one needs to decide fast if one is safe or in danger and need to run away. The act of judging on preliminary, incomplete or assumed information is part of our genes.\n\nBias is often the hardest issue to tackle in technical discussions; being it a 5 line algorithm or a complete distributed architecture. So let's focus on the most frequent ones:\n\n- Anchoring, which means to rely on the first piece of information encountered when making decisions.\n\n- Apophenia, the human tendency to perceive meaningful patterns within random data.\n\n- Confirmation bias, which is the tendency to search for or interpret information in a way that confirms one's beliefs.\n\n- First Solution bias. Tendency to favor the first solution.\n\n- Normalcy bias. \n\nDuring the session, we describe the 5 biases, discuss the impact they have on design and give tips on how to detect and prevent them from happening.\n\nAfter studying Parallel Computing in Eindhoven and Budapest, Vincent Nikkelen worked for Ericsson in Hungary where he held key architectural positions within development for MSC (Mobility Management), AXD-301 and TSP-Dicos; a scalable high-availability platform with a distributed database. In 2008, he moved with his family to Sweden where he lead projects developing new platforms for Ericsson Mobile Platforms. He currently works for Verisure Securitas Direct, the largest alarm operator in Europe. He is one of the driving forces in the activities to break down their monolith into microservices.\n__________________________\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry.
