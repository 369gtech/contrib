title: '[Uber Open Source] Leveraging Pinot at Uber for Large-scale Analytics'
language: English
recordingDate: 1589557126
description: "Apache Pinot is a distributed columnar database for real-time analytics. It powers many well-known applications, including LinkedInâ€™s Who Viewed My Profile feature and Uber Eats timely analytics. Since Pinot joined Apache Incubator in 2019, it has gained a lot of momentum with a growing community. \n\nDuring this May 2020 Uber Engineering Meetup, software engineers Haibo Wang and James Shao discuss how Pinot empowers timely analytics at Uber. We will also dive into how we built an open source Presto connector to enable complex SQL queries on Pinot and other data sources, as well as how we developed upserts for Pinot to allow mutable data in real-time tables.\n\nLearn more: https://eng.uber.com/engineering-sql-support-on-apache-pinot/"
