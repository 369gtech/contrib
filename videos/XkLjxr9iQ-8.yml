language: English
recordingDate: 1606771370
description: "Visual Studio Code Remote Development allows you to use a container, remote machine, or the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.\n\n-- Develop on the same operating system you deploy to or use larger or more specialized hardware.\n-- Sandbox your development environment to avoid impacting your local machine configuration.\n-- Make it easy for new contributors to get started and keep everyone on a consistent environment.\n-- Use tools or runtimes not available on your local OS or manage multiple versions of them.\n-- Develop your Linux-deployed applications using the Windows Subsystem for Linux.\n-- Access an existing development environment from multiple machines or locations.\n-- Debug an application running somewhere else such as a customer site or in the cloud.\n\nBrigit Murtaugh, a PM with VS Code, will talk through the benefits of remote development workflows and then demonstrate how to set things up using VS Code, WSL, Windows Terminal, a remote desktop machine, and a Virtual Machine (VM). \n\nTopics: \n0:27 What is remote development? What are the benefits?\n1:35 Why is remote development a priority for VS Code?\n3:00  How do I set up a remote dev environment in VS Code?\n4:29 What is SSH? How do I do remote dev work with SSH?\n6:27 Demo: Use SSH to debug on a remote machine and virtual machine.\n18:09 What is WSL? Why is it good for remote dev work with VS Code?\n19:27 Demo: Use WSL to run a Python app in Linux but debug on Windows.\n26:22 What about remote development with Docker containers?\n27:18 Tabs vs Spaces?\n28:50 Where can I learn more?\n\nResources:\n-- Visual Studio Code Remote Development docs: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview?WT.mc_id=windows-c9-niner\n-- Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) docs: https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/wsl?WT.mc_id=windows-c9-niner\n-- Windows Terminal docs: https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/terminal?WT.mc_id=windows-c9-niner\n-- Create an Azure Account (12 months free + $200 credit) https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=windows-c9-niner"
