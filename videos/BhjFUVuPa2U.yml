Alas, when your system is composed of many micro-services, testing becomes more challenging. The straight-forward approach for E2E testing no longer suffices and for integration tests it doesn’t even exist. A better way to test in this kind of an environment would be to work with a test kit of the micro-service you are interacting with. By the end of this talk, you will learn how to create a test-kit that covers your micro-service. Testing this way will grant you a much higher level of confidence, and will portray a more accurate picture of your assumptions vs. reality. Overall it will make any integration between micro-services easier, thus benefit your colleagues and make your company progress faster.\n\n \nMaxim Novak \nFrom Wix\nFull of enthusiasm for innovation, and passionate about the way technology and creativity can provide a solution for complex business problems."
