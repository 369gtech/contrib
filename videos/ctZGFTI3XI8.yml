description: "Recorded at SpringOne Platform 2016.\nSpeaker: Stéphane Maldini\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/reactor-30-a-jvm-foundation-for-java-8-and-reactive-streams\n\nThe apparent simplicity of the publisher/subscriber model as exposed in Reactive-Streams can be deceiving. The relatively fast release cycle for libraries in that space is not a myth, concurrency is hard. To keep out undesired side-effects, most Reactive projects have adopted a vertical approach potentially excluding developers from decision-making around execution model or sometimes language.\n\nWhat if we were able to leave the developer in control, positioning as a robust foundation and making the most of the now industrial standard Java 8 ?\n\nWhat if we hardened this foundation through open-source and research collaboration, with a direct feedback loop from Pivotal engineering ?\n\nIn essence, that's what we aim to achieve with Reactor 2.5. This session is an invitation to explore how the new Reactor design, structure and features can progressively help you go Reactive and show how it plays out in your applications today and tomorrow."
