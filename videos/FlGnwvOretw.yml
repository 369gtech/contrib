title: 'Do You Really Get Class Loaders?'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433261730
description: "Class loaders are at the core of the Java language. Java EE containers, OSGi, NetBeans modules, Tapestry 5, Grails, and many others use class loaders heavily. Yet when something goes wrong, would you know how to solve it? This session takes a tour of the Java class loading mechanism, from both the JVM’s and the developer’s point of view. It looks at typical problems you get with class loading and how to solve them. ClassNoDefError, IncompatibleClassChangeError, LinkageError, and many others are symptoms of specific things going wrong that you can usually find and fix. For each problem, the session presents a hands-on demo with a corresponding solution. It also takes a look at how and why class loaders leak and how can you remedy that.\n\n\nAuthor:\nSimon Maple\nSimon is a Developer Advocate at ZeroTurnaround and founder of the vJUG (virtualJUG), in addition to being an active member of the London Java Community (LJC) organising group and LJC JCP EC committee member.
