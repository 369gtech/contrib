description: "If you are a developer, you shouldn't be surprised about the fact that developers spend more than 24% of their time dealing with their development environments. Imagine having a magic button that instantiates a new development environment for you in seconds, integrated with the same hardware, network, and services that you need in production! This experience is now possible thanks to technologies like Docker and Kubernetes, and the automation provided by the cloud. \n\nAbout:\nPablo Chico de Guzman, Founder & CTO, Okteto Inc\n\nFounder & CTO @oktetohq (YC W19). Docker Community Leader. Cloud Native Development Advocate."
