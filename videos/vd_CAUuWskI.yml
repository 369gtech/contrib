description: "In this session, Marc will walk through the history of hacking and warfare, how it started out, what some of the notable cases were and how it has evolved. As part of examining how it has evolved we will walk through a couple of campaigns, both cyber physical and information warfare campaigns will be looked at. We will consider how they have evolved, what some of their core features are, and why they were so successful. Finally we will look at what is being done to defend against some of these campaigns and look toward the future of cyber defense.\n\n=== \n\nMarc Rogers is the VP of Cybersecurity at Okta. With a career that spans more than twenty years, he has been hacking since the 80’s and is now a well known whitehat who has hacked things like Apple’s TouchID and Tesla’s Model S sport’s car.
