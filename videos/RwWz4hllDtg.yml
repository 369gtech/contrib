description: "Have you ever wrote a successful UI test? How many times did you end up discarding a UI test because it's brittle and unmaintainable? And even if you don't write tests, tell me: do you click/type/click/click/setcookie/click/click while developing your UI?\n\nI'm going to explain you the most important best practices that allow you to master the UI tests hell, sleep at night (because you are sure your project works as expected), test the back-end responses too and completely revolutionize the way you develop your UI!\n\nI'm going to talk about - UI testing best practices - live demos with Cypress - improve your workflow using a UI test framework as your everyday working tool (so it's not only about testing)"
