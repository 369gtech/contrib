description: "Telenovelas are beloved for their over the top drama and intricate plot twists. In this talk, we'll review popular telenovelas to synthesize a typical telenovela arc and use it to train a deep learning model.\n\nWhat would a telenovela script look like as imagined by a neural network? To answer this question, we'll examine three Python deep learning frameworks - Keras, PyTorch, and TensorFlow - to determine the process of translating a telenovela into a neural network and ultimately determine which one will be best for the task at hand. Be prepared for amor, pasiòn, and y el misterioso!\n\nLorena Mesa\nGitHub\n@loooorenanicole\n\nolitical scientist turned coder, Lorena Mesa is a data engineer on GitHub's software intelligence systems team, Director on the Python Software Foundation, and PyLadies Chicago co-organizer. Lorena's time at Obama for America and her subsequent graduate research required her to learn how to transform messy, incomplete data into intelligible analysis on topics like predicting Latinx voter behavior. It's this unique background in research and applied mathematics that drove Lorena to pursue a career in engineering and data science. One part activist, one part Star Wars fanatic, and another part Trekkie, Lorena abides by the motto to \"live long and prosper\"."
