description: "Maintaining great organizational culture is one of the most prominent challenges modern IT companies and Startups face. With exponential growths that some companies go through it is tough sharing the vision, while having motivated and engaged employees. On the other hand, open source projects bring people together, and foster sharing and collaboration. Who wouldn't want their teams to apply that to their daily work?\n\nIn this talk I'll talk about maintaining your organizational culture as an open source project. Setting up the culture bottom-up and having everyone participate is the key for greater acceptance and easier onboarding of new employees.\nWant to update how things are done? Make a commit.\nNot sure if the company would benefit from a change? Ask for peer review.\nReady to make a change? Make a merge request.\nSometimes it is simple as that.\n- Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/stretch\n\nStretch Leadership and Management Conference\nstretchcon.com"
