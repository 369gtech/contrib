description: "\"Spreadsheets: The Ununderstood Dark Matter Of IT\"\n\nhttp://strataconf.com/strataeu2013/public/schedule/detail/31755\n\nSpreadsheets are used extensively in industry: they are the number one tool for financial analysis and are also prevalent in other domains, such as logistics and planning. Their flexibility and immediate feedback make them easy to use for non-programmers. But they are as easy to build, as they are difficult to analyze, maintain and check. Felienne's research aims at developing methods to support spreadsheet users to understand, update and improve spreadsheets. Inspiration was taken from classic software engineering, as this field is specialized in the analysis of data and calculations. In this talk Felienne will summarize her recently completed PhD research on the topic of spreadsheet structure visualization, spreadsheet smells and clone detection, as well as presenting a sneak peek into the future of spreadsheet research as Delft University."
