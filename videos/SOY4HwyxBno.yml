description: "MobileOptimized 2020, Online – November 6-7, 2020\n\nAndroid Automotive. Not Android Auto but a new OS, Fedor Tcymbal\n\nIn this session you will get an overview of the new Android Automotive OS: how is it different from Android Auto and from the standard Android. You will learn about Google Automotive Services, Driver Distraction Guidelines, and integration with different car systems (e.g. rear view camera).\n\nOn developer.android.com there is a single section titled “Android for Cars” that lumps together two rather distinct systems: Android Auto and Android Automotive OS. The naming does not help that much to distinguish them either. So most people and even Android developers don’t really know the difference. In reality however Android Auto was released in 2015 together with Android 5.0, and Android Automotive OS is just going to be released this or next year. So in this session you will get an overview of this new OS: how is it different from Android Auto and from the standard Android OS and what it means to develop for Android Automotive. You will learn about Google Automotive Services, Driver Distraction Guidelines, Garage Mode and integration with different car systems – like rear view camera, for example."
