description: "Наша группа в ФБ: https://www.facebook.com/dotnetfest/\nНаш сайт: www.dotnetfest.com\n\nДоклад на конференции .NET Fest 2017 в Киеве.\nIn object-oriented design, dependency injection is a well-known design pattern, although it's a complicated solution to the problem of decoupling. Functional programming offers a simpler way. This talk examines dependency injection in object-oriented design, and explains how it's not required (nor desired) in functional programming. You don't need to know Haskell or F# to attend this session; relevant syntax will be explained just-in-time. Object-oriented examples will be in C#."
