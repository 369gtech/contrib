The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nBuilding K8s on AWS and Enabling Developers to Deliver. What to Do Better - Greg Sansom, Zip & Fahad Tariq, CMD \n\nZip’s been on a journey of discovery, migration and adoption and meeting strict demands. This is the journey Greg Sansom and Fahad Tariq would like to share with you. An infrastructure team usually has brilliant ideas on how development should happen. So engineers plan and they build and they usually get eighty percent right. This talk is about the twenty they don’t, and why.\n\nThe company recently took advantage of an opportunity to develop a brand new platform with aim of vastly improving deployment capabilities. With the help of a partner, 143 git repositories, 16000 commits from 54 people, there’s been a few lessons learnt. Having developers involved from the start and deploying to the environments meant fast feedback, a reorganisation of priorities and occasionally, a validation or two.\n\nThis talk is about the challenges faced, compromises made, promises kept and lessons learned."
