description: "Held on September 20 2018\n\nWatch Joel Kallman, Senior Director of Software Development, along with a number of experts from the global APEX Community, to discuss Oracle Forms Modernization.  Learn about the positive aspects, together with the challenges, of using Oracle APEX to modernize your Oracle Forms applications.  Real-world success stories, challenges, and tips are presented.  \n\nSession Chats: https://apex.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=20051:4:1757390683715::NO::P4_ASKTOM_OFFICE_HOUR_ID:157276294837434079139335725983223048710\n\nKey Video Timestamps:\n\nPanel Introduction [9:15]\nQuestion 1 [11:55] - Can you please give a brief overview of one of your completed projects (or something which is underway)?\nQuestion 2 [20:50] - What would you say is your approach in modernization with APEX? Rewrite? Partial migration? Create new apps adjacent to the existing Oracle Forms apps?\n\nQuestion 3 [29:40] - What were some of the biggest challenges you faced in this type of project?\n\nQuestion 4 [36:15] - What was the biggest benefit to the customer? Has the customer been satisfied with the result?\n\nQuestion 5 [41:50] - We always talk about preserving your investment in the back-end business logic, in SQL and PL/SQL. Is this a fallacy? How much of the back-end code had to be modified to work in the new world with APEX?\nQuestion 6 [46:30] - Can you describe the process you follow to assess if something is appropriate to be modernized with APEX? Can you give an example of something you would not use APEX to modernize a Forms app?\n\nQuestion 7 [50:55] - How do you go about educating someone to use APEX, who comes from a Forms background? It is Web, and Web is different.\nQuestion 8 [1:01:45] - How long does it take for the existing Forms developers to become competent in APEX and Web development? Were they able to carry on with further development on their own?\n\nQuestion 9 [1:04:35] - Can customers do this migration on their own? This Office Hours forum is comprised of our many partners, and if I were watching this, I might think “wow, I need outside help to get this done”. What would you say?\nQuestion 10 [1:08:40] - For anyone watching this, who is contemplating modernizing some fo their Forms apps with APEX, do you have any specific advice?\n\nAskTOM Office Hours offers free, monthly training and tips on how to make the most of Oracle Database, from Oracle product managers, developers and evangelists.\n\nhttps://asktom.oracle.com/\n\nOracle Developers portal: https://developer.oracle.com/\nSign up for an Oracle Cloud trial: https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/tryit\n\n\nmusic: bensound.com"
