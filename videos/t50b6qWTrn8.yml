description: 'Codemotion Milan 2015 - "UX for Developers, Seriously!" by Agnieszka Naplocha - User Experience is becoming more and more crucial aspect while creating new applications. It aims to make life easier for the users, but at the same time is a huge pain for developers. I''ll help you explain why it is so important and show the most useful tools and techniques you can use without design background. With the set of simple tools, developers can easily validate their ideas and find a way to develop better projects (especially when there are not UX Designers in the team). UX skillset among developers is really appreciated, so why not to try?'
