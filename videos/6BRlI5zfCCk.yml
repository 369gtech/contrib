description: "Recording brought to you by American Express. https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs\nJetpack Compose is an ambitious multi-team effort to reimagine Android's UI Toolkit more than 10 years after the Android Platform launched with the original UI Toolkit.\n\nCompose follows a declarative programming model, and the runtime is coupled with a Kotlin compiler plugin to enable a novel new approach to declarative programming.\n\nIn this talk, Leland will go over the mechanics of how the Compose runtime and compiler plugin work together, demystifying how it can be used to enable efficient and performant user interfaces.\n\nIn addition, this talk will describe how Compose can operate completely independent of the Android Platform and Compose UI, allowing it to be used as a general language feature for Incremental Computing and the management of tree-like data structures.\n\nResources:\nKotlinConf website: https://jb.gg/fyaze5\nKotlinConf on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlinconf\n\nKotlin website: https://jb.gg/pxrsn6\nKotlin blog: https://jb.gg/7uc7ow\nKotlin on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlin\n\n#KotlinConf19 #Kotlin #JetBrains\n\nAbout the Presenter:\nLeland Richardson is a Software Engineer at Google working on the Android UI Toolkit. In particular, Leland has been working on the compiler, runtime, and design of Jetpack Compose, the new declarative UI Toolkit and runtime unveiled at Google I/O."
