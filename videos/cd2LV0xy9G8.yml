description: "In this video from the Northeast Scala Symposium, Daniel Spiewak is going to talk about ENSIME. \r\n\r\nMost people have heard of ENSIME by now as the go-to mode for Scala editing in Emacs.  This alone is quite awesome, but what you may *not* know is that ENSIME itself is entirely editor agnostic!  This talk will briefly cover ENSIME, what it offers, how it works, how we talk to it, and what it means for you."
