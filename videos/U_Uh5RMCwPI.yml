description: "Continuous Chaos in DevOps\n\nGnani Daththreya, Director, Enterprise Architecture, Capital One \nSathiya Shunmugasundaram, Lead Software Engineer, Technology Operations, Capital One \n\nDevOps has brought cultural change in the delivery of software and Cloud is a big enabler of DevOps. Cloud is ubiquitous, however failures are unavoidable and unpredictable raising uncertainty and are risk to the systems. Adding continuous chaos to DevOps culture helps building anti fragile applications in Cloud. Traditional approaches can’t predict all failure modes. Chaos engineering is a discipline to simulate these failures. In our Cloud Detour solution, we describe how mission critical applications using compute/storage and other services in the cloud can register themselves in an automated way to test against several failure scenarios and demonstrate their resiliency level. Cloud Detour itself is management free with Serverless implementation and can be integrated with application CICD pipelines.\n\nDOES17 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
