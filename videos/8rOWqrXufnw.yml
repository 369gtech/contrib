description: "LISA16 - Catch Fire and Halt: Fire in the Datacenter\n\nJon Kuroda, University of California, Berkeley\n\nWhat do you do when you have a fire in the datacenter that takes your entire organization down until you can recover? Well, we found out the hard way when, on Friday, September 18, 2015, one of our research groupâ€™s servers caught fire at the UC Berkeley campus datacenter, thus activating the facility fire suppression and emergency power-off systems and causing the outage of nearly all campus-hosted online services with recovery efforts lasting through the weekend. We will detail the circumstances surrounding the incident itself, examine the post-mortem process that followed the incident, and compare our experiences with those of other engineering disciplines after the occurrence of a critical incident.\n\nView the full LISA16 Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa16/conference-program"
