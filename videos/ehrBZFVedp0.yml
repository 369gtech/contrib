description: "DOES19 Las Vegas — Welcome to the software economy, where developers unleash disruptive innovation at an unprecedented rate. If you are a non-trivial software business (and pretty much every non-trivial business is) then guess what? You’re now competing with every other software business in the world.\n\nResearch tells us that organizations that successfully implement DevOps practices and efficient CI/CD pipelines are able to deploy faster, fail less frequently and recover more quickly from downtime. (source: DORA 2018).\n\nIn this talk, Anders will discuss 3 key things organizations should consider as they work to connect their software development efforts to the rest of the business and allow the organization to achieve a harmonious state of “Continuous Everything.”\n\nDOES19 Las Vegas\nDOES 2019 US\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
