FP enthusiast powered by tons of coffee. Blessed to work with Scala on production at AVSystem, building software for the telecommunications industry.\n\nJakub Bujas\nA fifth year computer science student at AGH University of Science and Technology. Surfer between many IT domains: web-dev, functional programming, data-science and game-dev. Cannot imagine life without reading books and watching good movies. Currently, he is a game developer at Empyrean Games Studio.\n\nScala(ble) High-Performance Computing\n\nParallel implementation of complex, data-intensive, synchronized computation poses a significant challenge. Akka as a toolkit for building highly concurrent, distributed, message-driven applications is already battle-proven, yet it is not popular within the field of scientific computing. Our framework for biological habitat simulation in Scala leverages Akka Actors for parallelization and the Akka Cluster distribution mechanisms for cluster management. Conducted experiments prove linear scalability of the method up to 53568 computing cores and we are yet to find its limits."
