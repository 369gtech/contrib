description: "In a monolithic application, different services are developed within same project side by side.\n\nIn these kind of applications you don't need to worry about breaking the compatibility between contract interfaces since there is an invisible verifier called compiler that checks that all method calls follows the defined signature.\n\nBut in case of microservices, different services are deployed in different runtimes and using different separated networks.\n\nIn this scenario, any change on the contract of one service cannot be caught by the compiler since there is no typesafe connection between services..\n\nNow breaking the compatibility between services can be really easy and hard to detect (maybe until your new version of the service is on production).\n\nIn this talk we are going to explore why deploying a new version of a service might break everything in microservices architecture, and how to fix with consumer-driven contracts pattern.\n\nAlex Soto is a software engineer at Red Hat. He is a passionate of Java world, software automation and he believes in the open source software model.\n\nAlex is the creator of NoSQLUnit project. He is a member of JSR374 (Java API for JSON Processing) Expert Group. Currently Alex is co-writing Testing Java Microservices book for Manning and he is an international speaker presenting his talks at software conferences like Devoxx, JavaOne, JavaZone or JavaLand."
