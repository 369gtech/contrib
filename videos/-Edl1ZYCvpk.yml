language: English
recordingDate: 1632327132
description: "A global automotive company engaged Deloitte for their Finance and Direct Procurement Business Process Transformation with a common data model to enable innovation and accelerate sustained fitness. \n \n The program scope was outlined across four dimensions—geographic, business process, application, and data—to provide a comprehensive view of manufacturing and finance data that will be refined through the explore phase. Deloitte built an API-based integration platform connecting Legacy Applications to the S4 Hana platform using a microservices-based architecture deployed via VMware Tanzu Application Service. \n \n The integration platform currently supports ~92 source systems using bespoke protocols of SOAP, REST API, Message Queues, File-Based, and Database. The platform handles high-volume transactions with a max of 10M records per day. Microservices are built for more than 20 different business units and designed for optimal usage of computing, storage, and network resources.\n\nManoj Thekumpurath, Sr. Manager at Deloitte\nSiddharth Mehrotra, Senior Manager at Deloitte\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/vmware-tanzu-application-service-as-an-integration-platform"
