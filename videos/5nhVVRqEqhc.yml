title: 'Design Systems Aren’t Hard (But They Are Complex)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1617206403
description: "Design systems are often thought of in terms of the visible parts - a Sketch file, a repository of React code, a documentation website. But these are only the artifacts of the system. A design system is actually the thinking and the decision making and the principles of your organization. Producing the artifacts is the easy part - maintaining the institutional value of the design system is the hard part.\n\n\nIn this talk we’ll dive into the lessons I’ve learned during my time working on a large design system for a fast growing company. Hopefully we can help you avoid some of the common pitfalls and enjoy the quiet satisfaction of working on a design system so successful no one ever thinks twice about it. \n\n\n***\n\nZeet helps anyone deploy and scale like the top tech companies, without the work.
