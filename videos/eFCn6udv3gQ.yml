description: "Get the Code Here: http://goo.gl/Lx2uv\n\nWelcome to my Java Heap Tutorial. In previous tutorials, I covered how to print out trees in Java. You may want to look at that before continuing here, but it isn't required.\n\nA Heap is kind of like a tree, but it is normally implemented as an array. There are 2 main rules for using a heap. 1. Every row is complete except for last row. 2. Parent keys are bigger then children. I will cover how to insert and remove items. I'll show how an array is heaped. I'll also cover how the Heap Sort works. Everything is covered in the video and code."
