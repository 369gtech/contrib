title: 'Neural Networks: Walkthrough by Katharine Beaumont'
language: English
recordingDate: 1510048484
description: "You pick up the keyboard, and select 'tanh'. 'Play'. The epochs rack up... Something doesn't feel right, things aren't converging, your HP is decreasing. But you've seen people do this before... The FAQ is useless, and the documentation is like boss level 99. You know it's possible - but What The Fowler is 'tanh' anyway? And How The Fortran does this work?\n\nNeural Networks are hard. But don't worry, there is a walkthrough for this, and it has pictures.\n\n# Katharine Beaumont\nKatharine is a Java developer, having worked on medical software, Big Data and complex event processing, web development and machine learning. She has given a number of conference talks on her experiences in the software industry. With a background in law, science, mathematics and more recently machine learning, she (unsurprisingly) loves learning! Having worked as the Community & Content Manager for Voxxed, she is now taking a Computer Science Masters with a focus on AI and Machine Learning. On the side, she is freelance/a Pluralsight author, enjoys playing with Matlab/Python/Ruby, cycling and living on a farm."
