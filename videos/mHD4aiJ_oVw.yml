description: "Sven Reimers, System Engineer, Airbus Defence and Space\n\nWith Java Flight Recorder (JFR) and Java Mission Control (JMC) now being open-sourced and usable for free by everyone, it is time to investigate uses besides the standard full-blown JMC client application. This session introduces you to three ways you can access and visualize JFR data: (1) from the console, which is interesting for all those microservices people who love terminal windows; (2) from within a simple standalone JavaFX application, for all those UI people; and (3) as a plugin for your favorite IDE. All examples are shown with live code and slides to explain the main points."
