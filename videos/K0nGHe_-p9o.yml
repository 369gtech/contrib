title: '"A Panel on a symbiosis between Civic Hacking and Perl Evangelism"'
language: English
recordingDate: 1498272980
description: 'This fairly meta talk discusses a bubbling practice of civic engagement, or ''civic hacking'' to solve local problems that local government or local business neglect. It may also help solve a problem Perl has been facing, as a community, and that''s in encouraging new blood to join our ranks... to ensure there''s demand for perl developers in our ecosystem. A small panel, well-represented by community members and USPTO staff, all participants in the local ''CodeForAmerica'' chapter ''CodeForNoVA'', will discuss the issue and invite conversation from the room.'
