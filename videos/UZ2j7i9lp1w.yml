title: 'JDK IO 2017 - Jesper Wermuth - DevOps As Code - A War Story'
recordingDate: 1510512575
description: 'This is a talk about how and why we codified and automated an entire infrastructure at Danske Spil, including server generation, networking, access, infrastructure building and deployment, code project building and deployment, generation of CI environment and much more. We even codified the workflows of the DevOps department, a very interesting part of the project that I look forward to share. The talk has a technical angle and there will be high level views and code examples and perhaps a demo if I feel lucky that day. Some of the technologies / things involved are: terraform, packer, vagrant, AWS, jenkins, gradle, VPNs, NATs, Virtual Private Clouds, IAM, Java, Artifactory, Docker, Swarm, Registry, â€¦ Hope to see you there 8)'
