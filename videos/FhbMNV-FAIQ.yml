See http://fitc.ca for details.\n\nOverview\nThe web is fundamentally broken in two deeply profound ways and unfortunately the only way we’re going to move forward is to painfully break from our past and present realities. First, we’ve got to break from the idealistic but untenable notion of unbounded backwards compatibility.

Let’s stop building a broken Web and break it forward.\n\nKyle Simpson\nOpen Web Evangelist, Getify Solutions\nhttps://twitter.com/getify\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
