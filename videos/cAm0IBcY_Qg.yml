title: 'YOW! 2014 Aino Vonge Corry - Retrospective Antipatterns'
recordingDate: 1514469493
description: "Anti-Patterns are like patterns, only more informative. With anti-patterns you will first see what patterns reoccur in “bad” retrospectives and then you will see how to avoid, or remedy, the situation.\n\nBased on my experience with facilitating retrospectives, join me for an entertaining and informative presentation on the anti-patterns I have seen and how to overcome the problems. I also encourage the audience to chip-in with their experiences or questions along the way.\n\nAino Corry is a teacher, a technical conference editor and retrospectives facilitator. She holds a masters degree and a ph.d. in computer science. She has 12 years of experience with Patterns in Software Development, and teaches OO design, software architecture and development in academia and industry. She also teaches how to teach Computer Science to teachers, and thus lives up to the name of her company; Metadeveloper. In her spare time, she runs and sings (but not at the same time).\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
