description: "JFuture 2019, Minsk â€“ November 16, 2019\n\nPurely Dysfunctional Data Structures in Java, Grzegorz Piwowarek\n\nThe design of performant immutable data structures is a challenge that was accepted by Chris Okasaki over 20 years ago.\n\nIn this talk, we'll explore what the concept of Persistent Data Structures is, how are they implemented, and how much blood, sweat, and tears need to be done on the other side to make the experience of working with immutable data structures efficient."
