description: "Wormhole: Reliable Pub-Sub to Support Geo-replicated Internet Services\n\nYogeshwer Sharma, Philippe Ajoux, Petchean Ang, David Callies, Abhishek Choudhary, Laurent Demailly, Thomas Fersch, Liat Atsmon Guz, Andrzej Kotulski, Sachin Kulkarni, Sanjeev Kumar, Harry Li, Jun Li, Evgeniy Makeev, and Kowshik Prakasam, Facebook; Robbert van Renesse, Cornell University; Sabyasachi Roy, Pratyush Seth, Yee Jiun Song, Benjamin Wester, Kaushik Veeraraghavan, and Peter Xie, Facebook\n\nWormhole is a publish-subscribe (pub-sub) system developed for use within Facebookâ€™s geographically replicated datacenters. It is used to reliably replicate changes among several Facebook services including TAO, Graph Search and Memcache. This paper describes the design and implementation of Wormhole as well as the operational challenges of scaling the system to support the multiple data storage systems deployed at Facebook. Our production deployment of Wormhole transfers over 35 GBytes/sec in steady state (50 millions messages/sec or 5 trillion messages/day) across all deployments with bursts up to 200 GBytes/sec during failure recovery. We demonstrate that Wormhole publishes updates with low latency to subscribers that can fail or consume updates at varying rates, without compromising efficiency.\n\nView the full NSDI '15 Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi15/technical-sessions"
