description: "This presentation will introduce a new start-up focused on machine learning that is using Clojure. We will discuss the technology and architecture it has developed for real-time machine learning and pattern recognition, and how Clojure provides a unique set of advantages.\n\nThere will be a live coding demonstration of interactively applying machine learning to a simple task and visualization of the results."
