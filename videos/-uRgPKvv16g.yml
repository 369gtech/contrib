description: "Full title: Everywhere commerce –voice interfaces, autonomous warehouses, self-driving delivery - Daniel Gebler - Codemotion Amsterdam 2018\n\nIn this keynote we will show how a unique combination of IoT, AI, Drones and autonomous vehicles is forming the next generation of commerce. From mobile to voice interfaces, from manual to autonomous warehouses, from human operated to self-driving cars. The technology is there, pilots are in operation, and broad adoption is not far away. We will show how Picnic and other retailers are building logistic platforms that unlock the next generation of commerce experience."
