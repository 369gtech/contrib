title: 'Will Planned Obsolescence Kill Silicon Valley? - Rob Coneybeer'
recordingDate: 1435432492
description: "From Solid Conference 2015: In Detroit’s heyday, automotive manufacturers built generations of vehicles with intentionally limited lifespans to encourage new vehicle purchases on a regular basis. In today’s world of connected hardware, leading vendors like Apple are pursuing similar strategies based on rapid obsolescence.\n\nWhat’s different this time is the role of Moore’s Law and software – rapid innovations in faster wireless protocols, higher power processors, lower power budgets and better battery lives are forcing consumers, designers and businesses to view hardware as a service rather than merely as products. However, unlike the decisions that eventually led to Detroit’s downfall, planned obsolescence is a good thing for both consumers and hardware vendors alike. This talk will explore how designers can create products that ease rapid transitions from generation to generation of product, and how businesses can benefit from planned obsolesence while still delighting their customers.\n\nAbout Rob Coneybeer (Shasta Ventures):\nRob Coneybeer is a veteran venture capitalist who approaches start-up investing from a product perspective.
