description: 'Arquillian is a revolutionary testing platform for Java and the JVM that enables developers to easily create and execute integration and functional tests for Java middleware, from Java EE and beyond. One of Arquillian''s strong points is its extensibility. Arquillian was built with the ability to change its default behavior via its powerful extension model as well as to grow past its original programming to take on the challenges of tomorrow. This presentation guides you through the Arquillian extensions by demonstrating how specific extensions solve common problematic testing scenarios faced by enterprise developers. You will get a overview of what is available and possible today as well as what is brewing in the community.'
