description: 'At Springest, the leading marketplace for Learning, we do OKR-driven development. We''ve worked the Objectives & Key Results framework seamlessly into Holacracy. Holacracy is the self-management practice for running purpose-driven companies, on which we have been scaling for over 5 years. I show how Springest''s purpose –"Helping people reach their full potential through learning"– trickles down to the Product Development circle, how it helps us adapt strategy, and how it perpetually forces us developers and product owners to think about the "why?" and the "why now?" of any project we undertake.'
