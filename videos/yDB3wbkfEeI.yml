description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Oslo 2020. #GOTOcon #GOTOoslo\nhttps://goto-oslo.com\r\n\r\nDylan Beattie - Creator of the Rockstar programming language and Microsoft MVP (and a real life rockstar, too)\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\nSoftware and technology have changed every aspect of the world we live in. At one extreme are the ‘mission critical’ applications - the code that runs our banks, our hospitals, our airports and phone networks. Then there’s the code we all use every day to browse the web, watch movies, create spreadsheets… not quite so critical, but still code that solves problems and delivers services.\nBut what about the code that only exists because somebody wanted to write it?\nCode created just to make people smile, laugh, maybe even dance?\nMaybe even code that does nothing at all?\nCode that was created just to see if it was possible?\nJoin Dylan Beattie - programmer, musician, and creator of the Rockstar programming language - for an entertaining look at the art of code. We’ll look at the origins of programming as an art form, from Conway’s Game of Life to fractal geometry and the earliest Obfuscated C competitions. We’ll learn about esoteric languages and quines - how DO you create a program that prints its own source code?\nWe’ll discover quine relays, code golf and generative art, and we’ll explore the phenomenon of live coding as performance, from the pioneers of electronic music to modern algoraves and live coding platforms like Sonic Pi. You'll never look at code [...]\r\n\r\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\r\nhttps://goto-oslo.com/2020/sessions/1248/the-art-of-code-virtual\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcph\r\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\r\n#ArtOfCode #CodeIsArt #SoftwareEngineering #Programming\r\n\r\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\r\nAttend the next GOTO Conference near you!
