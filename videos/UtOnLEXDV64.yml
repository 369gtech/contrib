description: "Reject.JS 2014 – Berlin, September 11, 2014\nSlides: http://de.slideshare.net/johannes-weber/debugging-war-stories-strategies-to-survive-on-rejectjs-2014\n\nImagine you’ve received a bug report from your favourite app. It happened on a complex system and you wouldn’t actually know what each part is doing. In this case, the first defense is trying to reproduce it with enabled DevTools. Either you know how to fix it immediately or you waste a lot of time with solving it without success. Have you ever experienced one of these bugs? Trying to fix them for hours without any result? It sucks and simply wastes too much precious time.\n\nThis talk is going to dive deep into advanced debugging JavaScript apps. We talk about the most powerful strategies and less known techniques in order to be more effective in fixing THE problem.\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
