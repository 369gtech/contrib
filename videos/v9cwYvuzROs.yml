description: "Deep Dive: Virtual Kubelet - Jeremy Rickard, Microsoft & Lei Zhang, Alibaba Cloud \n\nVirtual Kubelet has most recently been accepted into the CNCF as a sandboxed project. As the project continues to grow in contributors and users we are always looking for ways to educate folks on how to contribute back to Virtual Kubelet. In this talk we will focus on the core interface of Virtual Kubelet and how a developer could get started with building his/her first provider! The talk will include an engineer from Alibaba who contributed the Elastic Container Instance provider and a maintainer of Virtual Kubelet, so we have a spectrum of perspectives represented. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPkI"
