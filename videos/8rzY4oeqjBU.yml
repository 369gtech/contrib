description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io\n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nMusic Matched to Different Ways to Scale in K8s, What Could Go Wrong? - Ria Bhatia, Microsoft\n\nThe other week someone asked \"how do I over provision resources so I have them immediately when I need them?\" and I sat there in awe because the community has already come up with a couple options on how to scale on-demand, so why are Kubernetes users still asking for this? That question is the inspiration for this talk. From the operations perspective, I'll discuss what it takes to build up the cluster autoscaler and horizontal pod autoscaler. The talk will incorporate experiments and tests that were run to come up with conclusions on how to appropriately tweak metrics so scaling is cost-effective and efficient. The truth is, most scaling within Kubernetes is metrics based so I'll also take a look at the ecosystem to see if there are other possible methods of scaling. The goal is to teach operation folks of Kubernetes on what it takes to effectively scale with help from some pop music.\n\nTo learn more click here: https://sched.co/FuKG"
