description: "Ближайшая конференция — DotNext 2020 Moscow\n2-5 декабря, Online\nПодробности и билеты: https://dotnext-moscow.ru/\n\n. Ближайшая конференция — DotNext\_2020 Piter\n15-18 июня, Online\nПодробности и билеты: https://bit.ly/dotnext2020piter\n\n. In this talk we'll explore techniques and code patterns for creating a high performance code, from analysis to actual optimization. We will explain how to recognize when optimizations are needed, where the bottlenecks typically are and the code patterns that arise on database engine code optimization. Many of the techniques explored in the talk have been learned or perfected while working on RavenDB 4.0, the latest version of the leading NoSQL engine for .NET. In RavenDB, we have worked hard to optimize up to the nanosecond level all the tight code-paths, with improvements over several metrics, including memory, IO and CPU consumption. Most of the optimization patterns can be applied to high performance software regardless of the language or frameworks used."
