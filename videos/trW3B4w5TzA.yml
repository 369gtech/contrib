description: "Thanks to our Community Sponsors: Honeycomb.io and CircleCI.com\n\nSpeakers: Kathleen Vignos (Director, Infrastructure Automation, Platform Engineering, Twitter), Chris Alden (Group Technology Director, Work & Co), Adrian Cruz (Senior Engineer, Glossier), Ale Paredes (VP Engineering, Code Climate).\n\nIn this session, we’ve assembled a group of engineering leaders who have had their working life affected by coronavirus. Attendees will have the opportunity to pre-submit questions to the panel to understand how this has changed the way they’re working, how they recommend making the switch, and how to mitigate the tensions that will initially occur."
