description: "Welcome to Data Lit! This 3 month course is an intro to data science for beginners. In this video, i'll explain how a popular data science technique called sentiment analysis works using a real-world scenario. We'll play the role of a data scientist working at a startup making a personal healthcare device. Using sentiment analysis, we'll understand how consumers feel about a competitors product. That'll help us make decisions on how to promote our own product, and what feature we can focus on the most. Using Python, Twitter, and Google Colab, anyone can do this process in just a few minutes.
