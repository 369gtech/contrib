description: "Want to see a preview of ServerlessDays Paris ? Join us live on Youtube September 21st at 7:30 PM CEST with Rob Sutter, Head of Developer Advocacy at Fauna for this ServerlessDays Warmup session. It includes Rob's 30-min talk \"Lambda is dead; long live serverless!\" and will be followed by a 30-min discussion panel.\n\nThere’s no question that AWS Lambda transformed computing. However, as it attempts to become a general purpose compute solution, is it on a path to becoming a legacy option?\nIn this talk, you'll learn how Lambda’s generalization has opened a space for more specialized options to emerge. We'll explore the three modern use cases for compute, and the next generation, more specialized serverless solutions that are better suited for each use case. Finally,we'll sort what’s available today from the work that’s left to be done.\nThis talk is for developers at all levels interested in the future of serverless computing. Attendees should be familiar with the basic ideas behind serverless computing, and a little knowledge of military aviation and the OODA loop wouldn’t hurt.\n\nRob has woven application development into his entire career, from time in the U.S. Army and U.S. Government to stints with the Big Four and Amazon Web Services. He has started his own company – twice – once providing consulting services and most recently with WorkFone, a SaaS startup providing virtual digital identities. Rob loves to build in public with cloud architectures, Node.js or Go, and all things serverless!\n\nThe in-person ServerlessDays Paris one-day event will take place in Cité Universitaire on September 28th.
