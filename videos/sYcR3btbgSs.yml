title: 'Dmitry Soshnikov - Science Art in the Cloud: How I built a Museum Exhibit'
language: English
recordingDate: 1620120761
description: "In this talk, I will share my personal story of building a museum exhibit, which has been demonstrated in Electromuseum in Moscow and later on converted to online. It is based on a science-art technique called Cognitive Portrait, where we take a number of photographs of different people and blend them together in such a way that eyes are exactly in the same position. The Exhibit photographs all passers-by in a gallery and creates the blended portrait of a visitor.\n\nThrough the power of the cloud, it can also blend together people who are physically in different galleries, or even at their homes. I will demonstrate how different Azure components helped me create and refine the project: we will meet Codespaces, VS Code Notebooks, Azure Functions, UWP Applications, Azure Web Apps, and Bot Framework.\n\nYou can try the online version of the exhibit yourself at http://eazify.net/peopleblend"
