description: "RubyConfBY 2019 - https://rubyconference.by\n\nVideo Partner â€“ iTechArt  https://www.itechart.by \n\nAbout the talk: \nAWS released official Ruby Support for Lambda at re:Invent 2018. This announcement makes Ruby a first-class citizen in the Serverless world. The framework that will be discussed was already been running Ruby at Native speed prior to the announcement. The framework switched over to the official AWS version of Ruby less than 2 weeks after the announcement! \n\nWe will do a quick introduction to the Serverless world and AWS Lambda to establish a baseline for everyone. Then we'll jump into a Ruby Framework that makes Serverless easy to work with. \n\nRuby is the not only one of most beautiful languages in the world but also extremely powerful. The power lies in Ruby's Metaprogramming abilities. This serverless framework leverages these Ruby powers to create a DSL that essentially translates Ruby code to AWS Lambda functions. We'll introduce these Framework concepts: \n-Controllers\n-Routes\n-Jobs\nWe will create a few demos and deploy it to AWS Lambda live. We will also cover some architecture pattern examples that can be built with the framework: \nWeb API Application\nEvent Driven Security: Auto-Remediation\nContinuous Compliance: AWS Config Rules\nEvent Driven IoT Architectures\nServerless Ruby opens a world of possibilities for Ruby programmers."
