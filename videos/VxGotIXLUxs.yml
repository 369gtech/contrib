language: English
recordingDate: 1573074703
description: "The amount of data the world produces is growing exponentially every year and many companies are realising the potential of harnessing this data. A lot of this is generated in the form of a never ending stream of events, with publishers creating the events and subscribers consuming them in many different ways. This is where Apache Kafka comes in, Kafka isn't just a messaging system - it's an event streaming platform.\n\nThis session will introduce Kafka and explain concepts such as topic partitioning, consumer groups and exactly-once semantics.\n\nThis session will give you the knowledge you need to start your journey with the event streaming platform that everyone is talking about.\n\nKatherine Stanley is a Software Engineer in the IBM Event Streams team based in the UK. Through her work on IBM Event Streams she has gained experience running Apache Kafka on Kubernetes and running enterprise Kafka applications. In her previous role she specialised in cloud native Java applications and microservices architectures. Katherine has co-authored an IBM Redbook on Java microservices and has contributed to the open source microservice project Game On. She enjoys sharing her experiences and has presented at conferences around the world, including the Kafka Summits in New York and London, JavaLand in Germany and JFokus in Sweden."
