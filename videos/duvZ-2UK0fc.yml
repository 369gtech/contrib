title: 'Ned Batchelder - Big-O: How Code Slows as Data Grows - PyCon 2018'
recordingDate: 1526253586
description: "Speaker: Ned Batchelder\n\nBig-O is a computer science technique for analyzing how code performs as data gets larger.  It's a very handy tool for the working programmer, but it's often shrouded in off-putting mathematics.\n\nIn this talk, I'll teach you what you need to know about Big-O, and how to use it to keep your programs running well.  Big-O helps you choose the data structures and algorithms that will let your code work efficiently even on large data sets.\n\nYou can understand Big-O even if you aren't a theoretical computer science math nerd. Big-O isn't as mystical as it appears. It's wrapped in mathematical trappings, but doesn't have to be more than a common-sense assessment of how your code will behave.\n\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2018 and https://github.com/PyCon/2018-slides"
