description: "Do you want to know what the next exciting JS features that you don’t even know you need? So, let me show you four proposals that may change the way you write code as spread operator did. These features are:\n\n- Array.prototype.flatMap\n- Pipeline operator\n- Partial application\n- Bind operator ::\n\nAfter showing the usage of these features I’d like to invite you to help TC39 push these features forward and to contribute with proposals that you’d like to see implemented in Javascript."
