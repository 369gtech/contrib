title: 'Voice Applications (Alexa Skills) Cloud Native on Kubernetes with Terraform'
language: English
recordingDate: 1632327349
description: "Since 2011, voice assistants have been entering our lives little by little. It wasn't until 2014 that Amazon created the Echo devices with its built-in assistant, Alexa. In 2018, they gave us the opportunity for anyone to add functionality through skills: the means to be able to create voice-based applications for the first time.\n \n What are we going to talk about?\n \n In this talk, a totally pioneering architecture in this type of application will be taught: How to deploy an Alexa Skill in Kubernetes environments, from local development with Kind and DevSpace to the design of a Helm chart of the Alexa Skill itself, together with the nonrelational database MongoDB, to automatic deployment in AKS with Terraform.\n \n What will this bring to attendees?\n \n The main goal of this talk—in addition to learning how to develop an Alexa Skill—is to teach attendees the different ways to develop and deploy an Alexa Skill. We'll investigate all the different types of deployments supported for these voice apps.\n\nXavier Portilla Edo, Infrastructure Engineer at Voiceflow\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/voice-applications-alexa-skills-cloud-native-on-kubernetes-with-terraform"
