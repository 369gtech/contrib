description: "The talk from .NET Fest conference in Kyiv, Ukraine.\nPresentation: http://bit.ly/2Nnq4nC\nFb: https://www.facebook.com/dotNETFest/\nWebsite: http://dotnetfest.com/\n\n\nIoT is not the future anymore. It is happening right here and right now. There are more and more applications for deploying tiny electronic devices and companies are starting to see the value in this approach. To meet the high demand for IoT solutions, Microsoft invested 5 BILLION dollars in their IoT services last year.\nDeveloping and deploying IoT code using Azure services is easy. The hard part is supporting the large amount of data that comes with it. By using the classic approach for developing backend services, scalability, maintenance, deployment and deciding frameworks are the biggest nightmares any architect will face.\nServerless computing comes to solve these issues and allows us to focus on what matters most â€“ the logic. In this session we will discuss the differences between the classic backend approach and the new serverless approach. We will go over the services that Azure provides us for IoT development and how we can connect them to other services on Azure to create a completely serverless system, which will save us development and maintenance time."
