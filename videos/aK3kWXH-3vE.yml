description: "The Blue Team Village is proud to introduce the Meet-a-Mentor program. Come meet the Core Mentors and learn how you can take part of the program as either mentor or mentee.\n\nThe Meet-a-Mentor program seeks to bring together mentors and mentees based on shared experiences and areas of interest in order to develop the mentee’s goals and career skills, help them address and overcome challenges in their career and/or workplace, and also to broaden the mentor’s perspectives and mentoring skills."
