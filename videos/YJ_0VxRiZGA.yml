description: 'Elixir is an exciting new language, with a growing usage and a thriving community. However, no language is a silver bullet, and some things are better in other lands. This talk came to be during our efforts to develop Xerpa using Elixir from day-0. Some of the features required integrating with libraries written in other languages. In this talk I''m going to show what are the options to make Elixir (and Erlang) talk to the outside world and caveats you should be aware!'
