title: 'Abstracting PaaS services to be portable with Spring Cloud'
recordingDate: 1401913469
description: "Speaker: Ramnivas Laddad\nSlides: https://speakerdeck.com/ramnivas/abstracting-paas-services-to-be-portable-with-spring-cloud\n\nDeveloping an application to a cloud platform involves working with deployed application's environment and connecting to services. Spring Cloud, a new project, simplifies these tasks in a variety of cloud platforms including Cloud Foundry and Heroku. Spring Cloud makes it possible to deploy the same artifact (a war or a jar) to multiple cloud environments. It supports multiple clouds through the concept of Cloud Connector and provides out of the box implementation for Cloud Foundry and Heroku, and extension points for other cloud platforms.\n\nIn this talk, we will introduce the Spring Cloud project, show how you can simplify configuring applications for cloud deployment, discuss its extensibility mechanism, and put it to good use by showing practical examples from the field.\n\nLearn more about Spring Cloud at http://projects.spring.io/spring-cloud\n\nLearn more about CloudFoundry at http://cloudfoundry.org/learn\n\nLearn more about Heroku at https://devcenter.heroku.com/\n"
