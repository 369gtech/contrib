recordingDate: 1535370318
description: "Interested in Kotlin? And why not - it’s a pragmatic language designed to remove ceremony, solve real world problems and still feel familiar to newcomers. It can target the JVM, Android, JavaScript and native code, even running on iOS. That’s a lot of reach for a single programming language.\nIn this talk, we’ll go on a high level, introductory tour of Kotlin - how to get up and running, what Kotlin looks like, and how to write idiomatic, concise code - functional or object oriented. We’ll look at data classes, top level and first class functions, inlining, null safety and more, including the design decisions behind some of the language choices. We’ll see how you can build DSLs, with examples from Android and HTML, and look at how we can build multi-platform projects. And we’ll take a look at coroutines, Kotlin’s answer to C#’s async/await."
