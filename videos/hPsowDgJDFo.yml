description: "micro.sphere.it #6 Kotlin presents: \nInkuire – Using types as search keys in Kotlin libraries by Andrzej Ratajczak & Kacper Korban\n\nAbstract:\nProgrammers tend to use strongly typed languages for the safety in the runtime and their own comfort while developing applications. While using new dependency, they often have to browse the documentation by symbolic names of classes and functions. Oftentimes, they don’t know the function name, but are convinced there must be a function somewhere that fits given type transformation.\n\nIn this talk, we will focus on a prototype tool that lets you browse the docs using types as search keys in Kotlin.\n\nBios:\nAndrzej is a fourth-year student of Computer Science faculty at the AGH University. Proud open-source tooling contributor to dokka (Kotlin doctool) and Scala3doc (Scala3 doctool) as Junior Developer at VirtusLab.\n\nKacper is a fourth-year Computer Science student at AGH UST and Junior Scala Developer at VirtusLab. Waiting for Haskell to become mainstream."
