Most of the time, these improvements come about gradually as the result of many small optimizations. Once in a while, though, a radical redesign of the framework's internals will bring about a major leap, often without changing a single line of application code.\n\nThis is the goal of the Angular Ivy project - to build a new rendering architecture for one of the web's largest frameworks. At its core is an instruction set for rendering Angular templates, integrated into the framework using set of techniques and design patterns that leverage the capabilities of the modern ES6 ecosystem, taking full advantage of transpilers, bundlers, and tree-shakers. Ivy is a way of thinking about application design that's applicable to any application, large or small.\n\nThis talk covers the design and philosophy of Angular Ivy from its instructions on up. It will illustrate exactly how the new architecture achieves major gains in performance and code size, and show you how to apply these same techniques to your own applications.\n\nAlex Rickabaugh \nFrom Google, Inc.\nAlex Rickabaugh is a software engineer at Google, and for the last three years has been a core member of the Angular team. Throughout his time on Angular, Alex has worked on the Service Worker implementation for Progressive Web Apps, server-side rendering support, and a rewrite of the HTTP API. Currently he works on the Angular Compiler, getting it ready for the next generation architecture, Angular Ivy."
