language: English
recordingDate: 1528330832
description: "In this session, we revealed the magic of graphs.  Graph analysis can answer questions like detecting patterns of fraud or identifying influential customers, quickly and efficiently.  With our 50+ prebuilt graph analytics, you can easily add graphs to your Oracle application, without being a graph expert.\n\nAlbert showed the Java API for graph analytics, and tools and code to invoke them (including Groovy shell and Zeppelin notebooks).  Zhe then showed these in practice with 2 use case examples:  a retail product recommender system, and a finance fraud detection system to identify circular payments.\n\nSlides are available here:  https://www.slideshare.net/JeanIhm/gain-insights-with-graph-analytics \n\nThis is the 3rd video in a series.  Watch the previous sessions here:  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3ZqpALcm8HNVrhEE2j6m-hTCv4zbdFwa \n\nHighlights:\n\n00:00 – Welcome, the story so far. Jean recaps previous sessions (graph intro, architecture, use cases)\n\n07:40 - APIs for graph analytics.  Albert shows the “how”:  tools/code to invoke graph analytic functions, including how to access the Java API from: \n\n  09:10 - Groovy shell\n  11:20 - Zeppelin notebooks\n  25:55 - PGQL query language\n\n25:14 - List of the 50+ prebuilt graph analytic functions in Oracle Spatial and Graph, and their applications \n\n28:20 - Graph Analytics in practice.  Zhe shows the “what”:  use cases and demos.  Which graph analytics should we use, how do we invoke them, and what do the results look like?  The use cases:\n\n   28:30 - Build a recommender system for retail, to recommend products that specific customers are likely to want\n   46:36 - Circular payment fraud detection – a real world finance use case from a Chinese tax authority\n\n54:40 – Resources and wrapup\n\nhttps://developer.oracle.com/\nhttps://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/tryit\n\n\nmusic: bensound.com"
