description: "The Internet of Things and the rise of an M2M ecosystem have long been expected. As this ecosystem converges with big data, we need a seamless device-to-data-center platform. Oracle Java Embedded Suite, targeting data gateways, brings middleware capabilities down to the embedded device level. It can collect data and share it with data centers in real time for immediate processing or save it for analysis. Oracle Event Processing for Oracle Java Embedded, designed to be deployed with Oracle Java Embedded Suite, enables processing data closer to the source. In this session, a Oracle Java Embedded Suite and Oracle Event Processing port on Freescale’s i.MX6D processor, based on ARM Cortex A9, is used to demo how the software platform data processing capabilities can be combined with hardware.\n\n\nAuthors:\nJaiprakash Suri\nJai leads Java product strategy at Oracle for embedded devices and the device to datacenter platform.\nView more trainings by Jaiprakash Suri at https://www.parleys.com/author/jaiprakash-suri\n\nMaulin Patel\nNo bio available\nView more trainings by Maulin Patel at https://www.parleys.com/author/maulin-patel\n\nKwok Wu\nKwok Wu has many years of diverse experience in advanced embedded systems and software, as well as in FPGA software development and Electronic Design Automation (EDA).
