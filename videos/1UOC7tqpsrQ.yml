description: "Web development changed dramatically during the last years. With the enormous amount of JavaScript libraries and the new HTML5 standard, today it is much easier to create web apps. When building a web app, you will probably want to reuse some of the web components you built. But how you can do that with the current state of HTML?\n\nOne of the new and emerging web standards is Web Components. The Web Components standard enables you to create reusable web components that include HTML, CSS and JavaScript.On the other hand, crafting raw components can be cumbersome. This is were Stencil comes into place.\n\nIn this short session you will get familiar with Stencil, a compiler that generates standard-complaint Web Components."
