description: 'Spring Boot is a stack enabling you to kickstart your Spring application in a matter of minutes. It has been a resounding success among both developers already using Spring and microservices adopters. Favoring Spring Boot over the traditional Spring framework comes at a cost, though: you have to let Boot in control and some like to know everything what happens. Come to this talk to discover about auto-configuration and the different flavors of conditionals. After this talk, you’ll be able to understand Spring Boot internals and develop your own starter dependency.'
