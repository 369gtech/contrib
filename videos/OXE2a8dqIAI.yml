I replaced the usage with the updated method described here (https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/workflow-commands-for-github-actions#environment-files)\n\nTimeStamps:\n0:00 - Intro\n1:18 - Project Overview\n2:21 - Application Architecture\n4:14 - Part 1: Getting the initial project running\n7:51 - Part 2: Dockerize the application\n9:55 - Docker-compose\n11:51 - Aside: Makefiles!\n12:31 - Part 3: Terraform (Infrastructure as Code)\n17:16 - Setting up Terraform providers\n22:21 - GCP Resources\n25:55 - Terraform variables\n28:23 - Atlas MongoDB Resources\n31:42 - Cloudflare Resources\n34:33 - Aside: Secrets/credential management\n37:21 - Part 4: Deploying Manually \n44:25 - Part 5: CI/CD with Github Actions\n50:14 - Testing the Github action\n51:25 - Separate staging and production\n57:22 - Outro"
