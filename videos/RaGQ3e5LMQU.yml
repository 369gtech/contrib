description: "SREcon16 Europe - Past, Present, and Future of Network Operations\n\nDavid Barroso, Fastly\n\nHistorically the network has lacked the skills, the tools and even the means to fully embrace automation or build abstractions for the rest of the organization to consume. However, the tide is changing and most modern equipment nowadays provide standard linux tools or open APIs to interact with them.\n\nIn this talk, we will explore how to build network abstractions and leverage on the experience gathered by the devops community over the years to expose the network to the organization, increase agility and provide situational awareness.\n\nView the full SREcon16 Europe Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon16europe/program"
