title: 'Serverless: The Future of the Cloud?! - Bert Ertman'
language: English
recordingDate: 1637316030
description: "Are you still using Docker in production? Get over it! Serverless is the NEW future of the Cloud. But since the Cloud is still someone else's computer, that needs to be managed too. And if it is sitting idle, you probably have to pay for it whether you like it or not. No server can be more easily managed than no server. Therefore: meet Serverless, a new paradigm that truly approaches the Pay-as-You-Go philosophy once promised by the Cloud.\n\nThis talk explores Serverless, its impact on existing architectures, and assesses it's usability for Mobile Back-ends as a Service (MBaaS), Functions-as-a-Service (FaaS) and also for Microservices based architectures hosted in the cloud. Internet connectivity permitting, there will be demos too.\n#Serverless\n\nPresented by Bert Ertman\n\nSubscribe to our channel: https://youtube.pl/c/DevoxxPoland?sub_confirmation=1\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DevoxxPL\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/grzegorz.duda.official/\n\nJoin us also here:\nTechnology Radar Review: https://dworld.pl/radar\nDevelopers World Academy: https://dworld.pl/akademia\nDevflix: https://devflix.pl\n\n#Devoxx #DevoxxPoland #IT #Development #SoftwareDevelopment"
