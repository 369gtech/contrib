description: "Get Everything Here: http://goo.gl/JmTrs\n\nI've been asked many times to create a program that handles Java collision detection with polygons. This is a continuation of my tutorial on how to make a Java video game and if you haven't been watching you should check it out.\n\nIt is surprisingly easy to handle collision detection with polygons. All you have to do is surround all of your polygons with rectangles and a handy dandy method named intersects handles pretty much everything else!"
