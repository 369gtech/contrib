title: 'C# List - Tuning Up InsertRange() - Part 2'
recordingDate: 1389363333
description: 'Inserting into a C# List using InsertRange() may require the C# List to enlarge itself (thus copying elements from the old underlying array to a new underlying array) and then copy again to shuffle items down the array to make room for the new items. In our C# List InsertRange() method, we dodge the extra copy by placing the copied items where they should be in the first place. We trade memory and some time overhead for a huge speed gain.'
