description: "Enabling Invisible Infrastructure Upgrades with Automated Canary Analysis\n\nAdam McKenna, Pinterest\n\nIn the DevOps world, we spend inordinate amounts of time testing our software builds and deployments. But often, the underlying infrastructure is taken for granted. When it becomes time to upgrade, we scramble and toil to migrate everything before our infrastructure goes end-of-life and becomes unsupported.\n\nUpgrading operating systems, language runtimes, and other infrastructure can introduce subtle issues that can go unseen until the new components are deployed at scale.\n\nThis talk will introduce the concept of using automated canary analysis for infrastructure upgrades. Canary analysis is an ideal strategy to minimize risk, retain organizational knowledge, and give service owners peace of mind.\n\nhttps://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa19/conference-program"
