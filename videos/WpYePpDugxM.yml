description: 'The tech community puts a warped badge of honor around burnout. It’s often seen as an indicator of success and working hard when it’s actually harming the growth of our developer communities and teams. I will cover how to identify burnout within yourself and your colleagues, why compromising your personal life really does affect your work performance and what you can do to turn it all around.'
