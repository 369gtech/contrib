description: "Eclipse MicroProfile moves at a pace that is very unfamiliar to our past experiences with Java EE. Thatâ€™s why Red Hat, in conjunction with other vendors and the community, has started the SmallRye project for developing implementations of the Eclipse MicroProfile specifications that can be used by any implementer to facilitate faster turn around of implementations.\n\nThis talk will introduce you to SmallRye and which implementations it works on. While also providing details of the community, where the work is being done, and how you can help us to deliver the best implementations of Eclipse MicroProfile possible.\n\nVoxxed Days Microservices 2018: 2 days conference (+1 optional workshops day) only on Microservices. \n\nFollow us on :\nWebsite : https://voxxeddays.com/microservices (bit.ly/vxdmicro)\nTwitter : https://twitter.com/vxdmicroservice\nLinkedin : https://www.linkedin.com/in/voxxed-days-microservices-906115164\nKeep in touch : https://t.co/pxf7cHZOpl\n\n#developers #conference #microservices"
