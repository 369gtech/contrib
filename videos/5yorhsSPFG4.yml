description: "Ian Ni-Lewis,  Dan Galpin\r\n\r\nWant to make great Android games, but you're not a Java programmer? This talk is for you. Android supports a toolchain for building applications in C/C++. In December 2010 it got a makeover specifically aimed at making life better for game developers. This presentation gives an introduction to Android programming in C/C++, covers what's new and improved since last year, and shows best practices for building and debugging games with the NDK."
