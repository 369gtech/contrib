description: "https://cppcon.org/\nhttps://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2020\n---\nJITting code is a feature of many languages but has not yet landed in C++. However, there has been some work to integrate JITting into Clang by Hal Finkel. Having a JIT compiler offers flexibility at runtime without sacrificing compile-time performance, and can take advantage of late optimizations that maybe even better than those available at compile-time.\n\nC++ is still in the early stages of exploring JIT capabilities. In this talk, we'll expand the boundaries and the possibilities of JITting in C++ by combining C++20 features with the clang-jit compiler work introduced in P1609. We'll show some use cases we find non-obvious and exciting and that may change the future of compile-time programming by blurring the boundary between compile-time and runtime.\n\n---\nBen was in the game industry for 23 years, at companies like EA and Blizzard. For the last couple of years he's been working in the finance industry at Quantlab. He's always looking for useful new techniques in C++, and he geeks out on algorithms, APIs, types and functional programming.\n\nKris is a Senior Software Engineer passionate about programming and has worked in different industries over the years including telecommunications, games and most recently finance for Quantlab Financial, LLC. He has an interest in modern C++ development with a focus on performance and quality. He is an open-source enthusiast with multiple open-source libraries where he uses template meta-programming techniques to support the C++ rule - \"Don't pay for what you don't use\" whilst trying to be as declarative as possible with a help of domain-specific languages. Kris is also a keen advocate of extreme programming techniques, Test/Behavior Driven Development and truly believes that 'the only way to go fast is to go well!'.\n\n---\nStreamed & Edited by Digital Medium Ltd - events.digital-medium.co.uk\nevents@digital-medium.co.uk"
