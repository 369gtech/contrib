description: "Speaker: Haley Brown\n\nThe freelance work/life balance is a bit challenging to get right. Having the freedom to work at home (or anywhere) is a major perk for freelancers. But because you’re the boss, you’re always driven to check your emails even on weekends or work until late at night to crunch numbers and keep the money rolling in. Work can become an overwhelming presence in your personal life and you suddenly feel like you’re always “working”.\n\nThere are strategies you can employ to avoid business burnout and create work/life balance, which includes setting boundaries between work and personal life, creating processes and delegating work.\n\nIn this talk, you will learn different ways on how to manage a healthy work/life balance and relieve the stress of self-employment while ensuring a recurring income.\n\nAbout the speaker\n\nHaley is the straight-shooting head honcho of Brand Shack. A guru in all things design and project management on a mission to create the perfect work-life balance\n\nAs a first time mum she has managed to take 6 months leave whilst her business continued to manage clients needs and bring in a consistent income.\n\nWhen she’s not busy designing or working with clients, she loves nothing more than travelling the globe on her quest to find the perfect pina colada.\n\n\nEvent Page: https://2019.singapore.wordcamp.org/sessions/#wcorg-session-1339\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/BEH5L/"
