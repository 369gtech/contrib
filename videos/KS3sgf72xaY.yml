language: English
recordingDate: 1532044800
description: "In this talk I will introduce LSTMs. This is how deep learning deals with time series data. The dataset we will be focusing on is Trump's tweets. Using this data we will make a tweet generator in which we will train how to simulate Trump style tweets one character at a time.\n\nWe will be using Keras to generate the Deep Learning model. Google colab will be used so that all attendees will be able to use a GPU.\n\nSachin has a PhD in Bayesian Machine Learning and currently working as a data scientist. He is also the author of DeepSchool.io; a platform to teach software engineers the A-Z of Deep Learning.\n\n For more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
