title: 'Stories as Systems: How emerging narrative tools are shaping the future of storytelling'
recordingDate: 1548364318
description: "Mark Rickerby\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/242/\n\nAlthough storytelling across cultures has reused common structural elements for thousands of years, this extraordinary consistency has defied explanation. There is no unified theory of narrative that can fully explain the rich complexity and affect of the stories we love. \r\n\r\nTo augment and extend our powers of generative storytelling using computers, such a theory—if it existed—would be extremely helpful! Whether our goal is to create experimental dramatic fiction or to develop game systems that dynamically respond and adapt to player input and simulation events, somehow we need to encode knowledge of narrative structures in a form that can be manipulated by our tools and algorithms.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we’ll take a whirlwind tour through different computational models for representing narrative structure and how they’ve been put into practice in emerging open source tools.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to create systems that balance the strict causal logic of plots and conflict models with the dreamlike free-association found in fairytales and modernist fiction? To answer this question, we’ll compare and contrast ideas from the cutting-edge of narrative AI research with the creative practices of contemporary novelists who approach story structure in surprising and innovative ways.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
