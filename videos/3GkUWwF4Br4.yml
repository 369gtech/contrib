description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nExporting your trace telemetry with OpenTelemetry and Fluent Bit - Aditya Jagdishkumar Prajapati\n\nFluent Bit is a popular log forwarding solution that lets you collect any data like metrics and logs from different sources and send them to multiple destinations, which you might be already using. In this talk, Aditya will introduce you to tracing concepts and demonstrate how you can collect trace telemetry and send it to the backend of your choice by using Opentelemetry, an open-source, vendor-agnostic solution to collect observability data for cloud-native applications. By changing a few lines of configuration and code, you can harness the power of OpenTelemetry without the need to deploy additional OpenTelemetry or Fluent Bit agents."
