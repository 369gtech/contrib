description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Copenhagen 2021. #GOTOcon #GOTOcph\nhttp://gotocph.com\n\nAdam Such - Principal Solutions Architect for the Nordics region at Sonatype\n\nABSTRACT\nInstinctively, we understand how critical this is, especially in a time of growing high profile attacks on software supply chains across the world - most recently Dependency Confusion, the Cloudflare and SolarWinds breach - embracing security as a development team has never been more important.\nDone properly, DevSecOps practices shouldn’t interrupt the DevOps pipeline - but instead aid it - preventing costly rebuilds and build failures, down the road. By creating automated governance that is embedded early and throughout the software development lifecycle, developers have transparent access to digital guardrails integrated within our native tools — an approach that ensures security is being built in without slowing [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n02:12 What you will learn\n03:00 Why is there a new wave of cybersecurity attacks?\n06:34 Where do vulnerabilities enter your supply chain?\n12:37 Typosquatting\n15:46 Namespace confusion\n18:06 Malicious code injections\n20:40 How to prevent future attacks?\n22:30 8 Rules\n31:20 Outro\n\nRead the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotocph.com/2021/sessions/1959/adapting-devops-in-a-world-of-growing-software-supply-chain-attacks\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nAaron Parecki • OAuth 2.0 Simplified • https://amzn.to/2A3IMOf\nAaron Parecki • OAuth 2.0 Servers • https://amzn.to/3ecHEsz\nAaron Parecki • The Little Book of OAuth 2.0 RFCs • https://amzn.to/3i7qnlC\nErdal Ozkaya • Cybersecurity: The Beginner's Guide • https://amzn.to/2T6OIj3\nForsgren, Humble & Kim • Accelerate: The Science of Lean Software and DevOps • https://amzn.to/3tCz1xO\nJohn Arundel & Justin Domingus • Cloud Native DevOps with Kubernetes • https://amzn.to/3hKZvI5\nWynne, Hellesoy & Tooke • The Cucumber Book • https://amzn.to/3tEUINJ\nRobert C.
