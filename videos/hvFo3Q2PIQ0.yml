description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2014\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nAdrian Cockcroft - Technology Fellow, Architect Behind Netflix Cloud Infrastructure\n\nABSTRACT\nCompanies of all sizes and backgrounds are having to deal with the transition to a world where software development is central to their existence and competitiveness. To deliver software products at high velocity requires four things. First, a culture of innovation that can see and respond to opportunities. Second, the data and analytics to evaluate alternatives. Third, a culture that can make decisions and assign resources quickly. Fourth, agile development and self service deployment. A fine grain loosely coupled architecture scales as the team size grows, a freedom and responsibility culture provides autonomy for innovation and fast decision making, unstructured \"big data\" analytics gets answers quickly, cloud removes the latency of resource allocation, and devops removes the coordination latency that slows down deployment. These ideas have made Netflix very successful, and Adrian is now taking them to a broader audience in his new role at Battery Ventures.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
