description: "Speaker: Christy Heaton\n\nIn this tutorial, we will introduce Python as a spatial problem solving and data visualization tool. To demonstrate the power of Python for spatial analysis, we will solve a spatial problem and make a beautiful map of our results. Along the way, we will discuss considerations when dealing with spatial data and the wide range of Python tools available for spatial analysis.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2018 and https://github.com/PyCon/2018-slides"
