title: 'DEF CON 27 Conference - Christopher Wade - Tag side attacks against NFC'
language: English
recordingDate: 1573862414
description: "This talk covers tag-side attacks against NFC communication protocols, including cracking of Mifare encryption keys and performing targeted attacks against NFC readers. In addition, it will cover the design and creation of devices capable of emulating NFC tags down to the raw protocol using standard components and tools, with no abstraction to dedicated hardware, covering and expanding on the capabilities of available products. This talk will contain how 13.56MHz NFC works at a raw level, how tools can be built for analysing it, how the protocol can be implemented in full on standard Microcontrollers, and the security weaknesses present in its design.\n\nChristopher Wade\nChris is a seasoned security researcher and testing consultant. His main focuses are in reverse engineering hardware, fingerprinting USB vulnerabilities and playing with Software Defined Radios, with his key strength lying in firmware analysis, which he utilises as part of the hardware testing team at Pen Test Partners.\n\nTwitter: @Iskuri1\nGithub: https://github.com/Iskuri"
