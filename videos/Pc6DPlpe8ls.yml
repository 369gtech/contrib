description: "\"When you first started experimenting with Kubernetes, you may have started locally or on a set of servers. With simple applications, you may only have used a container registry and Kubernetes itself. When looking to move your clusters to a production setting, there are many more considerations, such as: How will I manage my clusters? How do I handle monitoring and logging? How do I safely back up my cluster resources? How do I ensure that my container images are safe and secure?\n\nLetâ€™s take a look at some production-ready solutions, such as VMware Tanzu Mission Control, VMware Tanzu Observability by Wavefront, Velero, and Harbor.\"\n\nTiffany Jernigan, Senior Developer Advocate at VMware\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/make-your-kubernetes-clusters-productionready-with-vmware-tanzu"
