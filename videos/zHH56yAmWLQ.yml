title: 'Building payment processing engine with Stateful Functions and Spring Boot'
recordingDate: 1635787808
description: 'The cost of an error in the Fintech industry is enormous, especially regarding the payment processing engine. While such software products must support multiple independent payment processing flows, it''s pretty easy to transform requirements into a highly complex system that is hard to maintain. During this talk, I''ll build a payment processing engine powered by Stateful Functions in Java. I''ll explain the tradeoff between embedded and remote modules and implement a remote one with two separate namespaces. You''ll see how to integrate Stateful Functions with Spring Boot to build next-gen event-driven systems.'
