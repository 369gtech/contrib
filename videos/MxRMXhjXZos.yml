title: '2012 PyData Workshop: Data Analysis in Python with Pandas'
recordingDate: 1333133542
description: "Coming from the 2012 PyData Workshop, Wes McKinney, CTO and cofounder of Lambda Foundry, gives us a tour of Pandas, a rich data manipulation tool built on top of NumPy. Frustrated with working in R, Wes started building Pandas in 2008 with a focus on fast, intuitive data structures and data manipulation capabilities. The Pandas project has seen huge growth in the last few years, and aims to be the ultimate data tool for Python.\r\n\r\n** More educational resources on open source development at http://marakana.com\r\n** See the rest of the presentations from the 2012 PyData Workshop here - http://mrkn.co/3tkq2"
