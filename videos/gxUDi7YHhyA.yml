description: "Bringing Google Customer Reliability Engineering to Cloud Foundry - Luke Stone, Google & Andrew Clay Shafer, Pivotal\n\nToward the end of 2016, Google announced Customer Reliability Engineering (CRE), an outward-facing branch of Site Reliability Engineers (SRE) to help bring Google-class operational excellence to customer applications running on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). GCP customers who are in the CRE program adhere to the principles and practices of SRE, starting with a joint review of application reliability that brings the same rigor Google applies to internal services.\n\nPivotal and Google Cloud are currently working through a CRE review to bring Pivotal Cloud Foundry into the CRE program. This session will give an overview of the work being done together and the benefits to be had for customers running PCF on GCP. \n\nPivotal Cloud Foundry is the first third-party platform GCP has collaborated with for CRE support, and together the goal is to have shared customers meet their service level objectives reliably, without anxiety, and without extraordinary effort.\n\nLuke Stone\nLuke is defining the customer experience of Googleâ€™s new Customer Reliability Engineering (CRE) team. When he joined Google in 2002 he was the first technical support engineer for AdSense. He ran software engineering teams and started building on Google App Engine in 2009. Recently, he led the technical support team for Google Cloud Platform before becoming a founding member of the CRE team. Before Google, Luke was a system administrator and developer in academic and non-profit organizations, and studied computer science at Stanford.\n\nAndrew Clay Shafer\nPivotal\nAndrew Clay Shafer has built a career helping people improve technology and processes for delivering software services. As a co-founder of Puppet Labs, he evangelized DevOps practices and tools before DevOps was a word. He got first hand experience implementing and operating cloud infrastructure as the the VP of Engineering at Cloudscaling. Now at Pivotal, Andrew focuses on helping the Cloud Foundry ecosystem and Pivotal customers leverage platforms to build the future."
