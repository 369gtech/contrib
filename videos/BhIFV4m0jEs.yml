description: "by Krzysztof Cieslak\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/K.3.201/dotnet_fsharp_reinventing_mvc.webm\n\n\nThe MVC pattern has been one of the most important architectural patterns for server-side web development - it has been implemented and popularized by frameworks like Ruby On Rail or ASP.NET MVC. However, this pattern was traditionally coupled with object-oriented programming. In the talk, I will show how to reinvent MVC pattern, and structure your web application in a functional language - F#. \n\nThe talk will cover some brief introduction to F# - modern functional programming language running on .Net platform, show how to model MVC layers using functional composition, and at the end show some examples of applying MVC pattern with Saturn - opinionated, web development framework for F# which implements the server-side, functional MVC pattern \n\nRoom: K.3.201\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 16:30:00+01"
