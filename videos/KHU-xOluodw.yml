description: "More webinars from Erlang Solutions: https://www.erlang-solutions.com/resources/webinars.html\n\nSportrisq are a broker and distributor of risk management solutions and products to the sports industry. Sportsrisq's core platform is written in Python; however, as a result of Python's poor threading model, they were experiencing issues with certain low- latency components within their stack.\nIn this webinar Sportsrisq's CTO Justin Worall will describe the process of migrating two of those components to Erlang; the underlying problems involved, the perceived benefits of Erlang in those situations, the decision making process, the application designs and the results."
