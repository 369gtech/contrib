description: "The naïve programmer\n[EuroPython 2018 - Talk - 2018-07-25 - Kilsyth]\n[Edinburgh, UK]\n\nBy Daniele Procida\n\nSince Picasso encountered Henri Rousseau over a century ago, modern art has been acutely aware of the value of the contributions that the naïve artist can make. Art negotiates the relationship between sophistication and naïvety with care and intelligence.\n\nWhat does our programming culture make of the naïve programmer?  What can programming gain or learn from this encounter? \n\nThe naïve programmer is simply an unsophisticated programmer. Nobody is born sophisticated. Even the most sophisticated programmers were once naïve programmers. What's more, the adoption of programming simply as a tool to solve immediate problems, by ever more people without any formal training, means that the number of naïve programmers will become greater, not less. Are we ready for this?\n\nThis talk will explore the relationship, illuminating it with examples from the world of painting, art and music, and will offer some lessons that our own industry and culture should be ready to learn from.\n\n(This talk will already have been presented as a keynote at DjangoCon Europe 2018)\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2018.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
