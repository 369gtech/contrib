description: '#Codemotion Rome 2018 - Making decisions by yourself is hard, let alone with a team. As developers, making good technical decisions in teams is key to our jobs yet we don''t explicitly learn how to do that. As someone who has found technical argumentation difficult, I have been thinking about this topic for years: argumentation in teams should not be about winning and losing. I will introduce a framework teams can use to evaluate options and find consensus when making big technical decisions, with an example.'
