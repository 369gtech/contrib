title: 'Talk: Math, Juggling, Hidden Markov Models, and embedded Python - NDC Techtown 2017'
recordingDate: 1511517475
description: "It is a common misconception that math is about plus, minus, fractions and the like. In this talk we will use juggling as a starting point to identify some of the finer points in the nature of mathematics.\n\nWe will specially focus on the concept of abstraction, and together we will develop a beautiful and abstract model of juggling. Armed with our model, we will use juggling balls with embedded Python to perform some neat real-time analysis of juggling and see how it relates to our abstract model. We will then explore the historical context of our model by traveling to ancient Greece, have a short stop at the Vatican state, look at some Japanese Origami, and finally ending in deep space. Everything is connected.\n\nSpeaker: Jan Dyre Bjerknes"
