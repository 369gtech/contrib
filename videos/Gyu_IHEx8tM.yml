recordingDate: 1408633203
description: "Originally recorded on May 21, 2014. Erratum: At 11:35, Trove project originated at Red Hat. In fact, Trove originated at Hewlett-Packard, as the slides correctly state. Apologies for the error â€” Florian.\n\nOpenStack, the fastest growing infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) platform in the open source community, has recently added a database-as-a-service (DBaaS) component named Trove, which saw its first production OpenStack release in April. Trove's purpose is to provide scalable and reliable cloud DBaaS provisioning functionality for both relational and non-relational database engines.\n\nIn this webcast led by Florian Haas, he'll cover the architecture of Trove, and demonstrates the deployment of OpenStack Trove on an OpenStack private cloud, in order to provide MySQL DBaaS to OpenStack users. It is useful both for private cloud operators intending to deploy DBaaS, and to MySQL DBAs learning to interact with MySQL in an OpenStack DBaaS environment.\n\nAbout Florian Haas:\nFlorian is an open source software specialist, experienced technical consultant, seasoned training instructor, and frequent public speaker. He has spoken at conferences like LinuxCon, OSCON, linux.conf.au, the OpenStack Summit, the MySQL Conference and Expo, and countless user and meetup groups across the globe."
