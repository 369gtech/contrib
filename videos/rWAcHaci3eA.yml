recordingDate: 1385753470
description: "It takes time to become really good at something. Time, commitment and a genuine passion. If you're not having fun the learning is a chore, if you are then it hardly feels like learning at all, at least not like the thing they made you do in school. Craftsmanship is about making that commitment and then figuring out how to see it through. \n\nUsing examples of mastery from various fields and a thirty year paper-folding habit, Dan describes some of the many facets of craftsmanship and tries to figure out exactly what the craft is that we programmers do.\n\nDan North has been coaching, coding and consulting for over 20 years, with a focus on applying systems thinking and simple technology to solve complex business problems. He uses techniques from Lean operations, Theory of Constraints and Agile software development to help IT organisations anticipate and respond to the challenges of changing business needs."
