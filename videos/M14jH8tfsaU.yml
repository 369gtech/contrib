language: English
recordingDate: 1492094863
description: "This session demonstrates how all of the worldâ€™s knowledge may be semantically navigated by a web application that utilizes the facilities of Wikimedia.org projects (e.g. Wikipedia and Wikidata). The web application was created specifically for this session, and demonstrates technologies that include Java, HTML5, Spring Data, Neo4j, Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, and Cloud Foundry. The application runs in the cloud and contains/leverages several microservices. We'll walk through lots of code during this session.\n\nJames Weaver is a Java developer, author, and speaker with a passion for helping Java to be increasingly leveraged in cloud-native and machine learning applications. He is a Java Champion, and a JavaOne Rockstar. James has written books including Inside Java, Beginning J2EE, the Pro JavaFX series, and Java with Raspberry Pi. As an Pivotal Developer Advocate, James speaks internationally at software technology conferences about Java and Cloud Native development. James tweets as @JavaFXpert, blogs at http://JavaFXpert.com and http://CulturedEar.com and may be reached at jweaver [at] pivotal.io"
