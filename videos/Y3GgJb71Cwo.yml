description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nBeyond File and Block Storage in Kubernetes - Sidhartha Mani, MinIO \n\nKubernetes graduated Container Storage Interface (CSI) to GA status in v1.13. It has since evolved to support a large number of vendors and storage formats. It has brought the industry together in consensus about the best practices in storage. CSI only supports Block and File storage. Object storage is a fundamentally different paradigm where data is accessed over the network rather than locally. It allows applications to remain stateless, while offloading state into a blackbox over the network. Object storage is the key enabler for cloud migration. This paradigm however, does not have a standard mechanism for consumption in Kubernetes. In this talk, we discuss our efforts in bringing object storage into the forefront of kubernetes and introduce the Container Object Storage Interface (COSI) and cover: - Need for COSI - Best practices for using COSI - Designing apps to leverage COSI \n\nhttps://sched.co/ekF8"
