description: "Turkey’s leading GSM operator, Turkcell, has improved its marketing activities by implementing a rule-based marketing (RBM) application. RBM is a system that listens to and filters the network events of customers, based on business demands, and proposes suitable offers to customers. Nearly 800 million events per day are being processed by more than 100 business flows on this system, and the impact on net income is nearly US$14 million, triple pre-RBM sales. The system requires continuous upgrades and tuning as it grows rapidly. Therefore, Turkcell decided to use Oracle Coherence to improve the system’s performance. This session covers how it tuned the system with Oracle Coherence.\n\n\nAuthor:\nHasan Ali YUCE\nHasan Ali Yuce, has 5 years experience on software development.
