description: "Kathy Reid\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/103/\n\nScribus is an open source desktop publishing tool, akin to Publisher or InDesign. It is a powerful, complex application that produces beautiful, professional quality layout designs, suitable for printing or PDFing. \r\n\r\nScribus has a steep learning curve, and this can stop people from wanting to learn more about them. \r\n\r\nIn this 100-minute tutorial, we will cover\r\n\r\n* Document setup, page sizes and margins\r\n* Concepts of grouping, alignment and distribution\r\n* Layout elements such as images, shapes and layering\r\n* Working with text using character and paragraph styles, and a primer on fonts\r\n* Colours for printing, and using the colour palette in Scribus\r\n* Exporting to PDF and considerations for PDF such as file size reduction\r\n\r\nPrerequisites: \r\n\r\n* Ensure that you have Scribus installed on your laptop prior to attending the tutorial\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
