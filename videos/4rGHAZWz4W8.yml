title: 'Terraform Best Practices with Examples and Arguments by Anton Babenko at DevOps Unicorns'
recordingDate: 1571144738
description: "It is easy to get started with Terraform to manage infrastructure as code. Just read the documentation on terraform.io, and you are done. Almost.\nThe harder part begins when infrastructure grows in all directions (several AWS/GCP accounts, regions, teams, projects, environments, external integrations). One of the most frequent questions is “how to structure code”.\nIn this talk, Anton will explain many of challenges related to that, what works, what does not work, why so, and most importantly he will show all the code which works from small projects to very-large infrastructures (featuring multi-cloud and multi-region setup).\nThis talk is best suitable for people who have been using Terraform at least for some time and already have practical questions, but there will be some basic information for newcomers also.\nMost of the content used for the talk can be found on this site here – www.terraform-best-practices.com"
