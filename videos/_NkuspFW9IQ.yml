description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nKubernetes IoT Edge WG: Intro to K8s at Edge + Device Connection Options - Steven Wong, VMware & Dejan Bosanac, Red Hat\n\nThe K8s IoT Edge working group focuses on using Kubernetes as a tool to support applications running on, communicating with, or using information gathered from edge devices. LoRa has been getting attention as a connection technology featuring long-range communication at low cost (power and financial). This session will open with an introduction to LoRa along with the associated LoRaWAN protocol. What can it do? How does it compare to alternatives (WIFI, BLE and LTE, others). We’ll also talk about the open source “Drogue cloud” project which can support LoraWAN, and other connections, between devices and Kubernetes hosted apps and services. The presentation will include a demo. There are opportunities to contribute to the evolution of Kubernetes to better serve edge use cases. We will close with details on how you can get involved with the community effort to help this happen."
