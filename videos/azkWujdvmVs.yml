description: "Speaker: Nguyen Tuong Van\r\n\r\nMy name is Van. I am a front end developer at Shopee Singapore. In no particular order i like music, coffee, cats, books, black color, Hosoya Yoshimasa.\r\n\r\nReact Hooks is THE hot thing now. More and more people can teach you how to use React Hooks, how they work, what the rules are and why.\r\n\r\nWhat did you first use React Hooks to make? For me, it was to let someone dance.\r\n\r\nJoin me in your black suit and dress as i introduce to you my Tiny Dancer, and how Hooks made me revisit an important concept in Javascript.\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/React-Knowledgeable/events/263825225/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/rHxf/"
