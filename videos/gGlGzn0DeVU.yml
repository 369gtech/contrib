description: "Speaker: Syab Phang\n\nWhen you hear the word \"drone,\" you probably think of a flying gadget.\n\nIn this session, we will have Syab Phang to share with us on how she got started with drones after a friend of hers introduced her to the maker community in Singapore through Repair Kopitiam by Sustainable Living Lab. She was helping out at Maker Faire last year and noticed that there were a lot of booths showcasing the drones that were built. After Maker Faire, there was an open call for applications to OneMaker Group’s Apprenticeship Programme and it was then that she decided to jump into the Drone bandwagon and used that opportunity try and build a drone from scratch.\n\nParticipants will get to know more about drones from Syab's perspective and how you can get start making your own drone!\n\nCredits:\n3:10 to 5:04 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sUeGC-8dyk\n5:05 to 6:15 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPf9vHd4dtk\n\n\nEvent Page: https://www.facebook.com/events/1708189206120200/\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/IVqF/"
