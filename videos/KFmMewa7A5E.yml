description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io\n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nKubernetes is now the de-facto platform to deploy and manage stateless applications. It is also making strides for deploying and managing stateful applications. Managing stateful applications is more than provisioning and relocating containers upon failures. Stateful application deal with data gravity, IP persistence, and almost always mandate procedures to protect data. Traditional methods for protecting data are application-level snapshots or storage snapshots provided by vendors. This method does not suffice for the applications running on Kubernetes. This presentation will shed light on some of the challenges and provide some approaches towards complete data protection for applications such as Oracle RAC, Postgres, Cassandra, MongoDB, etc."
