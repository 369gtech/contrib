description: "This talk will explain what public blockchain systems like Bitcoin and Ripple are, the unique challenges of developing software for them, and how C++ helps to meet these challenges.\n\nSecurity issues are paramount. Blockchain systems are open source, have large attack surfaces, and can cause significant financial damage if they have exploitable defects. Performance and scalability are also major concerns.\n\nC++ provides a unique balance that helps meet these challenges. The language's design makes it possible to catch bugs at compile time, write modular code that can be tested, develop flexible data structures and manage resources. Yet, where performance is critical, it does not obscure what your code is making the computer actually do.\n\nEVENT: CppCon 2016 (http://CppCon.org)\n\nSPEAKER: David Schwartz\n\nPERMISSIONS: Event organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nORIGINAL SOURCE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4jq4frE5v4&t=1s"
