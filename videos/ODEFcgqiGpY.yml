description: "Many organisations rely on strategic systems that are becoming harder and harder to maintain.\n-The business is unhappy because features are taking longer to be built and they cannot react fast enough to market demands.\n-Developers are unhappy because the code is messy and negatively affects their productivity.\n-Testers are unhappy because of the volume of work they have and they still cannot guarantee the quality of the software. Clients are becoming disenchanted because of the lack of quality and slow frequency of updates.\n\nStrategic software cannot become a burden to the organisationâ€”they need to remain strategic and continuously enable business agility.\n\nIn this talk, Sandro Mancuso, Software Craftsman and Co-Founder at Codurance will cover the key aspects of Software Modernisation initiatives and why they are needed.\n\nDiscover how your organisation measures up by using the Codurance Compass self-assessment tool: https://bit.ly/2E5RaP5 \nIf you need more info about Software Modernisation visit https://codurance.com/services/software-modernisation/\nAnd if you would like to learn more about Codurance, please visit our website https://codurance.com/.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMusic: \"Dreams\" from Bensound.com"
