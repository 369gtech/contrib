description: "In this episode of Defrag Tools, we talk about HRESULT based Error Codes. The 32bits in the HRESULT have meanings, allowing the reader to gain additional insights into the error.\n\nOf note:\n\nThe 32nd bit (the top bit) indicates if an error occurred or not. This is why errors are 0x8xxxxxxx.\nThe 16-26 bits are the Facility - the originating API (Win32, CLR, XAML, etc.).\nThe 0-15 bits are the (Error) Code.\n\nCommon NULL Facility Error Codes\n\n\nName\n\nDescription\n\nValue\n\nS_OK Operation successful 0x00000000 \nS_FALSE Operation successful but returned no results 0x00000001 \nE_ABORT Operation aborted 0x80004004 \nE_FAIL Unspecified failure 0x80004005 \nE_NOINTERFACE No such interface supported 0x80004002 \nE_NOTIMPL Not implemented 0x80004001 \nE_POINTER Pointer that is not valid 0x80004003 \nE_UNEXPECTED Unexpected failure 0x8000FFFF \n\nCommon Win32 Facility Error Codes\n\nThese are built by passing a System Error Code to HRESULT_FROM_WIN32\n\n\nName\n\nDescription\n\nValue\n\nE_ACCESSDENIED General access denied error 0x80070005 \nE_HANDLE Handle that is not valid 0x80070006 \nE_INVALIDARG One or more arguments are not valid 0x80070057 \nE_OUTOFMEMORY Failed to allocate necessary memory 0x8007000E \n\nRelated Links:\n\nHRESULT\nHRESULT Facility – By Value\nHRESULT Facility – By Name"
