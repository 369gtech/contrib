Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nKubernetes Security Best Practices - Ian Lewis, Google \n\nContainers give developers the ability to isolate applications from one another, but that’s not enough. Resource isolation is much different that security isolation. How do we make applications deployed in containers more secure? What tools can be we apply to our containers running in Kubernetes to make them more secure? How can we apply policy to our network and services to make sure applications only have access to what they need and nothing more?\n\nIn this talk, attendees will learn about the risks and attack surfaces of a Kubernetes cluster.  s-We'll look at tools like PodSecurityPolicy, SELinux, AppArmor, seccomp, and sandboxed containers in action to improve the security of containers. We’ll then go up the stack and learn how to apply network policy to containers to further improve security."
