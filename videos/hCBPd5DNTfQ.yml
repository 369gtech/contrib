title: 'Error Reporting - Ziv Levy'
recordingDate: 1543837706
description: "Do you use an error reporting system in your software? How do you distinguish between errors and filter them? How do you run your tests without throwing tons of errors to that system? How do you even test error reporting?\n\nZiv talks about error-reporting in modern FED eco-systems. He presents our approach of how to scope and differentiate between errors in “multi-app” systems, and how to conduct testing conveniently and with no hacks.\n\nZiv truly believes that the story about how we solved it, would benefit and inspire others.\n\nWith over 10 years of both backend and frontend experience, Ziv is currently working at Wix.com as a frontend developer, on the very exciting and new Wix Code.\n\nHe is an open-source enthusiast, has a fetish for web performance, and loves technology at its best when it's visual."
