title: 'Love your cache: Optimize for the second load'
language: English
recordingDate: 1608656406
description: "You've built an amazing site with fast load times, great components, and large (but lazily loaded!) assets. However, when you update or redeploy your site, are your users getting the best experience?\n\nWithout careful consideration, existing users might have to download (and parse, and spend effort on) assets that they basically already have in their cache. Learn strategies to minimize the amount of work involved in incremental updates, whether it be for JS, CSS, or larger assets like images.\n\nWe look at build systems in the abstract, and present a modern well-lit path for hosting and caching.\n\nResources:\nLove your cache blog post → https://goo.gle/39HaoZb\nBetter Living Through Caching (Netlify) → https://goo.gle/33fs4qs\nAvoid chaining critical requests (web.dev) → https://goo.gle/3fHlsXa\ntooling.report → https://goo.gle/365koca\nPeriodic Background Sync API → https://goo.gle/3m5BHQ0\n\nSpeaker: Sam Thorogood\n\nWatch all Chrome Developer Summit sessions here → https://goo.gle/cds20-sessions\nSubscribe to Google Chrome Developers here → https://goo.gle/ChromeDevs\n\n#chromedevsummit #chrome #webdevelopment"
