title: 'Feeling Groovy: Experiences as a Groovy Developer in the Java World'
language: English
recordingDate: 1471946402
description: 'Despite the name, Groovy has never been the "hipster" language. It''s greatest advantage -- almost trivial integration with Java -- keeps it from being perceived as exciting and new. Existing Java developers often overlook it when they get frustrated with Java. A small effort by Groovy advocates can change that, however. This talk will demonstrate ways to show hesitant Java developers how much easier their lives can be when adding Groovy to their projects.'
