title: 'Build Libraries Not Frameworks - lecture by Dennis Doomen - Code Europe Autumn 2017'
recordingDate: 1519044183
description: 'Frameworks are supposed to help you build things more quicker and hide a lot of complexity around cross-cutting and infrastructural concerns. They are supposed to make it easier for inexperienced developers to join a running projection. But frameworks also introduce a lot of magic, and that magic is going to backfire at some point. At least, that''s my experience. And when it backfires, your code is so entangled with that framework, that you can''t get rid of it anymore. So, instead of building and using frameworks, build and use libraries. That''s easier said then done, so let me share some of the practices I use to build composable libraries myself. I''ll talk about principles of package design and scoping, keeping your NuGet package dependencies in check, and how to use layered APIs to increase usability without hiding the magic.'
