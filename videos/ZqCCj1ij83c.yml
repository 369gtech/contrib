title: 'Hardware-Secured Docker with Intel Clear Containers'
language: English
recordingDate: 1494276322
description: 'While Linux* containers offer speed and agility advantages, they could raise security concerns. Within the typical namespace isolated and cgroup constrained container model, all containers in a given environment share the same kernel instance. If the kernel is compromised or crashes, so will all the containers running on top of it, making them potentially vulnerable to malicious software-based attacks. We will be discussing IntelÌâå¨s open source project, Clear Containers, and how this technology augments the Docker model by isolating all container workloads through IntelÌâå¨ Virtualization Technology (IntelÌâå¨ VT). By running Docker containers within their dedicated, fast-booting and low-footprint virtual machines, we will explain how Clear Containers keep the high performance, low overhead promise of Linux containers while complementing software isolation with a fully hardware-assisted one. We will then describe the technical challenges we have to overcome in order to seamlessly integrate hardware virtualization into the larger container ecosystem, from networking plugins up to the containers orchestration layers like Docker Swarm or Kubernetes. Finally we will briefly go through the project next steps. After closing many compatibility and stability gaps with the Clear Containers 2.1 release, we are now focusing on components factorization and performance improvements that the whole container ecosystem should benefit from.'
