title: 'DrupalCon Baltimore 2017: Docksal: Better than VMs'
recordingDate: 1493188833
description: "Update:\_BoF for QnA and follow-up discussions: Room 311 @ 3:45PM\n\nGetting a project up and running locally should be something \"quick and easy\". Pull the code, start the stack, maybe grab a DB dump and files, import. Done.\n\nUnfortunately, the reality is somewhat different. Too often that takes hours or even days. Manual setup is tedious, VMs and Vagrant boxes take forever to build or fail to build at all. Developers spend time dealing with sysadmin issues and configurations instead of writing code.\n\nLet's see how all of this can be handled with just\_two commands.\n\n\ngit clone -project-repo\nfin init\nThis is the workflow we are using at FFW\_and we are doing that\_with Docksal.\n\nDocksal is an open-source tool created by FFW for defining and managing development environments. It brings together common development tools, minimizes time spent on configuration, and ensures the consistency of local development environments throughout a teamâ€™s continuous integration workflow.\n\nDocksal automatically configures each project's environment to ensure team members are using the same tools, and versions, regardless of the individual requirements of each project. Most importantly, it makes the entire process easy. Docksal offers fully containerized environments with Docker, provides cross-platform support (MacOS, Windows, and Linux,) and has built-in tools that include:\n\nDrush (6,7,8), Drupal Console, WP-CLI, Composer, PHP Code Sniffer\nRuby (with bundler), Node.js (with nvm, nmp), Python\nApache Solr, Varnish, Memcache and more (including BYO)\nBuilt-in testing support with Behat and Selenium\nZero configuration Xdebug support with PhpStorm\nDocksal will even automatically configure virtual hosts for you, so no more editing host files and server configurations.\n\nIn this session we will:\n\nGo over the basics of using Docker for local development\nCompare the Docker based vs the VM based approach\nGo over the pain points that Docksal eliminates\nInitialize instant environments with zero configuration\nGet a Drupal7 and a\_Drupal8 site\_running side by side using different stack versions\nSee how Docksal can be integrated into an existing project\nHave a sneak peek into some more advanced use case supported in Docksal (e.g. complex, production-like stacks)\nPrior experience using VMs and/or Docker is a plus, but not required."
