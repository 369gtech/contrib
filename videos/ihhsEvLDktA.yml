title: 'How the DoD Use Istio for End-to-End Encryption and Authentication - Zack Butcher & Jeff McCoy'

description: "How the DoD Use Istio for End-to-End Encryption and Authentication - Zack Butcher, Tetrate & Jeff McCoy, Platform One\n\nSecurity remains one of the primary drivers behind service mesh adoption today. We’ll describe why and how Platform One is using a service mesh - Istio - to provide both encryption in transit as well as end-user authentication via SSO for applications across the Department of Defense. We’ll dig into the practical challenges involved in deploying the Istio ecosystem’s authservice, which implements Envoy’s external auth API to provide SSO, and the design considerations that went into making the system incredibly simple for application teams running on Platform One to consume. Finally, we’ll briefly introduce an upcoming NIST IR covering the usage of a service mesh to provide authentication and authorization for applications."
