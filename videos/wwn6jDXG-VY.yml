description: "Tim Dawborn\n\nhttps://2018.pycon-au.org/talks/45178-stupid-computer-improving-error-messages-for-beginner-programmers/\n\nPython is a great beginners programming language. Unfortunately, many of the exception messages coming from the standard library and parser are very unhelpful to a newbie programmer. We identify some of these cases, make modifications to improve these messages, and assess their effectiveness.\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, australia, programming, sydney\n\nThis video is licensed under CC BY 3.0 AU - https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/au/\r\n\r\nPyCon Australia (“PyCon AU”) is the national conference for the Python Programming Community, bringing together professional, student and enthusiast developers with a love for developing with Python.\n\nPyCon AU, the national Python Language conference, is on again this August in Sydney, at the International Convention Centre, Sydney, August 24 - 28 2018.\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU"
