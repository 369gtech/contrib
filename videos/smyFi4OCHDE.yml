title: 'Building Fast and Scalable Persistence Layers with Spring Data JPA'
language: English
recordingDate: 1632325378
description: "Spring Data JPA is the de facto standard for persisting data in a relational database. It provides excellent developer productivity and is so easy to use that you can learn it within a few hours.\n\nThat changes as soon as your application needs to handle a huge amount of data or if you want to guarantee very short response times. Features and concepts that work perfectly fine for smaller applications start to become a burden that slow down your application.\n\nBut that doesn’t have to be the case for your application. Spring Data JPA is a great fit for complex projects with high-performance requirements. You only need to know which features to use and which you should better avoid.\n\nDuring this talk, I’ll show you how to get the most out of your Spring Data JPA-based persistence layer. By following these recommendations, you’ll be able to enjoy Spring Data JPA’s developer productivity and provide a blazingly fast experience to your users.\n\nThorben Janssen, Freelancer at Self-employed\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/building-fast-and-scalable-persistence-layers-with-spring-data-jpa"
