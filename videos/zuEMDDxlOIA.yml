title: 'Networks and Types -- the Future of Akka with Johan Andr√©n'
language: English
recordingDate: 1526483783
description: 'In this talk we''ll explore Akka''s new Typed Actor APIs as well as the over-the-network Akka Streams and how they are able to marry Types with Networks. Akka does so while remaining true to its Erlang-inspired way of building "let it crash" style Reactive Systems, that can react and self heal from failures. As this idea is now becoming more mainstream than ever, we''ll deep dive into these concepts, investigate the trade-offs, failure scenarios and healing mechanisms and how Akka helps to deal with the inherent complexities of such cloud-native systems.'
