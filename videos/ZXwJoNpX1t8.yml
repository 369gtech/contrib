language: English
recordingDate: 1519801241
description: "Learn how to create a read/write cache that scales to Cloud levels. Learn how a SQL based cache can outperfom and replace NoSQL caches. Learn how simple SQL queries can achieve a latency of 1 ms at the 99th percentile. Learn how this cache can be deployed with tools like Maven. Use your favorite language [Java, Python, Go, Ruby, C/C++] and SQL with Oracle Velocity Scale.\n\nOracle TimesTen Cloud Product Manager I now live in the Cloud, but I used to integrate with MVS, AS/400, Tuxedo, CORBA, SOAP, sockets and REST. I started using RDBMS with DEC Rdb/VMS and progressed to Oracle 5, 6, 7, 8i, 9i, 10g, 11g and 12c. I fell in love with Oracle TimesTen In-Memory Database as it is a really fast, simple and highly available RDBMS. I have worked as a consultant, developer and product manager at Oracle over the years. My technical interests are making things go fast [OCI, ODBC and PLSQL] and getting things to work together. I am a fan of Golang and I am looking for a good PowerPoint LLVM compiler ... I am now focused on Oracle TimesTen Velocity Scale. Velocity Scale is a shared nothing, scale out, In-Memory RDBMS based on TimesTen.\n\nhttps://developer.oracle.com/\nhttps://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/tryit"
