description: "Do More with Your Apps: Unleashing the Power of the Cloud Controller V3 API - Utako Ueda & Daniel Wendorf, Pivotal\n\nSome of the biggest problems developers have had with the Cloud Controller API have traditionally revolved around lifecycle management of their apps. The lack of features like version rollbacks, zero downtime deployment, running one-off tasks, simplified database migration, and running multiple processes per application have frustrated many developers. \n\nThe CAPI team is working on making all this and more possible with V3 of the cloud controller API. The new application modelling provides much more flexibility and control over the workflows available to you for application deployment. Many of these features are already available as pre-release/experimental APIs on recent versions of Cloud Foundry. \n\nUtako and Dan will explain how to take advantage of these (as well as some existing functionality you may not have seen before). This talk is targeted towards application developers at any experience level who would like to learn more about taking advantage of and building tooling using the Cloud Controller API V3. Attendees can expect a live demo showing real use cases for these features.\n\nUtako Ueda\nCloud Foundry\nUtako is a core contributor to the Cloud Controller API on the CF CAPI Team. She is a Pivotal CF software engineer with a background in physics. She is very excited about her escape from basement laboratories into the world of agile development and offices with windows.\n\nDaniel Wendorf\nDan is a consultant at Pivotal Labs who has been working with and on Cloud Foundry in multiple capacities since 2013. He is a core contributor to the Cloud Controller API."
