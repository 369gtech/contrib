description: "Building Images Efficiently and Securely on Kubernetes with BuildKit - Akihiro Suda, NTT Corporation \n\nBuildKit is a modern container image builder that focuses on efficiency and security, mostly known as the backend of Docker 18.06+ and Jessie Frazelle's `img`. (But it is even useful as a standalone tool!) In this talk, Akihiro Suda, one of founding maintainers of BuildKit, shows practical tips for running BuildKit on Kubernetes clusters. His talk will contain: * Quick introduction to BuildKit * Why you should build images on your Kubernetes cluster * Load balancing and distributed caching * Deployment w/ and w/o Kubernetes Service * Rootless mode w/ and w/o Kubernetes securityContext/PSP * Build secret management (e.g. git and S3 credentials) * Comparison with other image builder tools * Buildpacks integration * Knative integration \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPX5"
