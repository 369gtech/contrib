description: "“It is not necessary to change. Survival is not mandatory.” -W. Edwards Deming\n\nWork takes time to flow through an organization and ultimately be deployed to production where it captures value. It’s critical to reduce time-to-production. Software - for many organizations and industries - is a competitive advantage.\n\nMicroservices enable speed, but without safety is dangerous. In this talk we'll look at how to safely execute in standing up production worthy services, and how to address the complexity implied in building a distributed system.\n\nJosh Long is the Spring Developer Advocate on the Spring team at Pivotal. He is a Java Champion, a JavaOne rockstar, a blogger, and spends entirely too much time on Twitter. Josh is the lead-author on 5 books on Spring (including a new book from O'Reilly tentatively titled \"Building Microservices with Spring Boot\") and a new video training series - Building Microservices with Spring Boot Livelessons - from Addison-Wesley on using Spring and Cloud Foundry to build cloud-native applications.\n\n[WZG-2836]"
