description: "JUnit has influenced our way of working with tests significantly and is a fundamental cornerstone of modern techniques such as Test Driven Development. Now - after 10 years - a major version of JUnit is available for the first time: JUnit 5.\n\nOne of its main additions is the support for Java 8. JUnit 5 allows us to use Lambda expressions in assertions, making checking for exceptions much easier.\n\nAfter a short introduction of JUnit, its history and principles, we will explore its new features using concrete examples.\n\nGörge Albrecht develops software for 25 years. Since 2011 he supports large scale enterprises and small software companies as a code mentor. He helps developers to write simpler and thus better code in Java, Groovy and Smalltalk. His portfolio includes Test Driven Development, Clean Code, legacy code refactoring, Responsive Design, Flow Design, developer coaching and code audits. Görge publishes tips and tricks for software development in his blog http://code-mentor.com."
