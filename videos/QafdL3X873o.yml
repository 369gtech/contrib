description: "How would a global basic income system work? Is that even possible? Using recent advances in blockchain technology we can create a system that gives people a recurring income just for existing. This idea has been around for decades, but only now that we have the power to create global trustless systems can we detach the idea from the context of nation-states and into the context of distributed systems. I'll explain how 2 basic income coins, grant coin and circles work in this video. \n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/basic_income\n\nPlease Subscribe! And like. And comment.
