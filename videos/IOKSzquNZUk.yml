recordingDate: 1476820748
description: "Software embodies a large part of the technical and scientific knowledge that lies at the heart of our modern societies, and free and open source software constitutes the bulk of it. Communications, finance, transport, energy, health, entertainment, education, research, and politics have all come to depend heavily on software, which is a precious, essential, intangible asset.\n\nSoftware Heritageâ€™s mission is to collect, organize, preserve, and share the source code of all publicly available software. Roberto Di Cosmo surveys the motivations behind the launch of Software Heritage, which has already archived more than 3 billion unique source code files and 650 million unique commits, spanning more than 25 million FOSS projects from major software development hubs.\n\nEverybody can take part in this endeavor. Everybody should."
