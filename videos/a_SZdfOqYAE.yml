title: 'Péter Turi & László Üveges - Working development environment in 15 minutes'
recordingDate: 1557957263
description: "Since the foundation of the Development Experience team last year we had been working on improving microservice development practices in Prezi. The challenge is that some code, we are using in Prezi, is around 10 years old: we cannot expect all of it to work out of the box in a Kubernetes environment.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, we will not only be showing how a Prezilian makes their first change to a service in 15 minutes, but we will also cover what iterative approach we took on modernizing those \"old\" services thus reaching a uniform state. This uniformity of services, however, does not only mean that the setup of the development environment is fast. It improves developer efficiency by not having to deal with the different behavior of each service individually and also gives the platform teams the power to mass roll-out changes to all of our services. - Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/channel/5NYvjSCMHMD"
