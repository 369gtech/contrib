description: "Agile movement introduced a vast amount of innovative management tools. There are tons of textbooks available to readers that meticulously explain different Agile techniques and practices. What the textbooks often don’t tell is how difficult it is usually to apply a particular method in reality. In his talk Kiryl will share personal experience of applying Kanban in a constrained environment, which on the other hand is very typical in the world of vendor software development. He will try to connect theory from textbooks and real-life practice by showing how Kanban method had been implemented in a team that helped to build a huge product for a huge enterprise customer.\n\nKiryl Baraoshnik\nScrum Master and Agile Ambassador at EPAM Systems.
