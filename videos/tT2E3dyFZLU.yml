description: "It’s great that you’ve moved to microservices, but how are you distributing secrets? This talk offers an overview of Vault’s unique approach to secret management by providing secrets as a service for services (and humans), that is highly scalable and easily customizable to fit any environment.\nThis talk has two primary goals:\n\n1. Identify the new security challenges associated with using cloud technologies and microservices\n2. Showcase how the free and open source tool, Vault, can help reduce those security challenges\n\nTopics include:\n\n- Discussion of traditional security (perimeter security, firewalls, etc)\n- Identifying new challenges and solutions in cloud and microservices security\n- Describe Vault’s architecture and how it provides “secrets as a service”\n- Storing static secrets such as WiFi credentials\n- Generating dynamic secrets, such as database passwords or cloud credentials\n- Providing encryption as a service"
