description: 'In this 60-minute live presentation recorded at An Event Apart Denver 2017, “Adaptive Web Design” author Aaron Gustafson explores the ins and outs of page load performance by showing how he made the website of the 10K Apart meet its own contest rules—creating a site that was functional and attractive even without JavaScript, and was less than ten kilobytes at initial load. You’ll finish watching the video with a better understanding of the page load process as well as numerous ways you can improve the projects you’re working on right now.'
