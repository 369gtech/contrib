title: '[DevFest Nantes 2018] Optimize App Downloads with Android App Bundle and Dynamic Delivery'
language: French
recordingDate: 1540899163
description: "Speaker : Adarsh Fernando\n\nAn Android App Bundle is a new upload format that includes all your app’s compiled code and resources, but defers APK generation and signing to Google Play.\n\nGoogle Play’s new app serving model, called Dynamic Delivery, then uses your app bundle to generate and serve optimized APKs for each user’s device configuration, so they download only the code and resources they need to run your app. You no longer have to build, sign, and manage multiple APKs to support different devices, and users get smaller, more optimized downloads. Additionally, you can add dynamic feature modules to your app project and include them in your app bundle.\n\nIn this talk, we discuss how to configure your app to build app bundles and make the most out of Dynamic Delivery; use the Play Console to inspect and manage your app bundle; test your app bundle locally using bundletool and integrate these tests into you CI builds; and use the Play Core Library API to request, monitor, and manage on demand downloads."
