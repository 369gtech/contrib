description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2016\n—\nWant to get started compiling C++ code for the Web? Come to this session to learn how. We'll look at the tools, C++ libraries, and C++ OpenGL and SDL APIs, available to C++ programmers today, and walk through building and running a C++ application in Web browsers using WebAssembly, the new cross-browser standard for compiled code on the Web. \n\nWe'll also do an deep-dive tour through the entire system, starting from C++ code, through the compilation process to the WebAssembly binary format, and then to native code. We'll look at how to make C++ code interface with Web APIs and JavaScript, how both standalone C++ and hybrid applications are built, how WebAssembly delivers the kinds of performance characteristics C++ code expects while keeping users safe, and how C++ developers can make the most of WebAssembly's optimizations for fast download and startup times to deliver great experiences on the Web. \n\nLet's play some games, have some fun, and do some serious C++ on the Web!\n— \nDan Gohman\nMozilla\nWebAssembly. asm.js.
