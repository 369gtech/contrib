description: "Essential aspects of good API design influence the acceptance of your API and the success of your products. Learning through your own practical experience (while making mistakes) or gaining experience from others (who have already made mistakes, as this sessionâ€™s speaker did when designing NetBeans) is possible but takes time. There is, however, a simpler and more clueless way: follow an API design checklist. This presentation provides an introduction to 10 easy-to-answer questions and checkpoints that will guide you through the process of API design and ensure that your API satisfies all the aspects of good technology: it helps its users reduce their time to market, it lowers their total cost of ownership, and it is also cool enough to attract their attention.\n\n\nAuthor:\nJaroslav Tulach\nJaroslav Tulach is the founder and initial architect of NetBeans, which is not just a well known IDE, but also the first modular desktop application framework written in Java. \n\nJaroslav will share his API experiences while talking about API Design Checklist - a must have set of rules to follow by every programmer writing code that is consumed by another being.\n\nRegardless how revolutionary NetBeans architecture was at the end of last century, most of it is not slim enough to fit into small devices that rule the world today. NetBeans IDE (as it is) cannot fit into your phone or tablet. Still we want Java that is small enough to run on small devices, phones, plugin-less browsers and more. \n\nThe HTML+Java technology, as designed by Jaroslav fulfills that gap. It is a way to write business ready, yet slim applications once and deploy them everywhere!\nView more trainings by Jaroslav Tulach at https://www.parleys.com/author/jaroslav-tulach-1\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
