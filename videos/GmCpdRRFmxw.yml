description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nKubeFlow’s Serverless Component: 10x Faster, a 1/10 of the Effort - Orit Nissan-Messing, Iguazio \n\nServerless simplifies data science by automating the process of code to container and enables users to add instrumentation and auto-scaling with minimum overhead. However, serverless has many limitations involving performance, lack of concurrency, lack of GPU support, limited application patterns and limited debugging possibilities. Orit Nissan-Messing will introduce Nuclio, a KubeFlow open source component which is 10x faster when compared to alternatives at a 1/10 of the effort. She will explain how to use Nuclio to extend KubeFlow pipelines, accelerating and automating each step of the workflow. This includes parallel processing, automated code building/deployment, stream processing and artifact tracking. Orit will demonstrate how to achieve devops automation involving auto-scaling, automated logging and monitoring, security hardening, CI/CD and workload mobility. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UaaL"
