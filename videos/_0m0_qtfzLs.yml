Processes that communicate only by message passing makes building concurrent applications easy. It feels natural. We take it for granted.\n\nThe inventor of the Actor Model, Dr. Carl Hewitt, says that Erlang does not implement the Actor Model. Erlang co-creators Joe Armstrong and Robert Virding agree with Hewitt. Let's explore Actor Model wrongs & rights with BEAM languages compared to Pony (http://ponylang.io).\n\nRead the full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/scott-lystig-fritchie56/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - SCOTT LYSTIG FRITCHIE\nStuck in distributed systems tarpits for 30 years\n\nScott Lystig Fritchie was a UNIX systems administrator until he returned to programming full-time at Sendmail, Inc. While at Sendmail in 2000, a colleague introduced him to Erlang. His world hasn't been the same since. In addition to writing Erlang and occasionally C for the Erlang virtual machine, he has had papers published by USENIX, the Erlang User Conference, and the ACM and has given presentations at Erlang Factory, Code BEAM, and Ricon. Scott works at Wallaroo Labs on a polyglot distributed system of Pony, Python, and C.\n\n\nMore on Scott Lystig Fritchie: https://codesync.global/speaker/scott-lystig-fritchie56/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM STO 19\nCode BEAM STO is powered by Code Sync.
