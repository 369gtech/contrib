description: "UI should be simple to use, yet generic. We want to maintain consistent UX experience, yet be able to customize and extend. \n\nIn this talk, you’ll learn how we developed our consistent, fully-generic, easy-to-use and css-free UI components library, that spares our developers an enormous amount of time. It also allows them to avoid mistakes and most importantly, be happy."
