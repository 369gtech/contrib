title: '"Servo: Designing and Implementing a Parallel Browser" by Jack Moffitt'
language: English
recordingDate: 1614347536
description: "Servo is an experimental web browser engine for modern multi-core hardware. It is attempting to parallelize all parts of the web stack at a much finer level of granularity than is currently done in other browsers. Browser security is also incredibly important, so Servo is also being written in Rust, a new memory-safe systems programming language.\n\nI'll talk about Servo's goals, it's design, and how Rust helps in achieving these goals. I'll discuss where it is possible to get more parallelism in the browser, and some of the Servo team's ideas for achieving it.\n\nJack Moffitt\nMozilla\n@metajack\n\nJack Moffitt is a Senior Research Engineer at Mozilla Research and works on the Servo project. Previously he founded or worked at startups that created real-time search engines, mobile MMORPGs, and new communication systems. He also helped create Ogg Vorbis and founded the Xiph.org Foundation, a non-profit which works on open, royalty free multimedia codecs.\n\nRecorded at Strange Loop conference (https://thestrangeloop.com) in St. Louis, MO, Oct 2013."
