title: 'Self-healing in prod do you really need AI for that? (Yaroslav Molochko, Ukraine) [RU]'
recordingDate: 1577304565
description: "When you deal with production, idea of self-healing sounds really attractive, or maybe your VP is claiming that all his peers already doing AI, and we should do the same.\n\nDoesn’t matter what is the reason – but there are big chances that you don’t need AI/ML, did you consider “control theory” already? Do you already have closed loop controllers and PID-controllers?\n\nAfter the this talk you will get an idea of why AI is not really necessary, and in some cases it can even harm."
