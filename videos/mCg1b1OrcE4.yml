description: "This talk was recorded at CukenFest London 2019. For more information head to http://cukenfest.cucumber.io\n\nThose three little words. No, not those three, the other three: \n\n“Whole Team Quality”. \n\nWe know that successful agile teams live and breathe by this principle. But what does it actually mean in practice – and what does it definitely not mean? \n\nIn this keynote, I’ll look at techniques teams can use to evolve their testers and developers and to empower the team to (want to) be responsible for quality together – without suggesting that what we really need is just a great super role that can do everything. I’ll tell some stories about things that have and haven’t worked and I’ll address some of the questions and fears that come up when we talk about whole team quality."
