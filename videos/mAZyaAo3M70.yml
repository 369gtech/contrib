title: 'C++17 : The Biggest Traps - Nicolai Josuttis [C++ on Sea 2019]'
language: English
recordingDate: 1550246069
description: "https://cpponsea.uk\n\nC++17 is a huge combination of small new features both in the language and the library. These features have more poser but also more traps than you might expect. These traps are not theoretical. They already occur in real-world programming. This talk will list and discuss all these traps, explain the reasons for the underlying design, and give guidance how to deal with them. As a side effect you will learn a lot about some cool new features of C++17.\n---\nNicolai is an independent systems architect, technical manager, author, and consultant. He designs mid-sized and large software systems for the telecommunication, traffic, finance, and manufacturing industries. He is well known in the C++ Community for speaking and writing with authority about C++ (being the author of 'The C++ Standard Library', 'C++ Templates', and 'C++17 - The Complete Guide') but is also an innovative presenter. He is an active member of C++ standardization committee for more than 20 years now.\n\nhttps://cpponsea.uk/2019/sessions/cpp17-the-biggest-traps.html\n\nFilmed and Edited by Digital Medium Ltd: https://events.digital-medium.co.uk\nEnquiries: events@digital-medium.co.uk"
