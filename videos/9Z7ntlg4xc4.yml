title: 'Distribute Your App and Engage Your Community with a Helm Repository'
language: English
recordingDate: 1601026142
description: "With Helm charts moving from a central repository to a distributed format, it’s very important that open source projects move to their own repositories and make them discoverable to their communities.\n\nAttend this session to learn how you can create your own Helm chart repository, maintain it with best practices for keeping your charts up-to-date (ensuring that they work in any Kubernetes distribution), and help your intended users find them. We’ll finish with some ideas on how you can use your Helm repository to interact with your community, including by gathering and applying feedback from users.\n\nBy the end of this session, you’ll have the ability to create your own Helm repo, expose it to the world, and keep it maintained safely and securely for your users\n\nTomas Pizarro Moreno: Member of Technical Staff at VMware\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/distribute-your-app-and-engage-your-community-with-a-helm-repository"
