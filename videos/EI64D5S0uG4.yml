description: "Controlling Telescope Hardware with Rust by Ashley Hauck\n\nDive into hardware APIs as we explore how the hardware of an 8-inch aperture telescope can be controlled with Rust. In this talk, we'll explore using serial ports to drive complex motors and machinery, and using a native C API to download images from the camera and control the dozens of settings it has. As a bonus, learn some basics of astrophotography and see some pretty pictures I've taken with my telescope! All code is shared on github.\n\nCode: https://github.com/khyperia/scopie\nAshley's twitter: https://twitter.com/khyperia\nPictures taken with her telescope: https://khyperia.com/space.html\nAll raw data that she has taken: https://khyperia.com/space/"
