description: "Speaker : Alex Qin\n\nHow do perceptions and stereotypes affect those in software and on engineering teams?\n\nThis talk tells the true story of how I hacked my appearance, by shaving my head, to change the way I was perceived as a programmer.\n\nThis talk also serves as a primer on unconscious bias and stereotype threat, and their effects on individuals and teams. I will provide actionable advice on how to make engineering teams more inclusive, more diverse, and thusly more productive, successful, and attractive to potential hires."
