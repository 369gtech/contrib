title: 'Quantum Computing Exposed: Deep Dive by James Weaver and Johan Vos'
language: English
recordingDate: 1510225553
description: "The buzz about quantum computing has been rapidly increasing lately, and a growing number of developers have been looking into the subject. Concepts developers typically find challenging after cursory investigation of quantum computing include: superpositions of quantum bits (qubits), quantum gates, quantum entanglement (Einstein’s “spooky actions at a distance”), and the relevance of Schrödinger’s famous cat.\n\nIn this session, James Weaver and Dr. Johan Vos will give a thorough introduction to quantum computing, including: A brief history of quantum computing, visualizing superpositions, composing quantum algorithms with quantum gates, understanding Shor’s potentially RSA encryption busting algorithm, and current status of quantum computers.\n\n\n# Johan Vos \nJohan Vos started to work with Java in 1995.\n\nHe was part of the Blackdown team helping port Java to Linux. With LodgON, the company he co-founded, he is mainly working on Java based solutions for social networking software.\n\nBecause he can't make a choice between embedded development and enterprise development, his main focus is on end-to-end Java, combining the strengths of back-end systems and embedded devices. His favourite technologies are currently Java EE / Glassfish at the backend and JavaFX at the front-end.\n\nJohan is a Java Champion, a member of the BeJUG steering group, the Devoxx steering group and he is a JCP member. He is a co-author of the Pro JavaFX 2 book, and he has been a speaker at numerous conferences on Java.\n\n# James Weaver\nJames Weaver is a developer, author, and speaker with a passion for helping Java, Spring, and Cloud Foundry to be increasingly leveraged in cloud-native and machine learning applications. He is a Java Champion, and a JavaOne Rockstar. James has written books including Inside Java, Beginning J2EE, the Pro JavaFX series, and Java with Raspberry Pi. As an Pivotal Developer Advocate, James speaks internationally at software technology conferences. James tweets as @JavaFXpert, blogs at http://JavaFXpert.com and http://CulturedEar.com and may be reached at jweaver [at] pivotal.io"
