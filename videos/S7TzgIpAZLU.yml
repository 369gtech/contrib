description: "GoWayFest 4.0, Online – July11-12, 2020\n\nFace detection in Go and Webassembly, Endre Simo\n\nIn this talk I will discuss about Pigo, the only “pure” Go face detection library existing in the Go ecosystem which does not require any third party library and is platform agnostic. I will discuss about it’s integration into other programming languages and porting it to Webassembly.\n\nSlides – https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cSEa5ev_Jox9nnXJj6i6fZ-UD2rFPxsr/view?usp=sharing"
