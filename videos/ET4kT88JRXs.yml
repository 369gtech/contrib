description: "Filmed at https://2018.dotjs.io on November 9th in Paris. More talks on https://dotconferences.com/talks\n\nHow do you define and implement a static type system for a dynamic language like JavaScript, and why would you even care to? Anders explores how TypeScript came to be, how it differs from classic type systems, and how it can be beneficial even if you don't like types."
