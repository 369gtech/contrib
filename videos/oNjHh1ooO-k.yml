description: "You are making the thing: UI = the app. Users donâ€™t care about the complexity behind the scenes.\n\nMaybe most of the big decisions about what the application you're building should be, do, enable, perform etc have already been made.\n\nBut you can still have a big impact. Even, or especially when the big arc of functionality is already established.\n\nThe customer journey is the sum of all the interactions at all touch points"
