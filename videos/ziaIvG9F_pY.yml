description: "PyData DC 2018\n\nWithin the last few years, researchers have come to understand that machine learning systems may display discriminatory behavior with regards to certain protected characteristics, such as gender or race. As a result, many definitions of fairness have been created to enable equity in machine learning algorithms, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.\n\nSlides - https://speakerdeck.com/lejit/measures-and-mismeasures-of-algorithmic-fairness\n===\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
