description: "The availability of Lambda and streaming technologies such as Kinesis make it simple for anyone to build apps that scale to processing billions of API requests per month. We’ll explore some lessons learned and about the pitfalls and challenges one will face on their serverless ingestion journey.\n\nSome questions we’ll answer:\n\n- How does one cost-effectively operate such an API?\n- How do you pick data stores to handle this size of a data stream?\n- Where are the scaling pain points?\n- Why doesn’t everyone do this?\n\nWebsite: https://boston.serverlessdays.io"
