description: "Google Tech Talks\nFebruary 8, 2007\n\nABSTRACT\n\nI have implemented DialogDevil via three different user interfaces:\n\n   1. direct to Windows API via ctypes\n   2. wxPython, and\n   3. separate embedded html-based process.\n\nThe pros and cons of each approach from a developer's perspective will be discussed using metrics such as memory footprint, download size, flexibility, robustness, and visual styling.
