description: "Velocity is unlike any other technical conference on the planet.\n\nIt's an experience that will cause you to look at your work, the technologies you use, and your organization in completely new ways.\nIt's the conference where the big ideas around DevOps, web operations, web performance, and mobile explode into being. You'll hear from the best speakers in the industry. You'll take part in sessions that range from highly technical (hardcore math and statistics), to practical (demonstrations of monitoring, clustering, and analytics), to cultural (let's break down the silos and move ahead). Some will blow your mind.\nVelocity draws attendees from Fortune 500 companies to the newest, most exciting startups, all coming together for a legendary learning and networking experience.\nA faster, stronger web is no longer an option; it's an expectation. And that's just the beginning.\nJoin us September 15-17, 2014 at the New York Hilton Midtown, in New York, NY.\n\nDon't miss an upload!
