title: 'YOW! 2016 Rebecca Parsons - The Past and Future of Evolutionary Architecture'
recordingDate: 1483399987
description: "Evolutionary Architecture is rapidly becoming seen as the responsible approach to technology rather than some crazy idea that leads to chaos and despair. This talk follows the evolutionary path of Evolutionary Architecture first. We’ll then try to see where such ideas might lead us in the future.\n\nDr. Rebecca Parsons is the CTO at ThoughtWorks. She has more than 30 years’ experience in leading the creation of large-scale distributed, services based applications, and the integration of disparate systems.\n\nBefore ThoughtWorks, she worked as an assistant professor of computer science at the University of Central Florida, after completing a Director’s Post Doctoral Fellowship at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. Her interests include parallel and distributed computation, programming languages, domain specific languages, evolutionary architecture, genetic algorithms, and computational science.\n\nRebecca received a BS in Computer Science and Economics from Bradley University, and both an MS and Ph.D. in Computer Science from Rice University.\n\nFor more on YOW!
