language: English
recordingDate: 1464329721
description: 'WildFly (formerly JBoss AS) is an implementation of a Java EE 7 compliant application server. It is an open-source, community driven project with a goal of introducing the latest innovations with frequent releases. In my presentation I would like to give you an overview of the most interesting new features that we have recently implemented. Among others, I plan to tell you about the following topics: creating microservices using WildFly Swarm project, creating a lightweight server distribution using our new build tools, server side JavaScript with easy Java EE integration, Elytron - the new security framework, new ejb client library with simplified configuration and dynamic discovery, http/2 configuration, server graceful shutdown. Apart from that I will give you an overview of the recent changes in server internal implementation and what are their consequences from the user point of view.'
