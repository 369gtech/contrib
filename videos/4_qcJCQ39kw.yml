description: 'For whatever reasons you decided to build a service oriented system you will face many drawbacks of such an architecture. It is crucial to have a toolset that would help you in dealing with its drawbacks. Starting from centralized configuration management I will show how important and convenient is to keep all your configuration properties and files in a single place where all changes can be easily tracked and maintained and how to achieve that with Spring Cloud Config. Then I will give you some tips on how to configure Spring Boot Actuator to monitor your application state so it can be a source of information about the health of your system not only for developers but also for automated tools. Finally I will show how not to go insane when you need to find where failures occur or what causes poor performance in distributed systems by introducing distributed tracing to your system.'
