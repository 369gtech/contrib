For example, the Class Library project type now has a .NET Framework version (the standard one we are used to), a .NET Core version, a Portable version, and a .NET Standard version. The .NET Standard version has been tripping people up recently, so I decided to do a video explaining what it is, how to use it, and how it is different from the other project types.\n\nThis is mostly an informational video without a ton of demo. I show off some off the pitfalls and how to resolve them, but beyond that I mostly just explain the .NET Standard project type.\n\nThe website I showed off in the video is https://github.com/dotnet/standard/blob/master/docs/versions.md."
