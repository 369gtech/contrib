description: 'Everyone has heard at least once of the magical powers of machine learning - who wouldn''t want to be able to program a driverless car on its own? How many times, however, have you heard about the "dark sides" of data-driven technology? In this talk, we will show live demos of five aspects of deep learning that any developer should be aware of: (i) algorithmic bias; (ii) adversarial attacks on trained systems; (iii) breaches of privacy; (iv) safety threats; and (v) hidden technical debts. The lesson is: beware of blind reliance on deep learning - unless you are looking for "deep" troubles!'
