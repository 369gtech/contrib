description: "Erlang User Conference 2013\nMore info and slides on the website: http://www.erlang-factory.com/conference/ErlangUserConference2013/talks \n\nThis talk presents safetyvalve, yet another load regulation framework for Erlang. What makes safetyvalve stand out is an experiment: All code is derived from a QuickCheck specification. That is, the specification is written before the code is extended with functionality. And you are only allowed to extend the code when you know how to write the specification for it.\n\nSafetyvalve is also unique in that it contains a CoDel (Controlled Delay) queue management algorithm. This allows for self-tuning load regulation where the system adapts to the machine on which is runs, large or small.\n\nI claim that code derived from specifications results in smaller and more correct programs. I claim that it results in faster development. And I claim it is much more fun."
