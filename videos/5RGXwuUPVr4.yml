description: "Command Query Responsibility Segregation is a pattern which is used to manage impedance mismatch between how your application uses data and how the underlying store manages data so that transactional updates can be served with equal agility as read-only queries. From the functional paradigm prospective, the CQRS pattern can be seen as a set of referentially transparent functions that model decisions and interpretation. Moreover, with the event of micro-services and with the combination of the Actor model, the fundamental design of this pattern can dramatically simplify the overall architecture of your application. In this session, weâ€™ll look at the pros and cons to this approach to system architecture and design and how we can build an event driven system using a messaging framework/toolset like, but not only, Observables and Actors.\n\nDevConf 2017 (http://devconf.pl) \n13-15 September 2017"
