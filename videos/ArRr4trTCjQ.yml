description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2013\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nErik Stenman - Chief Erlang Wizard at Klarna\n\nABSTRACT\nWriting a 24/7 financial web services is quite hard. Writing scalable software is hard. Writing parallel programs is really hard. \n\nWith the right tool though, it gets easier. In this talk I will present the Erlang VM: Beam. Beam implements message passing, process isolation, dynamic code loading, garbage collection and preemptive scheduling. This make it easier to write scalable 24/7 services, and it makes parallel programming feasible. I will also talk about how we have used these features at Klarna to build a system that successfully has handled an exponential traffic growth for over eight years.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
