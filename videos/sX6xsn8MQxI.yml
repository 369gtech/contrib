description: "From Strata + Hadoop World 2015 in London: Mike Haley is the senior director, emerging products & technology at Autodesk. In his Strata+Hadoop keynote he shows how Autodesk's customers use it to bring life to their designs. \nVisit Strata Conference: http://strataconf.com\n\nRead Learning Autodesk AutoCAD: http://goo.gl/FMxSYk\n\nJet engines, lifelike movie monsters, cancer-fighting nanorobots, and bespoke products.\n\nWe live in a world where everything around us is designed by someone. The pace of innovation is escalating and with new methods of manufacturing, such as 3D printing, the demands placed on designers and design technology are increasing.\n\nWhat if there was a better way to organize all this information and allow ideas and creations to emerge more organically? We will explore how the design software of the future can emulate nature through the application of data science to 3D data. We introduce a geometric shape analysis and machine learning technology we call the Design Graph. By learning from millions of 3D models and then assembling a knowledge graph, it is able to react to a constantly-evolving world, guiding the designs of the future.\n\nAbout Mike Haley:\nMike leads the Emerging Products & Technology team at Autodesk where they identify, evaluate, and develop disruptive technologies that improve the practice of imagining, designing, and creating a better world. His team combines research, development, and user experience in coupled iterative cycles to develop new products and foundational technology. For the last several years Mikeâ€™s team has been focused on bringing geometric shape analysis and large scale machine learning techniques to 3D design information with the intent to make software a true partner in the design process.\n\nFormerly, Mike led the move of Autodesk products from the desktop to the cloud by driving the adoption of scalable distributed compute and data technology. Prior to joining Autodesk, Mike performed research and product development in the fields of volumetric graphics, distributed multimedia, computer vision, and embedded systems. He is drawn to areas where he can combine his 25 years of experience in computer graphics, distributed systems, and mathematical analysis. Mike holds an MS in computer science from the University of Cape Town, South Africa.\n\nSurbscribe on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/OreillyMedia\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/strataconf\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/OReilly\nGoogle+: https://plus.google.com/+oreillymedia"
