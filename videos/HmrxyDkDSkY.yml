description: "Speaker: Sandra Quelle, Creator of #HappyMondays, Founder of The Happy Mondays Co, ex-recruiter.\n\nSandra worked several years for top international recruitment firms across Europe and Asia, and earned recognition as a consultant. Then, in less than a year, she billed close to $800,000 for her company and positioned her newly-launched recruitment team as a top performer. \nDespite this, Sandra found something to be missing, and took a career break in 2015, which eventually led her to #HappyMondays and The Happy Mondays Co. \nHer clients describe her as a career hacker & a realistic-optimist. Her family and friends see her as as the happiest and most passionate career strategist.\n\nEvent Page: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/fuckup-nights-singapore-vol-xvi-tickets-34272425748\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/7hEn/"
