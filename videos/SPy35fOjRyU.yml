description: "\"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic\" - Arthur C. Clark\nGetting just the right combination of operators in an RxJS pipeline can seem like magic. But peek behind the curtain, and you'll see familiar patterns emerging.\nIn this talk, we'll examine four common RxJS pipelines for retrieving and processing data. We'll combine Subjects, creation functions, higher order mapping and combination operators to implement real world scenarios. By the end of this talk you'll wield the magical power of RxJS!\n\nng-conf is a multi-day Angular conference focused on delivering the highest quality training in the Angular JavaScript framework. 1000's of developers from across the globe join together to attend talks and workshops by the Angular team and other community experts.\n\nFollow us on twitter https://twitter.com/ngconfâ€‹ \nOfficial Website: https://www.ng-conf.org/"
