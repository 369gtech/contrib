recordingDate: 1476284165
description: "In part 3 of the Word Counting Coding Challenge, I implement an algorithm known as TF-IDF (Term Frequency â€“ Inverse Document Frequency).  The algorithm scores each word's relevance for a given document based on its frequency in one document relative to all others in a corpus.  This is one possible methods for keyword generation.\n\nhttp://shiffman.net/a2z/text-analysis/\n\nCourse url: http://shiffman.net/a2z/\n\nSupport this channel on Patreon: https://patreon.com/codingtrain\n\nSend me your questions and coding challenges!: https://github.com/CodingTrain/Rainbow-Topics\n\nContact: https://twitter.com/shiffman\n\nGitHub Repo with all the info for Programming from A to Z: https://github.com/shiffman/A2Z-F16\n\nLinks discussed in this video:\nITP from Tisch School of the Arts: https://tisch.nyu.edu/itp\nTD-IDF on Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf\n \nSource Code for the all Video Lessons: https://github.com/CodingTrain/Rainbow-Code\n\np5.js: https://p5js.org/\nProcessing: https://processing.org\n\nFor More Programming from A to Z videos: https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman/playlists?shelf_id=11&view=50&sort=dd\n\nFor More Coding Challenges: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZiZxtDDRCi6uhfTH4FilpH\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/XWYv/"
