description: 'Okay so in this lesson, what we want to do is to create a clone of pug starter from GitHub and then have it on our computer. Weâ€™ll follow up by resetting git, reinitialising it and then sending it back to the CodeTap Academy organisation in a new project where everybody else can fork it.'
