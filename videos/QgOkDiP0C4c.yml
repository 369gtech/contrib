description: "Jacob Gorm Hansen, Vertigo.ai\n \nCamera-based smart IoT sensors are soon going to be everywhere. The recent success of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has opened the door to a new computer vision and AI applications. While initial deployments are using high-end server class hardware with expensive and power-hungry GPUs, optimizations and algorithmic improvements will soon make running the inference side of DNNs on low-cost Edge Computing devices commonplace. These devices will need software, and this software needs to be continually updated, both to keep track with the rapid development within machine learning/AI methods and datasets, and to keep their operating system and middleware installs tamper-proof and secure. To this end, we have been building Mindcastle, a serverless distributed block storage system with strong cryptographic integrity, built-in compression, and incremental atomic updates. Mindcastle is based on a highly performant and flash friendly LSM-like data structure, first developed at Bromium where it served as the storage foundation Bromium's Xen-derived uXen hypervisor, and has hosted millions of strongly isolated Micro-VMs across many security-sensitive installations worldwide.\n\nView the full Vault '19 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/vault19/program"
