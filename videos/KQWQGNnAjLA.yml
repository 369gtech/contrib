description: 'I will share some experience on writing a software to play the game of Go in Kotlin. The game of Go is born in China more than 2000 years ago and despite its very simple rules is considered more complex than chess and so one of the most interesting from a software developer point of view. Until 2018 when AlphaGo beated the world champion, it was considered the humanity''s last stand. I''ll present a didactic go bot engine I developed in Kotlin. It''s very simple but it is already able to give interesting matches.'
