description: 'Building a minimum viable product in 3 months is easy. Scaling it towards a reactive system that can handle thousands of requests per second and deploying new versions without causing a denial of service is another challenge. Find out how at Crobox we scaled from a single machine (and point of failures) towards the high-available server cluster we are now running. On this journey you can also learn how we solved challenges with monitoring, logging and deployments.'
