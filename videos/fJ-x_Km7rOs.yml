description: "SOUPS 2021 - Using a Blocklist to Improve the Security of User Selection of Android Patterns\n\nCollins W. Munyendo and Miles Grant, The George Washington University; Philipp Markert, Ruhr University Bochum; Timothy J. Forman, United States Navy; Adam J. Aviv, The George Washington University\n\nAndroid patterns remain a popular method for unlocking smartphones, despite evidence suggesting that many users choose easily guessable patterns. In this paper, we explore the usage of blocklists to improve the security of user-chosen patterns by disallowing common patterns, a feature currently unavailable on Android but used by Apple during PIN selection. In a user study run on participants' smartphones (n = 1006), we tested 5 different blocklist sizes and compared them to a control treatment. We find that even the smallest blocklist (12 patterns) had benefits, reducing a simulated attacker's success rate after 30 guesses from 24 % to 20 %. The largest blocklist (581 patterns) reduced the percentage of correctly guessed patterns after 30 attempts down to only 2 %. In terms of usability, blocklists had limited negative impact on short-term recall rates and entry times, with reported SUS values indicating reasonable usability when selecting patterns in the presence of a blocklist. Based on our simulated attacker performance results for different blocklist sizes, we recommend blocking 100 patterns for a good balance between usability and security.\n\nView the full SOUPS 2021 Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/soups2021/technical-sessions"
