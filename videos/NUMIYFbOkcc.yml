description: "Developers building cloud-native applications come across the same challenges – reliable service invocation, state management, event-driven services, and observability to name a few. However, developers should focus on application business logic, not solving distributed application challenges. The distributed application runtime, Dapr (https://dapr.io​) is an open-source project that provides developers “building blocks” to solve common challenges when building portable, resilient scalable distributed applications. This session will show you how you can use these Dapr building blocks, and the extensive range of pluggable components, to efficiently build cloud-native applications deployed to Kubernetes and other hosting platforms.\n\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).
