description: "10 Lessons From Migrating to SPIFFE After 10 Years Of Service Identity at Square - Mat Byczkowski\n\nAt Square we have developed our own service identity system a few years ago that served us well in our datacenters, but as we increasingly started adopting the cloud, we decided to implement SPIFFE to provide seamless service identity system that would span many environments. In this talk I would like to briefly present how we built a migration process and what we learned from it.\n\nDon’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects."
