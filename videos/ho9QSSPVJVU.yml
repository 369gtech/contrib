title: 'Building reactive microservices with Vert.x 3.3 by Erwin de Gier'
language: English
recordingDate: 1492589899
description: "Vert.x is the reactive programming toolkit for the JVM. It provides a full stack environment for building microservices environments, using different JVM languages like Java, Groovy, Ruby and JavaScript. Due to its event driven nature, it enforces developers to think in components. It scaled beautifully, both horizontal and vertical. Vert.x is continually improving and the team is constantly adding new features. In this session we will look at the new features in Vert.x 3.3, which adds support for Service discovery, integration with Kubernetes, HTTP2 support and an implementation of the Circuit Breaker pattern. We also look at the future of Vert.x of version 3.4 and beyond.\n\nErwin de Gier is a Software Architect in the Sogeti Java Center of Excelence. He designs software solutions based on open source technology and helps teams getting started with their projects. Next to this he is a certified Scrum Master and trainer of several Java courses. He also supervises graduates during their final thesis. Erwin likes to share knowledge by giving workshops and presentations."
