title: 'Bruce Gray - "Refactoring and Readability"'
language: English
recordingDate: 1560867632
description: "Refactoring is:\n- worth practicing as a discrete skill\n- bound to an implied value judgement of \"better\" code\n- best served with a separate commit workflow\n- unsafe without automated testing\nReadability is:\n- crucial to code quality\n- best achieved by \"switching hats\" during refactoring\n- to be prioritized over premature optimization.\n- beneficial to more than just technical debt"
