description: "With JavaFX, Java made its comeback on the client. It has never been easier to create an application in Java and deploy it on desktop, mobile and tablet.\n\nIn this session, we show the current state of JavaFX on Android and iOS. We go through process of creating an application using a popular Java IDE, and deploy that application on different devices -- all from the same codebase.\n\nWe also demonstrate tools and libraries that make it easy to create cross-platform applications that still have a native mobile look and feel.\n\nJavaFX on Mobile is a community effort, using the Oracle's open-source code for JavaFX on Desktop. We will provide an overview of the eco-system with pointers to relevant providers of free and commercial tools and services."
