description: "Cloud Native platforms such as Kubernetes help developers to easily get started deploying and running their applications at scale. But as this access to compute starts to become ubiquitous, how you secure and maintain compliance standards in these environments becomes extremely important.\n\nIn this talk, we'll cover the basics of securing Cloud Native platforms such as Kubernetes. We will also cover open source tools - such as Clair, Anchore, and Sysdig Falco - that can be used to maintain a secure computing environment. Attendees will walk away with a good understanding of the challenges of securing a Cloud Native platform and practical advice on using open source tools as part of their security strategy.\n\nSpeakers\n\nMichael Ducy\nDirector of Community & Evangelism, Sysdig\nMichael Ducy currently works as Director of Community & Evangelism for Sysdig where he is responsible for growing adoption of Sysdig’s open source solutions.\n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
