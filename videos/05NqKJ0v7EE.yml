description: "Can we actually predict the price of Google stock based on a dataset of price history? Iâ€™ll answer that question by building a Python demo that uses an underutilized technique in financial market prediction, reinforcement learning. The specific technique we'll use in this video is a subset of RL called Q learning. Using a combination of code, animations, and theory i'll explain how we can let our AI learn a policy for when to buy and sell google stock to maximize profit. \n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/Reinforcement_Learning_for_Stock_Prediction\n\nPlease Subscribe!
