description: "From Zero to Mobile on Cloud Foundry in 8 Weeks: A Model for How It Is Done - Josh Davis, Platform Consulting Group & Frank Carrubba, MEDSiS International\n\nCreating a software solution from scratch that supports national governments and global healthcare organizations sounds challenging. And the idea of doing it in a mere eight weeks seems crazy! But our mission to transform a legacy process for the management of Vaccination Records across world populations was exactly the type of project that fits with today's digital transformation agendas.\n\nEquipped with a technology platform based on Cloud Foundry and Android, and leveraging modern software development techniques, our team was able to deliver a mobile Vaccine Management System that satisfies the latest United Nations and World Health Organization usability standards on-time and on-budget. With diverse requirements ranging from very critical security compliance to EU data rules to passport chip technology, this presentation will document our journey from idea to product in just weeks, while sharing our key learnings across all phases of the project, including our best practices for deploying and managing Cloud Foundry at pace.\n\nAbout Frank Carrubba\nThe Director of Software Development at Medsis, Frank Carrubba is a highly motivated United States Marine Corps veteran. He was recruited in 2016 to lead the global software development team at Medsis. His task is to create state of the art micro-service applications for the international market. Frank believes in a hands-on development approach and a lead from the front style of leadership akin to the Marine Corps. As an accomplished full-stack software engineer, Frank has found that there are specific advantages in using Cloud Foundry to envision, develop, and deploy mobile and web applications.\n\nAbout Joshua Davis\nJoshua Davis Born in New York City, Joshua began working for the Telecom and the Travel related industry while specializing in Object Oriented Programming in C++ with the Oracle toolset (PRO*C, PL/SQL, Forms, Reports, etc.).
