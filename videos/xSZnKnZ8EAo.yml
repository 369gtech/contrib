description: "Domain-Driven Design Europe 2018\nhttps://dddeurope.com/\nhttps://twitter.com/ddd_eu\n\nDomain Language throughout Tests, combining DDD and BDD\n\nWhile software engineers are beginning to use domain language more in their application code, in most tests we still see a lot of technical language. Especially when creating acceptance test for a gui, we mostly go from gherkin to selenium straight away! With the ever-growing culture of creating living documentation in the form of gherkin with Behaviour Driven Development (BDD), it is evenly important to use the domain language in our test code to.\n\nIn this talk, we first set the context of several types of tests, which will show you another model to use instead of the testing pyramid. I will use the OOPSI model, property-based testing and the Screenplay Pattern in this talk to refactor these tests. As a result, we have tests that are both useful for communication and serve as living documentation based on our domain language.\n\nBIOGRAPHY\n\nKenny Baas is a Software Engineer and Consultant focusing on software quality at Xebia. He mentors teams by using practices like Domain Driven Design, Behaviour Driven Development, Test Driven Development and Continuous Delivery.\n\nHe is an advocate for collaborating in open spaces. By using techniques such as Example Mapping and Event Storming, to engineer requirements and design of software along with business- and stakeholders.\n\nWith these methods, he aims to create a transparent collaborative domain space with constant and instant feedback of the software that is being built."
