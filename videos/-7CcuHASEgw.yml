title: '"Designing Augmented Reality Systems for Speed" by Diana Hu'

description: "Building Augmented Reality (AR) systems is a software engineering art. It requires making choices among a set of trade-offs. On one hand, you have complex computer vision and machine learning algorithms that burn many CPU cycles; and on the other hand, you have the conflicting goal of getting the system to be as lean as possible since AR runs on resource-limited hardware such as wearables or mobile devices. This talk will explore how designing AR software is very much like the problem of designing distributed systems.\n\nLike distributed systems, in AR: - We also need highly concurrent systems to take advantage of the many cores in cellphones. Concepts like message queues and \"producers-consumers\" become valuable tools to reason about computation abstractions on images and sensor data. - We also need highly available systems with an instant response due to the requirement of real-time interactions from the users with AR experiences. - We also need caching mechanisms to enable data locality for AR data retrieval.\n\nDiana Hu"
