title: '#FOSSBack: Danese Cooper - The Evolution of OSPOs'
recordingDate: 1614617935
description: "The concept of Open Source Program Offices or OSPOs is a familiar one within the corporate open source world. A growing number of governments, cities and universities have now also identified the benefits of OSPOs. However, public sector OSPOs tend to have a different set of priorities to Corporate OSPOs. While at Sun Microsystems, Danese Cooper set up one of the first OSPOs, just a few months after the term Open Source was coined. In this session, Danese will give an update on OSPO trends, explore how public sector OSPOs can differ from corporate OSPOs, and share how OSPOs can enable global collaboration to scale impact, and achieve public policy goals.\n\n\n###########\n\nFollow us on Social Media and join the Community!\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Fossbckstg\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/groups/8653059/​\n\nFOSS Backstage is an event by Plain Schwarz – https://plainschwarz.com"
