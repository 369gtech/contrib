description: "Running Kubernetes on Ephemeral Infrastructure - Greg DeArment & Vlad Ungureanu, Palantir Technologies \n\nPalantir runs millions of Kubernetes pods on thousands of nodes to power data platforms that, in turn, power the world's most important institutions. Palantir's infrastructure engineering team decided early in their Kubernetes journey to make infrastructure failure a feature of the deployment systems: every node gets destroyed and rebuilt every 48 hours, thus turning extraordinary events into daily routine. In this talk, Greg and Vlad present the reasoning behind implementing an ephemeral Kubernetes infrastructure, discuss the consequences for application architecture, and sketch solutions to the problems encountered along the way. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPYX"
