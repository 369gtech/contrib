language: English
recordingDate: 1510527602
description: "Petrol stations are dangerous places. Constant monitoring and analysis is crucial to ensure operation is safe and efficient on a daily basis. But the devices that monitor the stations are old and dumb where information needs to be pulled to be analysed.\nWell, we inverted that - and found interesting challenges to solve.\nFrom design and development of new hardware to the implementation of a new system providing real-time information about their petrol stations, I will tell you what it's like to be involved in a project with so many variables.\n\nCurious by nature and usually with a mug of coffee on his hands, Tarcio has over 15 years of experience designing and building software applications for a variety of industries, valuing the collaboration and learning from every project and firmly believes that quality is a mindset that can be taught and applied.\n\nFor more information on YOW!
