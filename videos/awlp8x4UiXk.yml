title: 'Build optimization mechanisms in Gitlab and Docker (Dmytro Patkovsky, Ukraine) [RU]'
recordingDate: 1577306330
description: 'For each tool, I’ll describe available optimization mechanisms that help to reduce build times. I’ll analyze their trade-offs, provide guidance on which & when to use, mention common pitfalls and workarounds. The talk is aimed at developers who already use Gitlab / Docker and want to learn lesser-known facts in order to achieve faster builds.'
