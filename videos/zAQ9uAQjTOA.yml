description: "Data is one of an organization’s most valuable assets. Because databases are the stores of that value, the perception of risk around loss or disruption is immense. The rate of change that can be taken for granted in the application development world is met with justifiable concern by those who are responsible for maintaining an organization’s data integrity. \n\nDespite being slower to adapt than their developer and even operations counterparts, there are emerging patterns that are bucking the trend. Attend this panel to hear more about these emerging patterns from:\n\n-Rachel Stephens, former DBA and analyst at RedMonk, who’s observing emerging databases and how data is valued in organizations\n-Elisabeth Hendrickson, VP of R&D at Pivotal, who’s brought years of test-driven development and agile experience to building data management products\n-Dormain Drewitz, Sr. Director at Pivotal, who’s noticing product management practices applied to how data sets are managed\n\nSpeakers:\nDormain Drewitz\nSenior Director, Product Marketing, Pivotal\n\nElisabeth Hendrickson\nVice President of Data R&D, Pivotal\n\nRachel Stephens\nRedMonk Analyst, Redmonk"
