title: 'Oracle Machine Learning for Python, with Demos'
language: English
recordingDate: 1578574964
description: "We learned about the Oracle Machine Learning for Python and how it integrates the advantages of Python with the scalability and performance of Oracle Database while enabling Python functionality on database data as if they were native Python objects. \n\nUsers transparently move from Python functions written for single core to overloaded functions leveraging database parallelism and scalability. Oracle Machine Learning for Python allows users to manipulate data in Oracle Database tables and views using Python syntax and functions, but translating Python functionality into SQL for in-database execution.\n\nUsers develop and operationalize comprehensive scripts for analytical applications without leaving the Python environment. Directly integrate user-defined Python scripts into applications and dashboards by immediately invoking Python scripts from SQL. This drastically reduces time-to-market by eliminating porting Python code and developing custom infrastructure, while enabling immediate updates to application code.\n\nThe Slides used in the presentation can be found in the Resources section below.\n\nVideo highlights:\n03:30 Oracle Machine Learning for Python Introduction\n06:50 Traditional Python and Database Interaction\n09:40 OML4Py Features\n13:20 Demo of OML4Py in Zeppelin Notebooks\n16:36 Demo of AutoML - Automatic Algorithm Selection\n20:44 Demo of  AutoML - Automatic Feature Selection\n22:32 Demo of AutoML - Automatic Hyperparameter Tuning\n26:55 Demo of In-Database Machine Learning algorithms\n35:30 Demo of Transparency Layer\n40:52 Demo of Overloaded Data Visualization functions\n45:05 Demo of Data Stores\n48:35 Demo of Embedded Python Execution\n55:58 Demo of Creating user-defined functions in the Python repository\n57:10 Demo of Scoring data and Building Models in parallel\n1:12:50 Demo of returning Images from Embedded Python execution\n1:15:40 Demo of SQL Developer creating and invoking Python scripts via SQL and PL/SQL \n1:18:08 Q&A\n\nAskTOM Office Hours offers free, monthly training and tips on how to make the most of Oracle Database, from Oracle product managers, developers and evangelists.\n\nhttps://asktom.oracle.com/\n\nOracle Developers portal: https://developer.oracle.com/\nSign up for an Oracle Cloud trial: https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/tryit"
