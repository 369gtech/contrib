title: '"How to Think about Parallel Programming: Not!" - Guy L. Steele Jr. (Strange Loop 2010)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1624298796
description: "Guy L. Steele Jr. believes that it should not be the programmerâ€™s job to think about parallelism, but languages should provide ways to transparently run tasks in parallel. This requires a new approach in building languages supporting algorithms built on independence and build-and-conquer principles rather than on linear decomposition of problems.\n\n\nSpeaker: Guy L. Steele Jr.\n\n\nGuy Steele is a Sun Fellow for Sun Microsystems Laboratories, working on the Programming Language Research project. He received his A.B. in applied mathematics from Harvard College (1975), and his S.M. and Ph.D. in computer science and artificial intelligence from MIT (1977 and 1980). Prior to joining Sun Microsystems, he was an assistant professor of computer science at Carnegie-Mellon University."
