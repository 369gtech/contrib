description: "Hendrik Ebbers\nSenior Software Architect\nKarakun AG\n\nBuild and testing a commercial software is easy. You can use a big infrastructure for CI and commercial tools to test your complete stack. And if you want to test your application on different mobile devices - well, that's easy! You company will buy them for you. But what can you do if you want to work on Open Source? You can not spend thousands of Dollars for a free time project... Imagine a world in that testing, building or deploying of open source software is as easy as for commercial projects. I will introduce you to this world and show several tools and services that will help you to get the best out of your open source project - without producing any costs but with a lot of fun, cool new technologies and the freedom of choose."
