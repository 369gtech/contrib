description: "Everyone is talking about microservices, cloud deployments, AI and other stuff that makes sense for IT people - but how did you get here? Even better question is - how new people are getting here, and how do they look? We are both working in business, but also working in university and teaching Applied Object Oriented programming (using .NET) and we believe that both students and business needs now are different, with a lot of focus going into creativity and life-long-learning areas in just about any field. In our course students are working in teams and creating innovative applications (using AI, Computer Vision) that does not exist yet - that creates close to working in business experience. In this session we will present how we are preparing students for IT world (and in wider sense – real) in Vilnius University. \n\nDONATAS KIMUTIS\n.NET developer, DanskeBank\nVYTAUTAS AŠERIS\nHead of Global Bussiness Unit, DanskeBank"
