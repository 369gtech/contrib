title: 'Math or Game Developers - Fast Inverse Square Root'
recordingDate: 1456430400
description: "In this video we examine the \"fast inverse square root\" method developed for Quake 3 Arena. It uses floating point format hacking and Newton's Method to implement a very fast inverse square root method, which can be used for finding normal vectors.\n\nCorrection: 2^-6 = 1/64 = 0.015625 not 0.000001 (I was confusing it with 10^-6).\n\nThe floating point format: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9mE-FfkIsY\nTaking a derivative: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kR1VvHREeE\nNewton's Method: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ge28Xb4B3rU\n\nFind the source code here: https://github.com/BSVino/MathForGameDevelopers/tree/numerical-fastinvsqrt\n\nNew video every Thursday.
