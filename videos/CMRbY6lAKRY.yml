recordingDate: 1519792579
description: "We live in a cloud-paced world in which developers use a plethora of programming languages, frameworks, and DevOps tools. Supporting such a fragmented development landscape, at the breakneck pace of innovation that the cloud allows, is no easy task. Come learn how the Developer Experience team of the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure group delivers and supports a variety of open source developer tools (Ruby, Python, Java SDKs, and CLI, to name a few) for a quickly growing set of cloud services without breaking a sweat. In this session, you’ll get valuable knowledge about how leveraging Swagger and the open source community can lead to huge productivity gains, whether you’re delivering a cloud, an app, or anything in between.\n\nJoe Levy\nPrincipal Technical Program Manager\nOracle\nJoe Levy owns Developer Experience for Oracle's Bare Metal Cloud Services team, and previously worked on Microsoft Azure's Automation service. He has expertise in a variety of programming languages, both client and server-side, as well as in reverse engineering and computer security. He is a graduate of Duke University, with a degree in Computer Science. When not in front of a computer, he likes to do pub trivia, wipe out going off jumps on his skis, and compete in hackathons.\n\nMathias Ricken\nPrincipal Member of Technical Staff\nOracle\nMathias Ricken is a Principal Member of Technical Staff on the SDK team for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. Before joining Oracle, Mathias was a senior engineer both at Amazon and Tableau. He has a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Rice University and is an amateur mountaineer."
