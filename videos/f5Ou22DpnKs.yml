description: "Presented at Reaktor Dev Day 2012\nReaktor Dev Day is a conference for developers by developers. Organized on Oct 19th in Helsinki, Finland it attracted over 300 enthusiastic developers. Topics included Haskell, Python, JavaScript, FP, Data security and Bacon.js.\n\nFor more information, please visit \nreaktordevday.fi/\nreaktor.fi/en/\n\nJavaScript is everywhere. In the browser, on the server and on your phone. It's impossible to avoid. But writing correct JavaScript is very hard. The language has many misfeatures, and common idioms encourage mutability, reducing the feasibility of reasoning about programs.\n\nThis talk will introduce the Roy language which is specifically designed to compile to JavaScript. It includes features to make JavaScript programs safer, such as immutability, static types, algebraic data types, type classes and first-class modules."
