description: "Build Complex Assignment Statements with a Stitch Action\n\nYou can incrementally build a message payload from one or more existing payloads with the stitch action. The stitch action provides an editor that enables you to assign values to variables. The stitch action supports scalar and complex type variables, arrays, and partial and full message payloads.\n\nIn this video, we will look at how to use the append operation in data stitch action. This operation appends at the end of the repeating/unbounded target element, the selected element, or the value. For example, you have an existing purchase order payload containing five lines and want to add a sixth line. The stitch action enables you to append a sixth line to the existing array of lines in the purchase order."
