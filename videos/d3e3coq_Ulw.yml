description: "Why should developers even care about buzzwords like 12-factor apps, cloud native, resilience, reactiveness or scalability? Why is it a good idea to integrate these concepts into our application in the year 2018? And which technology to we need to realize this? This session shows what it takes to implement cloud-ready, adaptive and scalable applications on containers and container orchestration. We will see modern Java Enterprise shipped in Docker containers orchestrated by Kubernetes running on a cloud service offering. The question of how to realize 12-factor and cloud native concerns, such as resilience, service discovery, or scalability will be answered. All of the time will be spent live-coding while explaining the concepts and solutions.\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
