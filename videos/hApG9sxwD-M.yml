title: 'Causal Inference made easy with Inverse Propensity Weighting /( Gerben Oostra, PyData TLV Oct 21)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1637622299
description: 'Machine learning is often used for predictive modelling, which predicts how a certain system will behave. But what we actually want to do, is to improve a system: for example by choosing which people to call, which discounts to give, or which products to recommend. This is not predictive, but prescriptive modelling. Using causal inference techniques one can predict how the system will behave when we change it, such that we can chose the best action. One causal inference technique is "Inverse Propensity Weighting". I''ll explain how it works and why it makes sense.'
