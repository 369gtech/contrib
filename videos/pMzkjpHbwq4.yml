description: "by Michael Hausenblas\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/H.2215/cloud_security.webm\n\n\nCloud native environments such as Kubernetes or AWS Lambda come with new challenges around security and in this talk we will review the environments and their properties, highlight common features and look at attack vectors and how to potentially reduce them. Cloud native environments such as Kubernetes or AWS Lambda come with new challenges around security: short-lived entities (containers, functions), untrusted environments/public clouds, high velocity, etc.. In this talk we will review the environments and their properties, highlight common features and table stakes (e.g., mutual TLS), and look at attack vectors and how to potentially reduce them. Focus areas are: managing confidential data in untrusted environments, container (image) and runtime security, Kubernetes control plane, as well as Function-as-a-Service execution isolation and considerations. \n\nRoom: H.2215 (Ferrer)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 18:20:00+01"
