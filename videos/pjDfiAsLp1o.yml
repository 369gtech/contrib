description: "Design for the entertainment industry should be, well, entertaining â€“ both when you are making it and when you are experiencing it. That means that whether its a logo, a title sequence or a website, the work should have that extra wink, or spark that helps surprise the audience as well as further the story. At the same time it is important to respect and nurture the relationships you have, with clients, with collaborators, and with other designers. (Besides making the work better, you never know where someone will end up or what something will turn into).\n\nEmily will discuss how this way of thinking started a chain reaction years ago that continues to help expand the breadth and depth of the work she does, while she continues to strive to create good/smart work for and with good/smart people, as often as possible.\n\nTo let people know that everything is connected and you never know where or when an opportunity will present itself, so pay attention!\n\nEmily Oberman\nPartner & Designer, Pentagram\nhttps://www.twitter.com/emilyoberman\nhttps://www.instagram.com/emilyoberman\n\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc\n\nSave 10% off any FITC event with discount code 'youtube'.\nSee our upcoming events at www.fitc.ca"
