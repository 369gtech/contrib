description: "This video was recorded at the virtual Lambda Days conference, which took place on 16-19th February 2021 - https://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2021\n\nMore great virtual tech conferences - https://codesync.global​ \n\n---\n\nTranslating Lambda Calculus into C++ Templates \nby Vít Šefl\n\nABSTRACT\nTemplate metaprogramming is an accidental feature of C++ that found its use in generic programming. However, writing metaprograms is error-prone and requires a great deal of boilerplate code. The talk explores how lambda calculus (and functional languages in general) can be used to address these problems.  \n\nOBJECTIVES: Present a new way of writing template metaprograms in C++ that is clear and concise and avoids confusing template compilation errors.\n\nAUDIENCE: C++ programmers interested in functional programming\n\n---\n\nSPEAKER - Vít Šefl\nPhD student researching typed FP \nVít Šefl is a PhD student at Charles University. The main topic of his research is lambda calculus and typed functional programming.\n\n---\n\nLambda Days\nWebsite: https://www.lambdadays.org​\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/LambdaDays​"
