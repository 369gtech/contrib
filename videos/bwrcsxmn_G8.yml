description: "How Our SREs Safeguard Nanosecond Performance—at Scale—in an Environment Built to Fail\n\nJillian Hawker, Optiver\n\nThe core principles of SRE—automation, error budgets, risk tolerance—are well described, but how can we apply these to a tightly regulated high-frequency trading environment in an increasingly competitive market? How do you maintain sufficient control of your environment while not blocking the innovation cycle? How do you balance efficiency with an environment where misconfigured components can result in huge losses, monetary or otherwise?\n\nFind out about our production environment at Optiver, how we deal with these challenges, and how we have applied (some of) the SRE principles to different areas of our systems.\n\nView the full SREcon21 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon21/program"
