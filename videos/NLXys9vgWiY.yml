description: "Join us for our next conference: https://goo.gl/B2bqQ6\n\nThe building built on stilts\n\nIn the summer of 1978, structural engineer William LeMessurier got a phone call that terrified him. An undergraduate student claimed that LeMessurier’s acclaimed 59-story Citicorp Center in Manhattan, just completed the year prior, was dangerously unstable under certain wind conditions. The student was right, and it was almost hurricane season.\n\nThe key to building a culture of innovation in your team is learning how to respond when mistakes inevitably happen. Let’s let Bill LeMessurier teach us how to respond when it all goes wrong so that our creations can thrive despite our mistakes.\n\nABOUT NICKOLAS MEANS\n\nNick hails from Austin, TX, the Taco Capital of the World. When he’s not busy eating tacos, he’s the VP of Engineering at Muve Health, working with an incredibly talented team of developers to change how healthcare is delivered and paid for in the US. He’s a huge believer that software development is mostly human interaction and that empathy is the key to building great software.\n\n---\n\nWhen you’re busy leading a team, coding and maintaining standards, how do you find the time to stay ahead of new technologies and develop yourself as a technical lead?\n\nThe Lead Developer conference features practical advice from experts on leading and motivating your team and high-level sessions on new and disruptive technologies.\n\nGet tickets at theleaddeveloper.com"
