description: "Never been to an FITC event? We'd like to change that. Just email us at neverbeen@fitc.ca for a VERY special offer!\n\nLight is a particle and a wave and carries both data and information. There are many more applications than just backlighting the grid of pixels on a smartphone. Join Jared to explore a whole lot of interesting applications for the many forms of light. From carrier waves to projection the session will cover lots of applications from using infrared LED to horizontal projection.\n\nHe will examine using projected light as a computing interface. Talk about how open naked light taps into a primal area of the mind and breaks free from the constraints of a rectangle. We will also talk about how light beyond the range of human vision can create hidden channels that can be used to create the kind of technology that has the appearance of magic. This session is equal parts practicality, creativity & exploration.\n\nJared Ficklin\nChief Creative Technologist, argodesign\nhttps://twitter.com/jaredrawk\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
