description: "From Shodan to Certificate Transparency, it is easier than ever to use TLS certificates for DNS hostname reconnaissance. However, these sources of data are either not free, infrequently updated or are not linked to a server IP address. This talk will survey existing resources & release a new, free service for finding TLS certificates in the IPv4 space!\n\nSam Erb (Twitter: @erbbysam) is a 2x black badge winner with Co9 in the Badge Challenge and is working to make the Internet a safer place."
