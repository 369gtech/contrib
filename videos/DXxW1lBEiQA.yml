recordingDate: 1515769984
description: 'During last several years DevOps became strong buzzword used almost in every project, team and company. But almost everywhere it is used in very funny and strange context. For example, existing ops guys are renamed to DevOps just to sell them to the client for more money. Or DevOps is used as new job title for some magically powerful person who is able to operate cloud environment and modern infrastructure related tools, leading team of old school ops and participating in management meetings. In this talk Iâ€™m going to review all different anti-patterns and bad practices in DevOps landscape using stories from my personal experience as Delivery Manager and independent consultant.'
