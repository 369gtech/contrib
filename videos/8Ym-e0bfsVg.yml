description: 'Green IT and Pivotal CF - FjordIT believes that the global IT industry must find ways to scale and grow while using and reusing resources efficiently enough to reduce emissions. Its unique virtual data center product, Green Data Power, today includes Pivotal CF as its platform offering, enabling customers to create new online services very quickly, delivering them with stability in a cost-effective way. According to Helge Gallefoss, CEO and Founder, Pivotal CF was the right choice for platform as a service, which is much more efficient that creating the whole stack and dealing with hardware, virtualization, configuration of services, operating systems and more.'
