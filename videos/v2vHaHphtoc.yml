description: "Speaker: Maciej Piotrowski\r\n\r\nMaciej will share on his topic \"Review all the things!\": I have a vision, where unit testing and code review are a standard, not an opt-in feature in iOS development. I've been fighting a lot to introduce them at my workplace. Let me tell you what things get reviewed in other industries and why it is so. Join the talk if you want to start code review practices at your company, but you don't know how to kick it off.\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/Singapore-iOS-Dev-Scout-Meetup/events/242343633/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/9rBu/"
