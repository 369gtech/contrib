description: "Mario Torre\nAssociate Manager, OpenJDK Group\nRed Hat\n\nOracle has worked hard over recent years to help transform OpenJDK from an open source project managed and implemented for the most part from within their company to a healthy and diverse community project with multiple contributors capable of driving features and innovations. The recent open sourcing of JDK Mission Control and JDK Flight Recorder has contributed the last remaining major feature set that distinguished their proprietary releases of Java from OpenJDK. All these efforts have made OpenJDK more relevant today than ever as the reference implementation of Java, the 'One Source Code To Rule Them All'. In this presentation we will present the open sourcing of JMC as one example application of the projectâ€™s open governance model to a shared, community endeavour. Project details, including how it can be used, the principal features and the APIs and explore some of the use cases, with a primary focus on how everything is being planned and executed in the open, accessible to everyone."
