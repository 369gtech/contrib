description: "Continuous Delivery takes Agile to its logical conclusion with a way of working that ensures software is always ready to release. It does this by building upon and extending Agile, CI and DevOps practices and tools to transform the way software is delivered. \n\nOrganizations that want to adopt Continuous Delivery need frequent check-ins to be verified by automated builds and tests so teams can reduce risk, deploy more often, and detect problems early. \n\nThis talk will focus on the ElectricFlow DevOps automation platform, and the functionality it exposes to:\n- Enable Devs to automate complex build and test processes to drive efficient predictability at scale\n- Give Ops teams a way to eliminate manual and error-prone processes to safely deploy any applications anywhere, anytime.\n- Any teams to securely plug-in the clouds and tools they care about to abstract out complexity and ensure process compliance"
