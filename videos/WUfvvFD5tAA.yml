title: 'IA Memory Ordering'
recordingDate: 1204282098
description: "Google Tech Talks\nFebruary, 28 2008\n\nABSTRACT\n\nIntel recently published more precise memory ordering principles for the\nIA32 and Intel Architecture 64 (aka x86) processors. This talk discusses\nthe key principles embodied in this memory ordering and explains some of\nthe software driven motivation behind them. Along the way we discuss\nissues such as publication safety and how to use the principles to\nimplement the memory models found in high level programming languages.\nThe presentation is aimed at developers of concurrent shared memory\nsoftware and will provide a presentation of the principles as well as\nguidance on how to reason about them.\n\nThis is joint work with Bratin Saha and many others both inside as well\nas outside Intel.\n\nSpeaker: Richard L. Hudson\nRichard L. Hudson is best known for his work in memory management\nincluding the invention of both the Train Algorithm and the Sapphire\nAlgorithm. Richard joined Intel in 1998 where he has worked on memory\nmanagement, concurrency, synchronization, and memory model related issues. He went to Shortridge, holds a B.A. degree from Hampshire College and an M.S. degree from the University of Massachusetts."
