description: "A Deep Dive into Modernization Patterns to Get Your Mission Critical Applications to the Cloud - Shaun Anderson, Pivotal\n\n Shaun will be taking you through several of the most common patterns he and his colleagues have compiled from experience on more than 45 modernization projects. These technical patterns were driven out by the desire to strangle business critical functionality out of legacy monoliths and push to the cloud without impacting current business flow. These patterns can be used to move functionality to the cloud in days and weeks rather than months and years.\n\nPattern Categories include:\n\n* Strangling the Monolith\n* Event Shunting\n* Proxies / Facades / Adapters\n* Gateways \n\nAbout Shaun Anderson\nShaun is an Application Transformation Practice Lead at Pivotal. He spends most of his time slaying, starving and strangling monoliths and defining pragmatic solutions to complicated problems. He has a wealth of experience designing and building mission critical applications with technologies running the gamut from Akka to Zuul. He is the inventor of top down domain oriented design techniques including the Boris Diagram. Shaun also contributed to the curriculum and taught the replatforming and modernization sections of Pivotalâ€™s Platform Acceleration Lab. His specialties are distributed computing and transforming mission critical Java applications into Cloud Native applications. Shaun has recently presented at the SpringOne Conference, has participated in webinars and podcasts."
