title: 'Machine Learning Exposed: Introduction to Machine Learning by James Weaver and Katharine Beaumont'
language: English
recordingDate: 1494596058
description: "In the age of quantum computing, computer chip implants and artificial intelligence, it’s easy to feel left behind. For example, the term \"machine learning\" is increasingly bandied about in corporate settings and cocktail parties, but what is it, really?\n\nIn this session, James Weaver and Katharine Beaumont will give a gentle introduction to machine learning topics such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, and deep learning. We'll also survey various machine learning APIs and platforms. We’ll give you an overview of what you can achieve, as well as an intuition on the maths behind machine learning.\n\nThe presenters are very aware that some material on machine learning can be maths-intensive, and off-putting if you are not confident with your calculus. Conversely, some material doesn’t go into enough detail so you don’t get a feel for how things actually work. We aim to give the session we wish we’d attended at the start of our journey: We will start right at the beginning with the basics, and build up in an approachable way to some of the most interesting techniques so you can get the most out of your machine learning adventure."
