description: 'Test-Driven Development is about writing a test first, then the code that satisfies the test. Or... is it? Classic TDD has been crucial in my growth as a developer; and yet, as I started using F# more and C# less, my coding practices have evolved dramatically. Nowadays, I barely test first, but spend my days in the scripting environment. In this talk, I will examine how I write code in F# today, in a style I consider very much inspired by TDD; I will also discuss how exploring two paradigms (C# and F#) forced me to re-examine my beliefs, and evolve a slightly different (and perhaps less language specific) undertanding of some of the same core principles.'
