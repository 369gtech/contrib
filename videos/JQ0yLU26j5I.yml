recordingDate: 1446772238
description: "Ed Bellis, CTO, Kenna and Former CISO, Orbitz\n\nLetâ€™s face it, security is hard work. Heavily automated DevOps environments introduce both new strategies and new challenges, and organizations need to identify ways to innovate while ensuring information security. Programmable infrastructure is one such method of creating efficiency, repeatability and speed while implementing and enforcing security policy. Drawing from firsthand experiences, this talk will walk through the advantages of treating security policy as code and why automation is the key to scaling security. The final product of this session will be an open source end-to-end demonstration and shared cookbooks to jumpstart injecting security into the DevOps enterprise."
