In order to make each microservice resilient and elastic in and of itself, we have to design each individual microservice as a distributed system—a «microsystem»—architected from the ground up using the reactive principles.\n\nThis presentation was recorded at QCon London 2017. The next QCon is in London, March 5-7, 2018.
