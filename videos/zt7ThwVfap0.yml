description: "http://www.Cppcon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2015\n—\nfunctional gained lots of machinery in C++11, with further changes in C++14 and C++17. This talk will cover what's new in 11/14/17, focusing on how to use it properly. For example, you've probably used std::function, but do you know the criteria for activating the Small Functor Optimization? (It's not just being small!) We'll also look at bind(), mem_fn(), C++17's invoke(), and more.\n— \nStephan T. Lavavej is a Senior Developer at Microsoft. Since 2007, he's worked with Dinkumware to maintain Visual C++'s implementation of the C++ Standard Library. He also designed a couple of C++14 features: make_unique and the transparent operator functors. He likes his initials (which people can actually spell) and cats (although he doesn't own any).\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
