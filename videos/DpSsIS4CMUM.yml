title: 'ElixirConf 2019 - Elixirbridge Lessons Learned from Building Community - Anna Neyzberg'
recordingDate: 1567112168
description: "Several years ago, we started ElixirBridge with the hope of helping bring more folks that are underrepresented into the elixir community. The goal was to help build a more diverse and inclusive community.\n\nNow we want to share lessons learned, both positive and negative, that we believe are crucial to keeping in mind to successfully build community.\n\nThe hope is that folks walk away from this talk with knowledge of what has worked, what has not, and some useful tools to bring back to their communities."
