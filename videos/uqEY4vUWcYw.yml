description: "At OSCON 2013, Dave Neary (Red Hat) presented; How do you grow the next generation of hackers? New little humans are clean slates. As parents, we get to fill them full of seditious thoughts about the value of sharing and taking control of your environment.\n\nAs a parent of three kids, now 10, 7 and 5 years old, I've worked my way through the challenges of getting my kids enthusiastic about technology while avoiding the temptation of doing too much, too soon. This is one parent's story of bringing his kids from pre-school construction toys through to building a solar powered Arduino-driven car built in part with components scavenged from old electronic toys.\n\nCome and hear lessons learned, get ideas for toys and approaches you might not be aware of, and please share what has worked for you!\n\nDon't miss an upload!
