description: "Watch more from the O'Reilly Software Architecture Conference: http://goo.gl/lXpXnG\n\nThere is a common misconception that architecture is thrown out the window when a team or organization is developing software in an agile fashion, but where does this myth stem from? Surely, there is some truth behind this thinking. We’ll talk about some of the underlying assumptions that support this belief in order to build a common understanding of what it really means to be developing in an agile fashion. During the second half of this talk, we’ll move from the conceptual thinking into some practical suggestions from our experiences — what we’ve seen that works and highlight some practices to avoid. In the end, the audience will know how to bring architectural thinking into teams to support the higher level goals of application architecture.\n\nAbout Molly Dishman (ThoughtWorks):\nMolly Dishman is a Senior Consultant at ThoughtWorks Inc. a global IT Software Consultancy.

It's also a fast-moving discipline, where entire suites of best practices become obsolete overnight.\n\nThe O'Reilly Software Architecture Conference is a new event designed to provide the necessary professional training that software architects and aspiring software architects need to succeed. A unique event, it covers the full scope of a software architect's job, from IT to leadership and business skills. It also provides a forum for networking and hearing what other professionals have learned in real-world experiences.\n\nStay Connected to O'Reilly Media by Email - http://goo.gl/YZSWbO\nFollow O'Reilly Media:\nhttp://plus.google.com/+oreillymedia\nhttps://www.facebook.com/OReilly\nhttps://twitter.com/OReillyMedia"
