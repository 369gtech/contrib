title: 'Congratulations, You''re an Architect - Stephen Kennedy'
recordingDate: 1506326680
description: "So you, or your workplace, identifies you as an architect, what now?\nThere are countless amounts of available material on software architecture and design patterns, but comparatively little on how to be a software architect. Being an effective architect is a whole lot more than having a toolkit of patterns and practices!\n\nIn this talk Stephen will draw upon his years of experience working on architectural solutions and mentoring others. Among other things, this talk will cover:\n\n• Attitudes and behaviours\n• Getting your way\n• Gaining the respect of the business\n• Considerations outside those of a developer\n\nThis talk is for practitioners from those early in their software architecture foray, to those just seeking some group therapy.\nNo UML diagrams, guaranteed!"
