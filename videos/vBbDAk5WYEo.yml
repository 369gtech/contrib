language: English
recordingDate: 1437602901
description: "From OSCON 2015 in Portland: Ship a lot, or ship fast? These goals may seem to be at odds, but it’s actually possible to have large, diverse portfolios of open source projects and maintain a fast-moving, iterative approach. In this talk, Facebook’s open source lead James Pearce will discuss how Facebook is able to ship open source products twice a week and maintain quality, size, and speed. The audience will also hear about how Facebook’s open sourcing projects are integral to its own operation, which makes open sourcing products at scale possible. Any company, whether it has 15 people or 15,000, can run a successful open source program at scale.\n\nAbout James Pearce:\nJames manages the open source program at Facebook. He’s a developer and writer with a special passion for the web, mobile platforms of all sorts, and helping developers explore their potential.\n\nJames’ mobile projects include confess.js, WhitherApps, tinySrc, ready.mobi, Device Atlas, and mobiForge. Previously at Sencha, dotMobi, Argogroup and Ernst & Young, he has also written books on the mobile web for Wrox & Wiley.
