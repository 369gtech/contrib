recordingDate: 1441463556
description: 'DevOps has been a hot topic in the industry for some time now. A lot of people been talking about it. Some have built business models around DevOps-related tools and themes. There are even conferences and trade shows dedicated to DevOps-oriented things. People have made career around talking about it. In light of all of that, I find it chuckle-worthy that very few people actually know what DevOps is. So instead of trying to create a buzzword-infested definition of DevOps to suit my particular agenda, Iâ€™d like to talk about what DevOps is not.'
