description: "https://aka.ms/IoTShow/process-manufacturing\n\nEnterprises nowadays are looking for ways to become more efficient by utilizing IoT to minimize safety incidents and maximize the lifespan of their assets. In this episode we will discuss a real-life scenario from process manufacturing. Let's look at a real life scenario: with the use of non-intrusive LoRa sensors and Azure IoT, we calculate the flow regime inside industrial pipes and gain insights about the remaining useful life of the asset, while lowering the exposure risk of field engineers.\n\nRead about IoT in Process Manufacturing: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/iot/industry/process-manufacturing/ \nExperiment with the Azure IoT Edge LoRaWAN starter kit: https://github.com/Azure/iotedge-lorawan-starterkit\nLearn about Azure Stream Analytics: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/stream-analytics/"
