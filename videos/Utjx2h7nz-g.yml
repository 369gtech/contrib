description: "Thomas Cuthbert\nhttp://linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/86/\nPerl and Expect are great tools to ‹strike›destroy‹/strike› automate your network of tens of devices. But what if we wanted to ‹strike›annihilate‹/strike› manage hundreds or even thousands of routers and switches sprawled across slow and lossy WANs or spanning multiple DC fabrics?\r\n\r\nIn this talk I'm going to arm you with the greatest weapon in the fight against ‹strike›availability‹/strike› network management. This weapon is Trigger.\r\n\r\nTrigger is a python API for managing network devices. Trigger is built on top of Twisted which means it ‹strike›nukes‹/strike› moves really fast. Trigger provides easy to use classes and functions to manage Cisco (and many Cisco like devices), Juniper and Arista routers and switches over SSH.\r\n\r\nAfter the session you will be locked and loaded for combat in the fight against network configuration management."
