description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nPractical Way to Build Kubernetes Native Java Controller - Zibo He & Min Jin, Ant Financial \n\nThe controller pattern has been proven as an effective way for managing Kubernetes workloads. However, for other languages, there are still many challenges remained in developing third-party controllers for Kubernetes. In this talk, we will discuss how to implement reflector, internal store, working queue and leader election in native Java style, and demonstrate controller runtime that makes it easier to develop Java controllers from scratch. We will also discuss different operators that we build to integrate with micro-service framework for cloud native application development. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UacE"
