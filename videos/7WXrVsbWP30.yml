description: "As multithreading experts joke, programmers are divided into two types: first ones donâ€™t know anything about concurrency programming and second ones THINK they know something. :)\n\nI think that a majority of JEEConf participants wrote multithreaded code, at least, once. Among this majority, almost all people know what is deadlock. And many of these people know how to fight with deadlocks.\n\nOr they just THINK they know it?\n\nIn my talk I consider the classical problem of Dining Philosophers. We will consider different solutions of it (implemented in Java) and see what are the dangers of each of them."
