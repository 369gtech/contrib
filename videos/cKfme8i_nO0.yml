description: 'Nikolay gave the story of the Sofia University Elixir course. How the idea came to him, how he and his partners from elixir-lang.bg created it, how they attracted students (it is an elective course). It also discusses what they talked about, ideas on how to create exams and mark work, the sources used and what were the hardest things for them to achieve.'
