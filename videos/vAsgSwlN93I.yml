language: English
recordingDate: 1621556332
description: "The web community is entering into a new era of responsive design and shifting our perspectives on what it means. With user preference queries, container queries, and other form-factor queries on the horizon, we'll soon have the tools to create responsive designs far beyond what querying the global viewport allows. This Session highlights what it means to be responsive to the user, container, and form-factor, along with how to implement some of these new axes of responsive design.\n\nSpeaker: Una Kravets\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).
