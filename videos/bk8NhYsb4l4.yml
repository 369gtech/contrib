description: "# (Talk 1) Rosana de Oliveira Gomes: ATHENA Art Assistant - Women & AI Creations\n\nThe world of arts is still highly male-dominated. Although half of the art students are women, still close to 90% of artwork promoted in exhibitions are from white male artists. The ATHENA Art Assistant is an open source initiative created during the SAAI Hackathon to address the women representation problem in arts. This assistant has multiple AI-driven functionalities, all fed with data exclusively from the artwork of female artists. The prototype has a recommendation system feature that recommends and TV shows movies from women directors and screenwriters, to promote their work.\n\n# (Talk 2) Oluwatoyin Yetunde Sanni: Hyper parameter tuning with Deep learning\n\nSummary: Machine learning models can be extremely powerful. However, they are notoriously hard to optimize for any given problem. There are just too many variables that we could change. Some include the right dense unit, CNN layers, number of filters or kernel size, learning rate and many more.\nCan we automate a search that can perfectly do this for us? We will explore two libraries that can help us do this.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R."
