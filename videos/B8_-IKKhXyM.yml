description: "Security education for developers needs to be modernized to defend against modern threatsâ€”it doesn't work if it doesn't fundamentally change their thinking. How do you shift left on security without sacrificing the safety of your product?\n\nCloud Foundry's strength is the resilient and ever-changing open-source community behind it. This community has successfully brought measurable, impactful security changes into the platform. But the security of your product will reflect the security posture of your organization.\n\nParticipants will learn new techniques to coach individuals to think about security in a different way, how they can fit into a larger organization, and how to implement them at scale across development teams.\n\nLearn more: https://pv.tl/2JeC75d\n\nSpeakers: Molly Crowther, Staff Technical Program Manager, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2019\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/human-factors-in-security-toward-securityconscious-development"
