description: "Saving Human Lives with the IoT - Dat Tran, Pivotal\n\nNearly 1.2 million people die in road crashes each year (WHO - 2015) with additional millions becoming injured or disabled. One big part of this problem is worst road traffic conditions and unless action is taken, road traffic injuries are predicted to become the fifth leading cause of death by 2030. Moreover, although road traffic injuries have been a major cause of mortality for many years, most traffic accidents are both predictable and preventable. In this talk, we want to demonstrate a scalable IoT platform that uses weather data and data from other cars to warn drivers of dangerous conditions. We will show how CF can help to save human lives and the architecture behind this. Additionally, we will also explain the data science that is involved.\n\nAbout Dat Tran\nDat Tran is a Data Scientist at Pivotal Labs where he mainly focuses on helping clients to understand their data and accordingly how it can be used to add value. To do so, he employs a wide range of machine learning algorithms, statistics and open-source tools to solve his clientsâ€™ problems. Previously, he was a member of the advanced analytics team at Accenture where he also accompanied various clients across different industries during their journey to become a data-driven enterprise. Dat has a background in Operations Research and Econometrics and received his MSc in Economics from Humboldt University of Berlin."
