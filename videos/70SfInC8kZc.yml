title: '2019 - Maciej Prochniak - Being transactional in 2019 - what does this actually mean?'
language: Polish
recordingDate: 1573930668
description: 'When I was young and took my CS classes I learned about ACID and it seemed sound and reasonable. Then I went to work and learned that it could mean different things (especially isolation…) for different database vendors… Around 2009 I’ve heard about CAP theorem - that was also sound and quite reasonable in the brave, new distributed world. And then one after another - NoSQL vendors started to claim they’ve beaten CAP theorem (* as they understand it of course…) And recently it got even more complex - stream processing engine have their notion of transactions - atomicity, isolation and so on. In this talk I will try to make something out of this mess - we’ll look at some of definitions and try to figure out which use case require particular kind of isolation or transactionality. Of course quite a lot will be based on my own experience - including quite a lot of blood, sweat and tears ;)'
