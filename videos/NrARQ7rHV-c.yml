description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2016\n—\nDeveloping a large-scale software system in C++ requires more than just a sound understanding of the logical design issues covered in most books on C++ programming. To be successful, one also needs a grasp of physical design concepts that, while closely tied to the technical aspects of development, include a dimension with which even expert software developers may have little or no experience. In this talk we begin by briefly reviewing the basics of physical design. We then present a variety of levelization and Insulation techniques, and apply them in present-day, real-word examples to avoid cyclic, excessive, or otherwise inappropriate dependencies. Along the way, we comment on how to make the best use of what the C++ language has to offer.\n— \nJohn Lakos\nBloomberg LP\nSoftware Infrastructure Manager\nJohn Lakos, author of \"Large Scale C++ Software Design.\", serves at Bloomberg LP in New York City as a senior architect and mentor for C++ Software Development world-wide. He is also an active voting member of the C++ Standards Committee, Library Working Group. Previously, Dr. Lakos directed the design and development of infrastructure libraries for proprietary analytic financial applications at Bear Stearns. For 12 years prior, Dr. Lakos developed large frameworks and advanced ICCAD applications at Mentor Graphics, for which he holds multiple software patents. His academic credentials include a Ph.D. in Computer Science ('97) and an Sc.D. in Electrical Engineering ('89) from Columbia University. Dr. Lakos received his undergraduate degrees from MIT in Mathematics ('82) and Computer Science ('81). His next book, entitled \"Large-Scale C++, Volume I: Process and Architecture\", is anticipated in 2014.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
