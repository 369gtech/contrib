recordingDate: 1590414111
description: "For modern applications, developers often need to connect disparate systems using HTTP APIs. This session shows you how building those solutions with Azure Logic Apps and Azure API Management puts you the developer at the center; create integration applications with the tools you want, and deploy those apps wherever you need them to run. We will share the latest innovations with these services, show real-world examples, and give you an early look at what is coming in the near future.\n\nMicrosoft Learn -- https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/?WT.mc_id=Build2020_presentation_additionalresources\nMicrosoft Docs -- https://docs.microsoft.com/?WT.mc_id=Build2020_presentation_additionalresources\nChannel 9 -- https://channel9.msdn.com/?WT.mc_id=Build2020_presentation_additionalresources\n\n\nRelated Sessions\nINT174B -- https://mybuild.microsoft.com/sessions/INT174B?wt.mc_id=yt_PLlrxD0HtieHhlbuh4wiUVHGeVw8vY4Rco\nINT174C -- https://mybuild.microsoft.com/sessions/INT174C?wt.mc_id=yt_PLlrxD0HtieHhlbuh4wiUVHGeVw8vY4Rco\nINT174A -- https://mybuild.microsoft.com/sessions/INT174A?wt.mc_id=yt_PLlrxD0HtieHhlbuh4wiUVHGeVw8vY4Rco"
