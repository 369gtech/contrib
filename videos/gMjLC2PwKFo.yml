description: "Modern authentication protocols such as SAML, OAuth and OpenID Connect. Claims, bearer tokens and JWT tokens are traversing various authentication flow paths in your environment today. In this session we will break down these authentication concepts and common flows for the non-identity admin. We will also discuss some common attacks and defenses the security team should be monitoring for and implementing in their environment.\n\nMany organization's applications are moving to modern authentication protocols such as SAML, OAuth and OpenID Connect. Claims, bearer tokens and JWT tokens are traversing various authentication flow paths in your environment today. Security teams need to be just as familiar with how these work, the risks and the benefits they provide, as they are with Kerberos tickets and NTLM hashes (please stop btw). In this session we will break down these authentication concepts and common flows for the non-identity admin. We will also discuss some common attacks and defenses the security team should be monitoring for and implementing in their environment."
