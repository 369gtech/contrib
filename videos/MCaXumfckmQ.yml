title: 'An Introduction to Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) with Cucumber for Java'
language: English
recordingDate: 1450128785
description: "This tutorial TUT1607 looks at what Cucumber is good for—and what it isn’t. It briefly covers what behavior-driven development (BDD) is and how Cucumber helps deliver on the promise of improved communication between the business and the development team. Then it dives into how Cucumber works, the specific details of the Java version (Cucumber-JVM), and what makes it different from other similar tools. Finally, it considers how Cucumber can fit into your test automation strategy and produce \"living documentation\" that is always up to date. You will come away with everything you need to know to be able to decide whether BDD (using Cucumber-JVM) is for you.\n\nSpeaker:\nSeb Rose, Developer & consultant, Claysnow\nConsultant, coach, designer, analyst and developer for over 30 years.
