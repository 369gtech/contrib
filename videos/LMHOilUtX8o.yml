recordingDate: 1384273988
description: "http://strataconf.com/strataeu2013/public/schedule/detail/32998\n\nJulie Steele is the Content Editor for Strata at O'Reilly Media. She is co-author of Beautiful Visualization and Designing Data Visualizations. She finds beauty in exploring complex systems, and thinks in metaphors. She is particularly drawn to the visual medium as a way to understand and transmit information.\nhttp://strataconf.com/strataeu2013/public/schedule/detail/32998\nJulie holds a Master's degree in Political Science (International Relations) from Rutgers University in Newark. She lives in New York City, where she cooks, reads, designs, and practices yoga. You can find her blogging occasionally for O'Reilly Radar, or on Twitter.\n\nData science may seem like a revolutionary new field, but it is merely the latest incarnation of a tradition as old as we are: storytelling. And because it is part of such an inherently human practice, it is most valuable when it takes humanity into account. This talk explores how to use data and the techniques associated with data to build things that matter, by looking back to look forward."
