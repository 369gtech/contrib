Kubernetes allows you to easily rollout new code and quickly revert to safe, stable releases when issues are identified. But often the damage done in the short period between deploy and rollback is significant.\n\nIn this session, we’ll show you how to limit the effect of unforeseen issues using canary deploys with Istio. We’ll also cover ways to better monitor your applications in Kubernetes to help you spot potential problems before they affect your entire customer base.\n\nJason Yee \nFrom Datadog\nJason is a technical evangelist at Datadog, where he works to inspire developers and ops engineers with the power of metrics and monitoring. Previously, he was the community manager for DevOps & Performance at O’Reilly Media and a software engineer at MongoDB. He’s currently exploring the world while living as a nomad and would love to hear about the part of the world that you call home."
