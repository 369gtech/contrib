title: 'DEF CON 26 WIRELESS VILLAGE  - recompiler - Attacking Gotenna Networks'
language: English
recordingDate: 1542156569
description: 'Talk will focus on privacy (or lack thereof) of gotenna networks. We will cover traditional attacks which have only been available to state sponsored prior to popularization and wide availability of software defined radios. We will cover signal analysis, triangulation, protocol analysis, deanonimization, cryptanalysis, spoofing and selective jamming. Since the gotenna ecosystem also includes an app we will cover the vulnerabilities in the underlying crypto libraries, weak token generation, broken API segregation as well as other vulnerabilities. You too can learn how to analyze, snoop on and exploit RF networks like a pro with a hackrf, laptop and some elbow grease, sweat and sleep deprivation.'
