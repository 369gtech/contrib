title: 'Compile Time Type vs Runtime Type'
recordingDate: 1375537190
description: 'During compile time, the compiler makes a static analysis (fancy word for compile-time analysis) of a variable''s declared type. At runtime, an actual instance is created and assigned to the variable (hence, runtime). See the difference in this video.'
