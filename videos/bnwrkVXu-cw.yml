description: "Speaker: Kir Shatrov, Production Engineer, Shopify\n\nAt Shopify, we run a massive ChatOps deployment that ties out Internal tools together. Weâ€™re developing a platform for the useful scripts written by developers around the company to be discoverable. The platform makes it simple for any employee to automate workflow by writing a script. I will talk about the history of ChatOps and its culture at Shopify, about the reasons behind creating our own chat framework, building the DSL and grammar rules parser, scaling ChatOps and providing the better chat experience than other frameworks have.\n\nSpeaker's Bio\nKir Shatrov is a Production Engineer at Shopify, a current maintainer of Capistrano and a Rails contributor. He coaches RailsGirls and hosts the RubyNoName Podcast.\n\nEvent Page: http://www.reddotrubyconf.com\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/ONqG/"
