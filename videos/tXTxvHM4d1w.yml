description: "The Agile Manifesto says “Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.” That’s nice but..how do we actually do that ? What’s the difference between continuous deployment and continuous integration ? What does that mean for the business ? How will this change the way we work and write code ? Build an environment which allows us to continuously deliver software in an automated fashion can be very hard, especially in a large fast growing company. In this session we will explore practices, techniques and tools we can use to set up a development process which enables automated deployment.\n\nAbout the topic: Passionate hands on software architect with over 15 years of experience.I am a strong advocate of distributed systems, ReST, event driven architecture, messaging, automation testing and continuous delivery with an obsession for clean codeMy main areas of expertise are C#, .NET, OO, TDD, BDD, ATDD, DDD, CQRS, Agile Engineering Practices.
