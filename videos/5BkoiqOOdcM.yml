title: 'Gradle approaching 4.0 (Rene Groeschke, Principal Engineer at Gradle Inc)'
recordingDate: 1504535580
description: 'Gradle is approaching version 4.0 very soon. In this talk we’ll discuss the most exciting features, that build authors and developers can expect from the popular build tool since the last major release. We will explore how composite builds allow you to combine builds that are developed independently, how Gradle builds java projects faster than ever leveraging compile avoidance and a distributed cache and we’ll look into crafting build scripts with Kotlin with all the convenience you are acustomed from your IDE. The talk will be finished up with an outlook of what the Gradle team is working on next and what you can expect beyond Gradle 4.0.'
