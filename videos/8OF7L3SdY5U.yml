title: 'Fast reliable Swift builds with Buck Robbert van Ginkel'
language: English
recordingDate: 1510141206
description: "Uber's mobile team is using Buck, a high performance build tool, to facilitate fast and reliable builds for iOS. In the months after the team switched to Buck, we adopted Swift to support the rewrite of our rider application.\n\nThe Buck build tool did not have swift support, so Uber is contributing this back to the open source project. This talk will show how buck's declarative builds and distributed caching can help you scale your mobile builds, and specifically focus on how Apple's Swift language and its compilation model fit into buck.\n\n Robbert van Ginkel\nI'm an engineer on Uber's mobile developer productivity team in Amsterdam. I work on build systems and infrastructure to empower teams of mobile engineers to focus on a product rather than the development process."
