title: 'Surviving as a professional software developer'
recordingDate: 1431331064
description: 'During the last year’s JEEConf Yakov Fain made a presentation on how to become a professional software developer. This presentation is a sequel. Yakov will present his no-BS point of view on how enterprise IT shops live and operate. He’ll talk about communication skills, bad attitude, the team work, those stupid and useless IT managers, and how the life is unfair if young prodigies have to debug old and poorly-written code. This is not a technical presentation.'
