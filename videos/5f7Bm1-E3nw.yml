description: "Enhancing the Routing Tier in CF: Istio and Envoy for Ingress Routing - Aaron Hurley, Pivotal\n\nIstio and Envoy are booming in the Open Source community. With heavy investments from industry-leading companies such as Google, IBM, and Lyft, these tools are developing at a rapid pace and continue to receive increased attention. The Cloud Foundry Routing team has been exploring how these technologies can contribute to the Cloud Foundry routing tier. With Istio and Envoy comes a lengthy list of features and enabling these in CF would provide a major benefit to all. We will provide our findings of how Istio and Envoy are able to contribute to Cloud Foundryâ€™s ingress routing capabilities and what the future might hold. \n\nAbout Aaron Hurley\nAaron has been with Pivotal for 3 years and is currently serving as the anchor for the Cloud Foundry Routing team. Previously, he had stints on the MySQL, BOSH CPI, and BOSH teams within CF."
