description: "TestCon Vilnius 2016. Software Testing & QA Conference. \nOctober 21, 2016 | www.testcon.lt\n\nIn order to reach the test flow the four mental capabilities can be influenced by four mental tools or abilities: Goal setting, visualization, self-talk and stress control. In this presentation Ard used session based testing to show how to apply these mental tools. For example: “What are the kinds of goals you can set during a test session? Is “find 100 bugs” a good goal or is it better to set yourself a goal which is under full control and achievable in the test session.”"
