recordingDate: 1629403150
description: 'Ever wonder how clouds, landscapes or flow fields are generated for video games and special effects? The answer is noise! Noise appears to be a simple tool but, it has so many applications. I''ve used it to generate one-of-a-kind profile images. A confetti greeting card. Animated blobs. Ghost planets. And even drawings of flow fields. This talk takes a deep dive into the world of generative art with JavaScript! I''ll show you how to use noise to create organic-looking effects and all kinds of wild imagery right in your browser.'
