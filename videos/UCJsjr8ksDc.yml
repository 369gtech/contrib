description: "RubyConf 2019 - Fixing Performance & Memory problems by Frederick Cheung\n\nPerformance problems got you down? Do memory leaks strike fear in your heart?\n\r\n\nIn this session I'll share two real world stories of how you can solve performance problems and plug memory leaks. You'll learn how to use tools such as ruby-prof and stackprof, interpret their output and gain extra insight into how your code is performing.\r\n\n\r\n\nWhen dealing with memory leaks, the biggest challenge can be finding them. You'll learn how to use rbtrace and ObjectSpace to identify what objects are being leaked and by which code, so that you can approach leaks with confidence.\n\n#confreaks #rubyconf2019"
