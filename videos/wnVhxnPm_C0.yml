description: "Наша группа в ФБ: https://www.facebook.com/dotnetfest/\nНаш сайт: www.dotnetfest.com\n\nДоклад на конференции .NET Fest 2017 в Киеве.\nIf you ask now Microsoft the “Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything” they will answer Azure not 42. Yet for the IoT (and IIoT) space is pretty much the right answer. \nThis presentation will try to give you the “Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything”, if you are in the IoT field. You will see at work, understand what they do and how to use it to maximum effect the Azure cloud part of a IoT solution. Now you will be puzzled when you hear terms like stream analytics, IoT Hub, gateway, Time Series Insights and so on."
