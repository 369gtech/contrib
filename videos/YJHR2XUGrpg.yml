description: 'Without the right tools the engagement can be over before it begins, as upfront resistance can prevent you from entering with your tools. Billy Boatright demonstrates and discusses how to use social engineering tactics to get in without any difficulty. While most think outside of the box, Billy shows us how to think inside the box and embrace your own handicaps to arm yourself with advanced tactics and unfair advantages. Billy shows us how handicaps and familiar objects can be used to covertly carry your toolbox into an engagement, increasing your success. Rather than dealing with a perceived disadvantage, use it to exploit the world around you.'
