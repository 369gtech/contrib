description: "(Recorded at Jfokus 2016. http://www.jfokus.com)\n\nGit From the Bits Up\n\nSo you've gotten a handle on Git and know how to use it for everyday development tasks like committing code and pushing and pulling changes with the rest of the team. But do you really know how it works under the covers? In this brief demonstration, we'll commit a file to a brand new repository without ever touching the git add or git commit commands, and in the process learn some critical Git internals that every power user should know. We'll also take a look at some advanced history and undo commands like reflog and reset, and how to rewrite past mistakes with interactive rebase. Come for 45 minutes of advanced Git fun!\n\nTim Berglund, DataStax\n\nTim is a teacher, author, and technology leader with DataStax, where he serves as the Director of Training.
