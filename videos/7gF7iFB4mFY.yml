description: "In this talk Lennart will show how to implement a toy EDSL (Embedded Domain Specific Language) in Haskell.\n\nFirst, we will look at how to get a typed DSL embedded in Haskell.\n\nThen, we will consider executing such a language using an interpreter.\n\nFinally, we will use the LLVM bindings to generate some efficient code for the toy EDSL. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiked the song? It's \"Tank\" by Seatbelts"
