description: "Writing purely functional applications is hard. There are a lot of parts of the puzzle like typelevel/cats, typelevel/cats-effect, category theory, etc; But, unfortunately, there is no defined complete approach to do that.\nIn this talk, Yaroslav puts it all together and provides a set of rules for writing such kind of applications. Firstly, we are going to abstract over a container, and define code capabilities using typeclasses from cats and cats-effect. Then, he shows some practical problems we can easily solve using given approach. Currently, this approach is being adopted and used more commonly."
