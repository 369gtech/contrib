description: "As is often the case with software development, we try to plan ahead yet we frequently fail. Here at JFrog, when we envisioned Bintray as a high-loaded distribution service, we planned for scale. And yet, when it hit us, we still had to adopt.\n\nIn this session you will time travel through two years of agile architecture – we’ll explore and share with you what components we took, what decisions we made, what stayed, what changed, and why. Through our successes, failures, and corrections we can share our lessons learnt to benefit you on current and future endeavors.\n\nYoav is the CTO and co-founder of JFrog, the Universal Artifact Repository & Distribution Platform.\n\nYoav laid the foundation to JFrog’s first product in 2006 when he founded Artifactory as an open source project. In 2008 he co-founded JFrog to change the way people are managing, distributing and updating software artifacts.\n\nPrior to creating JFrog, Yoav was an architect and consultant in the field of CI management and distributed applications. Yoav is also a JavaOne Rock Star speaker.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
