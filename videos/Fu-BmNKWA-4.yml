description: "AskTHAT Live with Steven Hicks - Fear, Rejection and Public Speaking\n\nSteven Hicks is a web development generalist with nearly 20 years experience. He believes in clean, readable, and maintainable code. Steve likes to use the right tool for the job, especially if the right tool is JavaScript. He strongly believes that if you ain't falling, you ain't learning. \n\nSteve embraces continuous improvement and believes that a developer's job is to solve problems, not just write code. He is a speaker, a teacher, a learner, and a teammate.\n\nWhen he isn't talking to the duck or crushing 1s and 0s, you can find Steve outside. He's probably camping with his family, at a triathlon, on his mountain bike, or in a climbing gym. \n\nLinks:\n* https://stevenhicks.me\n* Twitter: https://twitter.com/pepopowitz"
