description: "Karen Sandler\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/125/\n\nAs we increasingly live in a world where our devices are interconnected, the line becomes blurrier between strictly private information and information that is shared. From medical devices to in home security systems to oral medication with sensors embedded, our most personal data is often being broadcast by default, sometimes without appropriate security measures and without an off switch. Because of this, it is essential that any device that interacts with personal information have the option of having connectivity disabled. This talk will explore the current state of personal devices and the steps we need to take to make sure we all have the right not to broadcast our most personal information when we need most to protect it.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
