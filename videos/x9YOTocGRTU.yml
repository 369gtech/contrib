description: "From React to Jetpack Compose\nStephen White, Callista EnterpriseStephen White\n\nAbstract React has paved the way for a new way of creating user interfaces. Previously, it was common to imperatively create and manage the state of various GUI components, which lead to issues with complex code and painful synchronisation problems between the model and user interface.\n\nReact instead describes the user interface and the connection to the data model in a declarative way. This means that no matter how or in what order the data in the model changes, you can be sure that the user interface always displays the correct data.\n\nNow the concepts from React have moved on to frameworks for native development on both iOS and Android. In this lecture, we review how the React-inspired Android framework Jetpack Compose works and what benefits it provides. We show practical examples of implementation in Kotlin and shed light on how the step from React to native development has now been significantly reduced.\n\nRecorded Tuesday 16 March 2021 kl. 12:00"
