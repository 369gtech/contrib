title: 'GeeCON Prague 2018: Martin Osovský - Beyond thermostats: Distributed Applications living on the Edge'
recordingDate: 1541257469
description: 'The next stage in Cloud Computing is the Edge Computing concept, where applications and services are moving from the cloud to run locally, in managed environments, close to the end users, eliminating latency and availability issues. Microsoft and Amazon are investing heavily into their Edge computing platforms: Azure IoT Edge and Amazon Greengrass. Even though this may look like a high-overhead toolkit for expensive thermostats, it is much more. Y Soft has been delivering hybrid systems since 2008 and we are now embracing IoT Edge as additional platform to build and deliver our applications on. IoT Edge has its advantages and disadvantages, but it has its place in the world and for embracing it may have huge positive impact on availability of applications. How this is done for complex systems and what is our experience with it will be part of the talk.'
