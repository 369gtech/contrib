description: "A Google TechTalk, 2019/10/10, presented by Beka Westberg.\nABSTRACT: Blockly now supports fully custom fields! Fields are renderable components on a block that are usually editable by a user. The new APIs make creating custom fields easy and bring consistency to their input validation. Follow along with Beka as she shows off examples for creating custom fields and validators, from turtle pickers to mini block backpacks. Slides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_dpbjIU8o7Pj1zZw2GT119XneYJk6aZREreyo5TZAG8/edit?usp=sharing\n\nMore about the Summit: https://sites.google.com/corp/view/blockly-user-summit-2019/agenda\n\nAbout the speaker: Beka is an active contributor to the Blockly core, working on everything from trashcan UI to the connection database.  Most recently she helped refactor the custom fields API and is also the primary author of Blockly's field documentation (https://developers.google.com/blockly/guides/create-custom-blocks/fields/overview).\n\nWhen not programming Beka spends time reading, hiking, and enjoying her pet snail, Stapledon."
