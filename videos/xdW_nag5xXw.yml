description: "by Pietro Abate\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/H.1302/tezos.webm\n\n\nGovernance is a big topic in the blockchain world. Deciding on the evolution of the protocol,\neven changing a constant can fracture the community. Hard forks are not uncommon with often\nnegative consequences. Tezos, an emerging blockchain, has been designed from the ground up\nwith the idea of on-chain Governance, where changes are decided by the community on the Tezos\nblockchain using an open and democratic process. In particular in the context of FOSDEM, this talk will focus on the benefits that this type\nof governance can offer to the developer community in terms of visibility, rewards and potential\nfor open collaboration. \n\nI'll provide background on the topic, an overview of Tezos and its current protocol in relation\nto voting and governance, and close the talk with a few ideas about the future. \n\nRoom: H.1302 (Depage)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 10:50:00+01"
