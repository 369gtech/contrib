description: "SRE and Presidential Campaigns\n\nNat Welch, Hillary for America\n\nHillary for America was the organization created for Hillary Clintonâ€™s 2016 presidential campaign. By election day, the campaign employed 82 software developers. A team of four SREs and two Security Engineers helped protect and scale close to a hundred backend services against a constant stream of DDoS, looming deadlines and constantly shifting priorities. \n\nThis team helped build an environment to promote building new projects in a week for immovable deadlines, raising billions of dollars from donors, and withstand spiky and semi-unpredictable traffic. We will walk through how they did this, the unusual schedule of a presidential campaign and how that affects a growing tech team.\n\nView the full SREcon17 Americas Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon17americas/program"
