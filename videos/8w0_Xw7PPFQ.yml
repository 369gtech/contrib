title: 'Jake Verbaten: NPM-style Frontend [JSConf2014]'
recordingDate: 1405344980
description: "This talk is about a modular frontend which is an approach not common to most frontend developers. No jQuery, no frameworks. Instead many small, simple abstractions are used, published to npm and bundled with browserify.\n\nThe NPM-style frontend prefers modularity and simple abstractions that do one thing well. This talk includes:\n\n    * Various approaches to creating standalone \"components\" or \"widgets\" that are published to npm, including styles & templates.\n    * How to compose various modules together to build your own \"framework\" with your own trade offs.\n    * How to compose an application from smaller applications\n    * Build small UI components with thin interfaces that you glue together in your application.\n\nYour entry point is small, containing the minimal glue code and each UI component addresses its own concerns."
