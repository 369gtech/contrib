title: 'SREcon20 Americas - Weeks of Debugging Can Save You Hours of TLA+'

description: "Weeks of Debugging Can Save You Hours of TLA+\n\nMarkus A. Kuppe, Microsoft\n\nTLA+ is a language for the specification and verification of discrete systems, including concurrent and distributed algorithms. The behavior of systems is described in the form of state machines, written in a language based on mathematical set theory and temporal logic. The same language also serves to express safety and liveness properties. TLA+ is supported by tools for computer-assisted verification, including model checkers for verifying finite instances and an interactive proof system. In summary, TLA+ is a design tool to build reliable systems that don't need patching at 3 am on weekends.\n\nIn this talk, we will take the hands-on approach and study the powers of TLA+ by collectively solving a subtle concurrency issue that (as we will pretend) has brought our system down even though the system was heavily tested.\n\nView the full SREcon20 Americas program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon20americas/program"
