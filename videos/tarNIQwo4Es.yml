description: "Phishing seems easy enough, but getting successful results can be difficult. In this talk we'll walk through practical tips for getting better responses. We'll talk about target selection, ruse development, technology deployment, and suggestions for working with clients to maximize the value of the assessment.\n\nAbout Nathan Sweaney: Nathan works for Secure Ideas testing pens and consulting clients. He's been in the infosec industry for a decade or so working with a wide range of clients and technologies. He's regularly told that he takes all of the fun out of things and is eager to argue about politics and religion. Hailing from the great state of Oklahoma, he hopes you'll all keep flying over it & leave us alone. Twitter: @sweaney"
