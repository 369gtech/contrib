description: "Perl 5 has been described in many ways; a Shinto Shrine, executable line noise, a Swiss Army Chainsaw, the Duct Tape of the Internet, etc. But I think Perl 5 is more like a old pop star, always reinventing itself to stay relevant, never truly leaving our consciousness, always just a melody away.\n\nOver the past several years I have been (slowly) working on a design for a new object system that would be suitable for inclusion in the Perl 5 core. This year I began releasing the various components to CPAN and in this talk we will discuss them and my dreams for the next incarnation of Perl 5.\n\n\nStevan Little is a programming language enthusiast and while he loves all languages, Perl has found a special place in his heart. Stevan is a CPAN contributor and was the original author of the Moose module. His current focus is on improving the Object Oriented features in the core of Perl."
