description: "About the talk:\nMy unofficial job title is Accessibility Hobo because really that’s what I am. I do accessibility and I’m homeless in the sense that I join teams, projects and companies helping with accessibility whether it be UX, design, development, testing, strategy or maintenance.\n\nA constant question on my travels from every individual, team, or company that I work with is «How the heck do we do this?» .\n\nTeams generally know what to do: follow the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 which cover colour contrast, text alternatives, keyboard accessibility, structure etc, etc, etc… In fact, so much «etc» it becomes a little overwhelming to know where to start or how to integrate accessibility into process. So, where do we start?\n\nMeet another hobo… Button. A simple element used in complex ways, requiring cross team collaboration to get right.\n\nIn this talk I will look at the button’s journey as it goes through the design and development process set against the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines and the Inclusive Design Principles. We’ll follow the button’s journey to make it accessible and usable across a variety of contexts surfacing along the way how teams can collaborate and integrate accessibility into process.\n\nAbout the speaker:\nHenny Swan – Director Of User Experience at The Paciello Group. Previously Senior Accessibility Specialist at BBC and Web Evangelist at Opera.\n\nAbout the conference:\nDesign conference that’s not about buzzwords, but collaboration between designers. Our 5th User Experience design conference on March 2020 was themed around how UX, UI, content and graphic designers can work together better. \n\nWe've had insightful talks on day 1 and hands-on workshops on day 2 by speakers with experience working in Transport for London, OpenTable, The Paciello Group, Nike, Government Digital Service, Airbnb, Shopify, InVision, DuckDuckGo and others. From A/B Testing and Content Design to Design Language Systems and Ethical design.\n \nThe event was organised by The School of UX and kindly supported by SumUp and Sketch.
