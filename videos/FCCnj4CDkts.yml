description: "As an industry, our capability for delivering software increased\nsignificantly over the last ten years. We now have much better\nprocesses, tools and techniques, and we can produce a lot more\nsoftware significantly easier and faster. But companies rarely get the\nbenefits from this new capability, because the ecosystem around\nsoftware teams hasn't improved at the same speed. This talk will focus\non how to unlock all that potential, and turn the fact that your teams\ncan deliver frequently into an engine that will help you outrun your\ncompetition. This is a talk for tech and business people."
