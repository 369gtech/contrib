Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nContour is an open source Kubernetes ingress controller providing the control plane for the Envoy edge and service proxy.â€‹ Contour supports dynamic configuration updates and multi-team ingress delegation out of the box while maintaining a lightweight profile.\n\nUsing Contour you can quickly deploy cloud-native applications, update Envoy configurations on the fly, and safely delegate ingress configuration to protect service access on multi-team Kubernetes clusters.\n\nIn this webinar, Steve Sloka, Sr. Member of Technical Staff at VMware, will share how to use Contour and Envoy efficiently in your Kubernetes clusters."
