title: 'Nathan Marz -- The Epistemology of Software Engineering'
recordingDate: 1394122006
description: "Bio:\n\nNathan Marz is currently working on a new startup. Previously, he was the lead engineer at BackType before being acquired by Twitter in 2011. At Twitter, he started the streaming compute team which provides and develops shared infrastructure to support many critical realtime applications throughout the company.\n\nNathan is the creator of many open source projects which are relied upon by over 50 companies around the world, including Cascalog and Storm. Nathan is also working on a book for Manning Publications entitled \"Big Data: principles and best practices of scalable realtime data systems\" due out for publication later this year.\n\nNathan's blog: http://nathanmarz.com/.\n\n\n\nPresentation:\nThe Epistemology of Software Engineering\nLanguage: EN\n\nHow do you know your software is correct? When you dig deep into that question, it turns out there's no easy answer. There may be no answer whatsoever.\n\nThis question parallels one of the most fundamental questions in philosophy: \"How do I know a proposition is true?\" This question is so difficult that there's an entire field of philosophy dedicated to it, epistemology. The various schools of thought in epistemology are eerily similar to the various techniques used by software engineers to determine software correctness.\n\nTake a whirlwhind tour through the epistemology of software engineering and see how philosophers like Descartes, Hume, and Locke can teach us to write better code. See how schools of thought like foundationalism, skepticism, and empiricism relate to software development. And finally, you'll see why Aristotle would have been a terrible programmer."
