title: 'Social networks and trust : NetTrust'
recordingDate: 1204369223
description: "Google Tech Talks\nFebruary, 28 2008\n\nABSTRACT\n\nNetTrust is a system that embeds social context in browsing by combining individual histories, social networks, and explicit ratings. NetTrust combines an implicit and explicit means of data collection. This trust based system uses shared browsing histories from a user's self-selected social networks to create both explicit and implicit data collection. NetTrust targets the human element of trust. It projects how a social network can signal meaningful trust information that can make an educative browsing experience. NetTrust allows an individual to select their own trusted sources of information and rate particular sites as trustworthy (or not). NetTrust allows an individual to select their own trusted authoritative sources of information from a market of ratings agencies and combine these ratings with the reputation information from their individual social network. This paper will present the Net Trust system; the dorm-based homophily tests with implications and the undergraduate-focused user testing.\n\n\nSpeaker: Professor L. Jean Camp\nProfessor L.
