recordingDate: 1539019384
description: "Blockchain. Is there likely to be a bigger buzzword over the next few years? As more and more cryptocurrencies make their debuts, the underlying technology is starting to mature and businesses from a wide range of industries are starting to take note.\n\nThis talk will explore some of the key concepts from a JavaScript point of view. We'll start by putting together a simple blockchain, progress to adding peer-to-peer networking to allow the nodes in our network to communicate, proof of work so that those nodes can trust the data they receive, and finally a transaction system to put that blockchain to use.\n\nYou'll go away with a solid understanding of core blockchain and cryptocurrency concepts that should give you a great head start as we head into a landscape increasingly dominated by such technologies.\n\nDevConf 2018 (http://devconf.pl)\n26-28 September 2018"
