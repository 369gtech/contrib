title: 'Unravel your REPL - Paulus Esterhazy'
language: English
recordingDate: 1502815559
description: 'Unravel is a new REPL client focused on human interaction. Instead of relying on nREPL, it communicates using unrepl, a simple protocol based on streams of EDN values. In this presentation, I show how unravel takes advantage of unrepl to create a rich terminal UI; how features like live documentation, auto-completion and an interactive data explorer are implemented; and finally how unravel and unrepl could help improve the overall state of Clojure tooling.'
