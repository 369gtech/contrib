description: 'We are in the middle of paradigm shift from services to distributed execution blocks. In this talk, we will see how scaling HTTP based micro-services is hard, and how cooperative RPC functions can facilitate our lives. Designing and deployment are going to be the main focus, with a final focus on how to operate such an architecture at scale. When software and hardware can scale performances at unimaginable boundaries, people and operations are forced to follow and that’s where most of the time all of these becomes complex and unmaintainable…but we have a solution for that.'
