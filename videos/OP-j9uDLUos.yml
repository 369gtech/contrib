title: 'Codemotion Milan 2019 I The Life of a Packet Through Istio'
language: English
recordingDate: 1573915926
description: "Istio is a service mesh for Kubernetes that offers advanced networking features. It provides intelligent routing, resiliency, and security features, so that service authors don't have to keep re-implementing them. Istio is rapidly taking off and there are great introductory talks everywhere. However in this session, we will explore precisely how it does what it does, following one brave little packet in from the internet and back out again. This will give a great insight into Istio's full power, and its fascinating architecture. \n\n\nAbout: \nMatt Turner, CTO, Native Wave\n\nMatt is CTO at Native Wave, a consultancy that designs, builds, and manages cloud-native platforms using the best open source software. Native Wave works with the whole business to re-architect and refactor applications to get the most from modern cloud technologies. Matt has been doing Dev, sometimes with added Ops, for over a decade. His idea of \"full-stack\" is Linux, Kubernetes, and now Istio too. He's given many talks and workshops on Kubernetes and Istio, and is co-organiser of the Istio London meetup. He tweets @mt165 and blogs at https://mt165.co.uk"
