title: 'Discoverability and Composability: Writing an ECS for Fun and Profit - José Joaquín Atria'
language: English
recordingDate: 1623175050
description: "ECS is the architectural pattern that took game development by storm, but it still sees little use in other areas. How does it work? How can I use it? And why should I? In this talk, I'll try to answer these questions and dissect one simple but effective implementation that is ready to use.\n\nThe first time I attempted to write and use an ECS, I read the same articles and blog posts that everyone does and completely missed the point. A year or so later, while giving this a fresh go, I figured out the part that was missing, and ended up writing an entity registry that is simple and fast (enough), and learning a ton about data structures and algorithms in the process.\n\nJoin me in this talk as I show what I tried first, why it was entirely the wrong thing to do, and why this current attempt is different. In the process, we'll learn about sparse sets, data locality, and I'll demonstrate some libraries you can use right now."
