language: English
recordingDate: 1602711280
description: 'In this session, we talked about how Oracle stores datetime values in table columns. We looked at the internal storage format of DATE, TIMESTAMP, TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE, and TIMESTAMP WITH LOCAL TIME ZONE values. We discussed what time zone regions are and why we may need to update stored datetime values, if a new time zone file version is installed. In the next month, we will continue with description of the time zone file upgrade process.'
