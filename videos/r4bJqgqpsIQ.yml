description: "Our software needs to become reactive, this realization is widely understood: we need to consider responsiveness, maintainability, elasticity and scalability from the outset. Not all systems need to implement all these to the same degree, specific project requirements will determine where effort is most wisely spent, but in the vast majority of cases the need to go reactive will demand that we design our applications differently.\n\nIn this presentation we explore several architecture elements that are commonly found in reactive systems (like the circuit breaker, various replication techniques, or flow control protocols). These patterns are language agnostic and also independent of the abundant choice of reactive programming frameworks and libraries, they are well-specified starting points for exploring the design space of a concrete problem: thinking is strictly required!\n\nTarget audience\n\nProgrammers, architects, CIO/CTOs and everyone with a desire to challenge the status quo and expand their horizons on how to tackle the current and future challenges in the computing industry.\n\nAbout Roland\n\nRoland Kuhn is leading the Akka project at Typesafe, a co-author of the Reactive Manifesto and the book Reactive Design Patterns, co-teaching the Coursera course “Principles of Reactive Programming” and a passionate open-source hakker. He also holds a PhD in particle physics and has worked in the space industry for several years. See also rolandkuhn.com."
