description: "Failure is Not an Option! SRE Lessons 50 Years after the Apollo 13 Flight to the Moon\n\nRobert Barron, IBM\n\n2020 marked the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 13 mission - what was supposed to be a \"\"routine\"\" third landing on the Moon turned into a dramatic odyssey as an explosion nearly destroyed the spacecraft when it was on the way to the Moon.\n\nIt was the incredible efforts of the astronauts in space and the engineers on the ground that ensured the safe return of the astronauts.\n\nWhat were these efforts? While the terms \"\"Site Reliability Engineering\"\", \"\"Observability\"\", \"\"Chaos Engineering\"\", and others did not exist in 1970, NASA's training and preparation of the astronauts and engineers cover many of the principles and practices of modern Site Reliability Engineering.\n\nHow did NASA prepare for the mission? How did they work to solve the problems which occurred during the missions? And how did they learn and improve their systems for future missions.\n\nFind out by attending this session.\n\nView the full SREcon20 Americas program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon20americas/program"
