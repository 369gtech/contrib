description: "Recorded at SpringOne Platform 2016.\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/high-performance-microservices-with-ratpack-and-spring-boot-64889596\n\nRatpack and Spring Boot are a match made in microservice heaven. Each brings its respective strengths to the task of building a compelling service for the cloud. Spring Boot's incorporation of the Spring and Spring Cloud ecosystems make it an excellent choice for building service components; Ratpack's nature as a reactive web framework and its emphasis on performance and efficiency make it a premiere choice for a durable web tier. When the two frameworks join forces, developers become unstoppable. This talk will showcase Ratpack and Spring Boot's complementary integrations, and demonstrate, through live coding, building a high performance microservice."
