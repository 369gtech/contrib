Partisan reduces message latency through a combination of three predominately automatic optimizations: parallelism, named channels and affinitized scheduling. Partisan also assists the developer in deployment of their distributed applications by providing orchestration through Kubernetes, Mesos or Docker. Finally, Christopher presents preliminary work on improving the resiliency of your distributed applications through Partisan's new fault-injection framework.\n\nRead the full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/christopher-meiklejohn/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - CHRISTOPHER MEIKLEJOHN\nCarnegie Mellon University Ph.D student\n\nChristopher lives for distributed programming. \n\nMore on Christopher Meiklejohn: https://codesync.global/speaker/christopher-meiklejohn/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM SF 19\nCode BEAM SF is powered by Code Sync.
