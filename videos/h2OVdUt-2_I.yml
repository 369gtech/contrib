description: 'The topic of Initial Coin Offerings seems rather simple on a high level. A company can issue a token through a smart contract to fund its projectâ€™s development. However, issues have arisen over time with simpler protocols of the first ICOs: some undesirable economic properties made token sales either unpredictable or inaccessible for investors, which in turn also lead to congestions of underlying P2P networks due to increased demand. The increase of severity of these issues over time has sparked additional research and development of more sophisticated ICO protocols.'
