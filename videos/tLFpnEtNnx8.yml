description: "Talk recording from AmsterdamJS March 2018 Meetup https://www.meetup.com/AmsterdamJS/events/248340587/\n\nDuring this talk, you'll learn how to leverage your web development skills to create beautiful and performant native mobile apps. With NativeScript, you can either use vanilla JavaScript, TypeScript, Vue or Angular to create both iOS and Android apps with a single codebase. The Vue and Angular flavours even allow sharing code with a web version of your app!\nWhenever the built-in cross-platform modules don't provide a certain feature, you can extend NativeScript's capabilities by adding third party (or your own) plugins. Allow me to show you a few cool plugins the community has built.\n\nAbout Eddy\nEddy is a full-stack developer with approximately 40 years of JavaScript experience. He maintains many free open source packages, most of which are plugins for Apache Cordova and NativeScript."
