language: English
recordingDate: 1419964306
description: "I will be talking about the \"No talk all action\" approach we take at RedMart for feature development. You’ll learn how we supercharge development and get code in production fast with an opinionated and automated development workflow. Hint: It’s a cocktail of Git, JS (of course), Chef, Devops & killing pointless meetings.\n\nRitesh is an Engineer working on the next generation Ecommerce platform at RedMart, currently working on the frontend and continuous delivery. Apart from coding in JavaScript & Ruby, he loves extracting a perfect espresso & scoring goals while wearing the Juventus jersey!\n\nJSConf.Asia is the JavaScript, web and mobile developer conference for Asia. Amara Sanctuary, Singapore - 20 + 21 November 2014.\n\nSource: http://2014.jsconf.asia/#speakers\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/riteshangural/lightning-branches-at-redmart-js-conf-asia-2014-talk\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
