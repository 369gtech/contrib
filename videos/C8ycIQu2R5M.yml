title: 'ElixirConf 2021 - Jeffrey Matthias - Writing Maintainable Test Factories'
language: English
recordingDate: 1635129208
description: "The talk will start by discussing the advantages of using factories to speed up writing your tests. It will then discuss the reasonable criticism leveled at factories by Sasa Juric. This will help us highlight our goal: a solution that is maintainable (in response to Juric) while still providing the benefits of the factory pattern.\n\nThe talk will both cover ExMachina, the most common factory library, as well as teach folks how to write their own factory from scratch. After that, it will cover the patterns that need to be put in place to keep them useful and maintainable.\n\nThe talk will wrap up by covering how to start rescuing an overwhelming factory, moving to maintainable patterns.\n\nWalking out of this talk, people should be able to immediately be able to improve their test suites and therefore increase their happiness as developers."
