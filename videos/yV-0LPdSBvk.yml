description: "eirinix - Writing Extensions for Eirini - Vlad Iovanov & Ettore Di Giacinto, SUSE \n\nBy now you’ve already heard about Eirini. An awesome project that allows the deployment and management of applications on Kubernetes using the Cloud Foundry Platform.  We want to talk about “eirinix” - a framework that allows you to extend Eirini, built from the Quarks codebase, which leverages Kubernetes Mutating Webhooks.  With the flexibility of Kubernetes and Eirini’s architecture, we can now build features around Eirini, like Persi support, access to the application via SSH, ASGs via Network Policies and more.  In this talk, we’ll explain how this can be done, and how everyone can start contributing to a rich ecosystem of extensions that will improve Eirini and the developer experience of Cloud Foundry. \n\nFor more info: https://www.cloudfoundry.org/"
