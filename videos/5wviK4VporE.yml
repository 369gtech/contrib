description: "Vladimir Janjic -  Lapedo: A Hybrid Skeletal Framework for Programming Heterogeneous Multicores in Erlang\n\n\nVladimir Janjic is a post-doc at the University of St Andrews, where he is working on the various topics related to parallelism, including scheduling and load balancing, parallel patterns and mapping parallelism to heterogeneous hardware.\n\nLapedo: A Hybrid Skeletal Framework for Programming Heterogeneous Multicores in Erlang\n\nWe present the LAPEDO framework for programming heterogeneous multicore systems (comprising a mixture of processor types) in Erlang. Our framework combines our Skel library of parallel skeletons for Erlang, a new set of hybrid skeletons and novel refactorings for introducing parallelism, combined with the existing Wrangler refactoring tool and a new tool for managing CPU-GPU interactions. We demonstrate the use of our framework on realistic use cases, showing that we are able to quickly and easily significant and scalable speedups over the original sequential Erlang program."
