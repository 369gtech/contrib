title: 'Developing Reactive applications with Reactive Streams and Java 8 by Brian Clozel, Sébastien Deleuze'
language: English
recordingDate: 1478594610
description: "Sébastien and Brian promise one thing here: you'll leave that room with a good sense of what's reactive programming, where the Reactor project fits into the ecosystem, and how to use a reactive API in concrete, real-world use cases (web application calling external web services, mobile backend, big data).\n\nFirst, we need to answer the burning question \"Why go reactive in the first place?\" (Hint: performance is not the primary reason). After an overview of the reactive programming landscape on the JVM, Android and in the browser, we will go into a live coding session, introducing the reactive programming model using the light and efficient Reactor Core 3.0 library.\n\nWe’ll complete coding labs that will teach us how to use the built-in reactive types like Flux and Mono, which are at the heart of what's achieving Reactor: a powerful and concise Reactive eXtensions API based on JDK8 and Reactive Streams. We’ll apply those concepts to concrete use cases and show the power of Reactor operators such as cache, retry, timeout, etc.\n\nBrian Clozel\nSpring Framework and Spring Boot team member, focusing on web-related stuff. Lead developer of Sagan, the Spring reference app that powers http://spring.io\n\nSébastien Deleuze\nSébastien works at Pivotal as a Spring Framework and Reactor commiter. He mostly works on Spring MVC, the upcoming Spring Framework 5 Reactive programming support and Spring Boot + Kotlin integration. He is also part of Mix-IT conference staff crew.\n\n[DYM-1744]"
