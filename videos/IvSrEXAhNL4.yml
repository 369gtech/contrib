title: 'Private Algorithms with Minimal Space'
language: English
recordingDate: 1622843019
description: "A Google TechTalk, 2020/7/29, presented by Adam Smith, Boston University\nABSTRACT: We show that a classic algorithm for counting distinct elements in small space is differentially private with only small modifications. The result is an algorithm with the same space guarantee as in the nonprivate setting, and only an small additional additive error."
