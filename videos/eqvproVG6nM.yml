title: 'Java in the Air: A Case Study for Java-Based Environment Monitoring Stations'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433255013
description: "Environment and air quality monitoring is a pressing need for public and private institutions. The traditionally large and expensive equipment is now complemented by compact and cost-effective devices that ensure widespread coverage and provide near-real-time readings. This session is a real-world case study of developing Java-based applications to drive and remotely manage cloud-enabled environment monitoring systems. It describes how the challenges posed by these systems are easily overcome when event-based technologies such as Oracle Event Processing for Oracle Java Embedded are combined with the modularity and manageability offered by Eclipse Kura, a Java and OSGi framework for embedded Internet of Things applications.\n\n\nAuthors:\nAndy Gilbert\nAndy has been in the Java Embedded team since 2000 and has been actively working in the the embedded industry for more than 20 years.\nView more trainings by Andy Gilbert at https://www.parleys.com/author/andy-gilbert\n\n Luca Dazi\nNo bio available\nView more trainings by  Luca Dazi at https://www.parleys.com/author/luca-dazi-1\n\nMarco Carrer\nMarco Carrer joined EUROTECH as Chief of Software Engineering after a successful 15-year career in the software industry.
