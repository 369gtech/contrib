description: ".NET Summit 2020 Online Edition https://dotnetsummit.by - the 4th community driven .NET conference dedicated to practical experience of solving business challenges with .NET and technical challenges in .NET application.\n\nIrina Scurtu, Forget about HTTP [EN]\n\nMicroservices should be autonomous and independent, but what happens when your business domain doesn't allow it, and you need to get data from other microservices? You'll soon realize that simple HTTP calls are not enough anymore, or that your app is more brittle than ever and then you switch to messaging. \nWith messaging you need to have a different mindset and be willing to embrace new challenges.\nIn this session, we'll see what other options we have and we'll talk about the benefits or the drawbacks of choosing an approach or another.\n\nGeneral Partner - ISsoft - https://issoft.by"
