title: 'Liz Sander - Lowering the Stakes of Failure with Pre-mortems and Post-mortems - PyCon 2019'
recordingDate: 1557111000
description: "\"Speaker: Liz Sander\n\nFailure can be scary. There are real costs to a company and its users when software crashes, models are inaccurate, or when systems go down. The emotional stakes feel high-- no one wants to be responsible for a failure. We can lower the stakes by creating spaces to learn from failures, and minimize their impact. This talk introduces two ways to address failure: blameless post-mortems, to learn from an incident; and pre-mortems, to identify modes of failure upfront.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2019 and https://github.com/PyCon/2019-slides\""
