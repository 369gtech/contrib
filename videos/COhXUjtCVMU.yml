title: 'DEF CON 29 ICS Village - Sharon Brizinov, Uri Katz - Down Exploiting Vulnerabilities In the OT Cloud'
language: English
recordingDate: 1632164245
description: 'We researched the exploitability of cloud-based management platforms responsible for monitoring industrial control systems (ICS), and developed techniques to exploit vulnerabilities in automation vendor CODESYSâ€™ Automation Server and vulnerabilities in the WAGO PLC platform. Our research mimics the top-down and bottom-up paths an attacker would take to either control a Level 1 device in order to eventually compromise the cloud-based management console, or the reverse, commandeer the cloud in order to manipulate all networked field devices.'
