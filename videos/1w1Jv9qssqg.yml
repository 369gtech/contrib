title: 'Creating Docker Images With Spring Boot'
language: English
recordingDate: 1589980826
description: 'In Spring Boot 2.3, a new feature was added that enables you to create Docker Images from your application using Cloud Native Buildpacks.  This is really valuable because you can now create an immutable artifact that ensures that your application is run in an identical environment from your laptop, to your test environment, to production.  Now imagine if you could get that same level of consistency during actual development as well.  In this video, Ben Hale shows you how to use Spring Boot DevTools, the framework for doing in-process refreshing of Spring Boot applications to quickly iterate within a consistent container when developing locally.'
