description: "DevOps is without doubt one of the hottest topics in IT right now, and everyone from vendors, senior management and IT professionals are rushing headlong to “Doing DevOps”. Somewhere along the way the message that DevOps is only a means to an end, and not an end in itself, is getting lost. In this presentation Steve from DevOpsGuys will talk about the lessons DevOpsGuys learnt from working with customers to achieve their business goals, by following DevOps philosophies, and how you can avoid falling into some of the pitfalls of “Doing DevOps”.\nDevOps Pro Vilnius 2016 - http://goo.gl/D9eDT7"
