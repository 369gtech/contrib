language: Spanish
recordingDate: 1598916192
description: 'When I took over maintaining Mongoose after a short Twitter exchange in April 2014, I had no idea what to expect. Through some combination of luck, persistence, and support, Mongoose grew over 100x in terms of monthly downloads and became the most downloaded database framework on npm over the years that followed. In this talk, I''ll cover what I''ve learned about how to be an effective maintainer, as well as several fun experiences I''ve had along the way.'
