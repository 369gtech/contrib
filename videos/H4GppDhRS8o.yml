title: 'Send your app to rehab - Testing React Native apps with Detox - Alejandro Ortega + Erlend Halvorsen'
recordingDate: 1574260372
description: 'Getting started with end-to-end testing is easy, the difficult part is getting them to run consistently, and in a timely manner. Most of us have at some point or another tried and failed at getting end-to-end testing to work. Usually the tests end up flaky or take forever (in the literal sense) to finish. Detox is a cross platform, framework agnostic test automation library for iOS and Android that tries to solve some of these problems, but is it the cure weâ€™ve been waiting for?'
