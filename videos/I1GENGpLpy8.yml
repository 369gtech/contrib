language: English
recordingDate: 1433245688
description: "The Spock unit testing framework is on the verge of a 1.0 release and has already proven to be the next-generation thinking on how to test Java production code.  Using Spock is hands-down the best way for developers to mock and test Java applications. One of Spockâ€™s great features is the ability to write your own custom extensions. This session is a fast-paced (not for beginners), code-centric overview of how to use the advanced features in Spock, including custom extensions and interceptors.\n\n\nAuthor:\nKen Sipe\nKen Sipe is a Cloud Solution Architect at Mesosphere, focused on helping companies simplify the development and operation of large scale infrastructure and distributed systems with the Mesosphere Stack.
