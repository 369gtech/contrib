description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2017\n—\nI've spent the last few years watching Facebook's C++ codebase grow by several orders of magnitude. Despite constantly improving abstractions, constantly improving tooling, frequent internal courses, and ongoing internal discussion, there are bug-patterns we simply cannot stop from being reintroduced into our code. My hope is to show some of the most common (and infamous) bugs in our history, and the surprising complexity that arises in some apparently simple situations. \n\nThis talk serves the dual purpose of educating the intermediate (and perhaps the occasional advanced) C++ programmer about some really nasty common pitfalls, as well as serves as a plea to experts to help further improve the language, libraries, and best practices to help educate and eradicate some of these problematic patterns.\n— \nLouis Brandy: Engineering Director, Facebook\n\nMy team is responsible for the overall health of the Facebook C++ codebase, both the tools and the libraries. We work on: compilers, static/dynamic analysis, linters, large scale changes, and the core libraries.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
