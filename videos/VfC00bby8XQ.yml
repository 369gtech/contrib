description: "Java's most ubiquitous library is getting an update! And this is the time to see what's new and weigh in on its course.\n\nThis talk will...\n\n* show you how to write tests with JUnit 5\n* walk you through the changes compared to JUnit 4\n* present the new architecture\n* discuss compatibility with previous JUnit versions, IDEs, and other testing tools\n\nBe careful, though: You might end up with an urge to start using it right away.\n\nNicolai Parlog is a thirty year old boy, as the narrator would put it, who has found his passion in software development. He constantly reads, thinks, and writes about it, and codes for a living as well as for fun.\n\nHe works as at Disy, Germany's leading provider for spatial and environmental IT-solutions, where he improves the flagship product. He started blogging in September 2014 and has since been published on InfoQ, JAXenter, and Voxxed (amongst others).\n\n[PPQ-9247]"
