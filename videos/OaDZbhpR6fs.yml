description: "Every year, the Eclipse simultaneous release brings together the hard work of dozens of open source projects into a single coordinated release. Most people think of Eclipse as a Java IDE; for the IDE crowd, this year’s Mars release introduces changes in the look and feel of Eclipse, a new installer and setup experience, support for Gradle, enhanced content assist, and more. This session walks through some of the new IDE features and surveys some of the other technology being developed by open source projects at Eclipse, including application frameworks, runtime technology, and modeling tools. It also highlights some of the features coming with next year’s Eclipse Neon release.\n\nSpeakers:\nWayne Beaton, Director of Open Source Projects, The Eclipse Foundation\nWayne fills the dual roles of Director of Open Source Projects and Evangelist at the Eclipse Foundation. He spends his days working with the many Eclipse projects, learning about Eclipse technology, and telling the community what he’s learned. He has over twenty years of professional software development experience, is a content review committee member for JavaOne, a member of the JSR 376 expert group, long time contributor to Eclipse open source projects, and regular presenter at JavaOne, JavaPolis/Devoxx, JAX, and EclipseCon. You can probably find him wandering around the conference muttering something about Smalltalk. When not working, he spends his time watching his kids play hockey at one of the many local arenas."
