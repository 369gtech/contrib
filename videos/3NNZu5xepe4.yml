description: "Michael Śliwiński: No Office - work is not a place to go, it’s a thing that you do - how to build your company without building your office.\n\nThe point of the presentation is to talk about all the practical aspects of running an all-remote company and why it might not make sense to rent an office space for your company/startup and why by working all-remote you can have a better team:\n\nhow you can make your team feel more connected... even though they don’t share the same physical space\nhow to run meetings, how to run projects, how to get stuff done together in a “no office” team\nwhen meeting in person matters and when it really doesn’t - how to build a company based on trust and not just control\nwhy when you’re together you’re wasting time and having only an illusion of control - how to structure communication in your team\nwhy a physical office can be an additional tool for your team/company but is not a requirement - why you can hire from anywhere and how it benefits you\nwhy you can save money on rent and save time on commute\n+ lots of practical tips of running an all remote team from a founder of Nozbe, who’s been doing this for the last 11 years + more tips from other companies who’re doing it as well (Automattic, Buffer, MySQL, etc.)\n\nThe talk will be very practical with lots of tips and tricks - it will also challenge the audience’s assumptions of the importance of a physical office - the common misconceptions of why “we really need an office”.\n\nThe speech was given on 2018-05-23 at infoShare 2018 (Inspire Stage) in Gdańsk.\n\nMore info: http://infoshare.pl \nFollow us: https://facebook.com/infosharepl\nhttps://twitter.com/infosharepl\nhttps://instagram.com/infoshare/\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/1272775/\nhttps://plus.google.com/+infoshare/"
