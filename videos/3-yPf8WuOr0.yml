recordingDate: 1368615244
description: "Munich Erlang Factory Lite 2013\nhttp://www.erlang-factory.com/conference/Munich2013/talks\n\nCard processing is a industry requiring backend systems of a certain type. Much like telecom infrastructure, it's expected to deliver 24/7 all days of the year. Response times, scalability and fault-tolerance are critical elements in a successful backend system supporting real-time card transactions. What could be a better choice than Erlang?\n\nAt SumUp we enable card payments using mobile devices. When a purchase is made through our android or iOS apps, our Erlang backend handles the card processing. Fault-tolerance is our top priority. Downtime is out of the question."
