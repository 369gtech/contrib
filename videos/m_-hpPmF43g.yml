description: "Google Tech Talks\nMarch, 24 2008\n\nABSTRACT\n\nOn December 18th, 2007, HP Launched an open source project called FOSSology. A month later on January 24th, 2008 HP, along with the Linux Foundation and several other\nprominent organizations announced a new \"Web Community\" called FOSSBazaar. At a\nhigh level, these two projects will appeal to different audiences and their growth will\ncertainly take different paths. However, both projects have been created for the same\nfundamental reason; to accelerate the understanding and adoption of free and open source\nsoftware by businesses, institutions, and governments.\n\nIf you are a manager responsible for the procurement or development of software assets,\nthen FOSSBazaar and FOSSology can greatly simplify your life. If you are a developer\nwanting to use and/or participate in open source projects, then FOSSBazaar can help you\nget your management's approval. If you are a researcher interested in studying open\nsource, then FOSSBazaar and FOSSology are great resources to further your work. This\ntalk will describe the vision, direction, and current state of the FOSSology and\nFOSSBazaar projects and (of course) be spattered with a \"pitch\" on how you can get\ninvolved.\n\nSpeaker: Philip Robb\nPhil Robb is General Manager of FOSSBazaar.org; a website and community dedicated\nto improving the governance and adoption of free and open source software within\nenterprises, institutions, and governments. Phil is also a section manager at Hewlett\nPackard leading their Open Source Programs Office. In that role Phil manages several\nproduct development teams focused on open source solutions and governance including\nthe FOSSology project (at FOSSology.org). Phil is also responsible for HP's Open\nSource Review Board which is the governing body within HP for all open source\nsoftware usage and deployment. Prior to joining HP in 2001, Phil held senior\nmanagement and technical positions at Critical Path, Fisher Scientific, Motorola, and\nHoneywell-Bull. Phil received a Bachelor's of Science degree in Management\nInformation Systems from Bowling Green State University, and attended Colorado State\nUniversity toward a Masters degree in Computer Science."
