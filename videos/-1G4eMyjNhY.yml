description: 'We are entering an era where interactions with computers will drastically change. Standard I/O will be replaced by solutions that interact with natural language either spoken or written. The signs of this change are the numerous bots that appear everywhere. The most popular are chatbots. This session focusses on bots, to access them with any client and to create meaningful dialogs respecting the language and emotion of the user.'
