title: 'Bank to the Future: Bitcoin meets Hadoop by Daniel Cook'
recordingDate: 1522160203
description: 'We’ve long assumed that in order to move money from one account to another reliably that we need to employ transactions to wrap the debit from one account and the credit to another. The blockchain has challenged this thinking, recording all transactions on a ledger in an append only manner. Let’s take the ideas of bitcoin but apply them with the original append only king Hadoop to build a bank that can scale its processing to millions of transactions per second and can store petabytes of data. And for good measure we’ll look at Apache Kafka, the Hadoop Distributed File System, Spark and Accumulo along the way.'
