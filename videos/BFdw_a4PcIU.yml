title: 'Developing large-scale machine learning algorithms on Amazon SageMaker'
recordingDate: 1554520002
description: "Speaker: Amir Sadoughi, Senior Software Development Engineer, Amazon Web Services\n\nAt AWS, we continue to strive to enable builders to build cutting-edge technologies faster in a secure, reliable, and scalable fashion. Machine learning is one such transformational technology that is top of mind not only for business decision makers but also developers and data scientists.\n\nAmazon SageMaker enables machine learning developers and data scientists to build, train, and deploy machine learning models quickly and easily, at any scale. In this talk, we will dive deep to discuss the software development behind the Amazon SageMaker built-in algorithms, including implementation, integration, testing, and benchmarking. We will present our learnings from tackling the challenges of implementing scalable machine learning algorithms that work across various training and inference requirements. We will also discuss how users can build and vend their own machine learning algorithms and models as part of the AWS Marketplace for Machine Learning and use them with Amazon SageMaker.â€‹"
