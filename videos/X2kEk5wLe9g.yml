description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nKubeDirector - Deploying Complex Stateful Applications on Kubernetes - Joel Baxter & Thomas Phelan, Hewlett Packard Enterprise  \n\nKubernetes was originally designed to deploy cloud-native stateless applications.   Features such as StatefulSets and Persistent Volumes have been added that make it possible to deploy some stateful applications on Kubernetes. However, deploying and running complex stateful applications remains a difficult task -- even with tools such as Kustomize, Helm, and KubeFlow. KubeDirector is an open source Apache project designed to address these challenges. It utilizes the Kubernetes custom resource functionality and API extensions to deploy and manage complex, stateful, scale-out applications.  This session will: describe the limitations of existing tools for complex stateful applications, provide an overview of the KubeDirector architecture and how it overcomes these limitations, and demonstrate how to author the metadata to deploy a stateful application on Kubernetes with KubeDirector  \n\nhttps://sched.co/UaaF"
