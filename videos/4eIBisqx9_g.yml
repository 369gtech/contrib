description: "You Only Look Once - this object detection algorithm is currently the state of the art, outperforming R-CNN and it's variants. I'll go into some different object detection algorithm improvements over the years, then dive into YOLO theory and a programmatic implementation using Tensorflow!\n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/YOLO_Object_Detection\n\nPlease Subscribe!
