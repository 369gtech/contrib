title: 'Eric Ma, Hugo Bowne-Anderson - Bayesian Data Science by Simulation - PyCon 2019'
recordingDate: 1556807155
description: "\"Speakers: Eric Ma, Hugo Bowne-Anderson\n\nThis tutorial is an Introduction to Bayesian data science through the lens of simulation or hacker statistics. We will become familiar with many common probability distributions through i) matching them to real-world stories & ii) simulating them. We will work with joint/conditional probabilities, Bayes Theorem, prior/posterior distributions and likelihoods, while seeing their applications in real-world data analyses. We’ll see the utility of Bayesian inference in parameter estimation and comparing groups and we’ll wrap up with a dive into the wonderful world of probabilistic programming.\n\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2019 and https://github.com/PyCon/2019-slides\""
