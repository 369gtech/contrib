language: English

description: "Back in the old days, it was common to write rule-based systems. Systems that do; data - [rules] -labels.\n\nNowadays, it's much more fashionable to use machine learning instead. Something like; (labels, data) - [model] - rules.\n\nIt might be a good time to ask ourselves, is this a better approach? Or have we lost something while in this transition?\n\nEVENT / SPEAKER:\nPyData Eindhoven 2020 / Vincent Warmerdam\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nPyData Organizers provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish PyData talks on Coding Tech\n\nCREIDTS:\nPyData YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOjD18EJYcsBog4IozkF_7w"
