recordingDate: 1496142200
description: "Visit the largest developers congress in Europe: WeAreDevelopers World Congress, 16 - 18 May 2018 in Vienna, Austria.\n\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/congress/\n\nI go mad when I hear: ‘We have no time for tests’. Learn why that statement is so wrong and how to make tests a ‘must have’ in your workflow. It’s a common mistake that tests take lots of time, while actually the truth is that initial manual testing is the overhead. The presentation will be focused on how to incorporate tests into your regular workflow, and why you shouldn’t write tests after your application code. The presentation will be also filled with personal experiences and excuses I’ve heard over the years for not writing tests.\n\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/wearedevelopers.org/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/wearedevs/\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/wearedevelopers.org/"
