description: "Open Source projects are no strangers to collaborating remotely. However, as technology has advanced an explosion of streaming technologies has pushed community interactions into an entirely new dynamic environment. CNCF Projects need the skills to embrace more live-streaming and multimedia based approaches.\n\nThis webinar is intended to show CNCF Member projects how best to use technologies like YouTube, OBS, and Twitch in order to engage their communities.\n\nExpected audience: K8s streaming team, TGIK hosts, CNCF member projects looking to move their meetings to a streaming format. CNCF member projects looking to run their own office hours. Anyone who now needs to be a pro (competent?) at livestreaming."
