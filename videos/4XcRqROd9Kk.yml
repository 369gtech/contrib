title: 'Live Refactoring Session: Getting rid of dirty code by Marcus Biel'
recordingDate: 1581886375
description: "In this live hacking I will refactor a small Sudoku Brute-Force Solver. The code is anything but bad, but its age shows. In short sessions we want to give the legacy code a rejuvenating treatment. In doing this, I want to introduce you to my personal approach when refactoring untested legacy code. Among many other things, we will cover:\n\nCode readability\nComments\nGeneral OO\nEncapsulation\nCoupling\nCohesion\nImmutable Classes\nModern IO\nJava 8 Streams\nI recommend that you familiarize yourself with the Sudoku rules and check the original code beforehand:\n\nhttps://github.com/fzoli/Sudoku/blob/master/src/java/sudoku/chan/SudokuSolver.java\n\nhttps://github.com/fzoli/Sudoku/blob/master/src/java/sudoku/chan/Grid.java\n\nMarcus Biel\nClean Code Academy\n\nRecorded at Jfokus 2020 in Stockholm 4th of february\nhttp://www.jfokus.se"
