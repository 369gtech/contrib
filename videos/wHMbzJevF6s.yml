description: "We’ve been using the same 12 column grids on the web now for over a decade. What started with a few blog posts by an influential couple of design bloggers in 2006 found its way into new (at the time) CSS frameworks and that was that. However, there is way more to designing grids than choosing how many columns you want. Lucky for us, with Grid Layout, we have a powerful tool to realise those grids.\n\nThis talk will delve into grid design theory and make it applicable for today’s web. We’ll tackle how you systematically make decisions about how to approach grid design and resulting layout. How you create connectedness between design elements and how a well-designed grid can help answer a plethora of design problems in your process. Mark will bridge the gap between grid design and layout theory and modern web design that you can put into practice tomorrow. Together we might just move the web on from 12 columns for the next decade.\n\nAbout Mark: http://www.markboulton.co.uk\n\nMore about CSS Day: https://cssday.nl or https://twitter.com/cssdayconf\nReceive conference announcements in your inbox: https://cssday.nl/subscribe"
