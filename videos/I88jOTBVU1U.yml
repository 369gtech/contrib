description: "Domain-Driven Design Europe 2019\nhttps://dddeurope.com\nhttps://twitter.com/ddd_eu\n\nAn Experience Report - Using DDD in a Real Life Project \nIn this talk I will show you that DDD isn't just theory, but that it is actually very valuable in real life. I will do this by sharing my experiences from a about a 3 years project where we exploited DDD to replace a part of a big monolithic business application in Equinor. I will tell about how we worked in our team during the project, what we achieved, and how DDD played an important role in these achievements.\n\nBiography\nAnita is a UX passionate software developer. She has more than 20 years of experience with creating complex business critical applications, mainly for Equinor ASA, a huge Norwegian energy company. \n\nAnita has experience from all parts of the software design process, lately focusing more and more on software architecture and hands on coding. She enjoys spending her workdays using her knowledge of the users and their domain and applying this insight toward the utilization of Domain Driven Design principles in the process of implementing new software solutions."
