description: "Lily Wang\n\nSurprisingly, we can approximate matter as a bunch of balls on springs and learn things about our bodies and the world. This talk will look at the different stages of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and how Python is changing everything.\n\nhttps://2019.pycon-au.org/talks/the-universe-as-balls-and-springs-molecular-dynamics-in-python\n\nPyCon AU, the national Python Language conference, is on again this August in Sydney, at the International Convention Centre, Sydney, August 2 - 6 2019.\n\nVideo licence: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 - https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU\n\nSun Aug  4 13:30:00 2019 at C3.4 & C3.5"
