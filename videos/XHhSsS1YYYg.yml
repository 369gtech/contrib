description: "With the Data-Oriented Tech Stack (DOTS) there is now a different way to code in Unity which enables unprecedented levels of scale and performance. DOTS will revolutionize the way we make games in Unity, so join this Lab to be ready for it! \n\nIn this Lab you are going to get a small taste of how to script in C# using Data-oriented principles, and of how to use the new Entity Component System (ECS) that is coming to Unity as part of DOTS. We will use a small game coded in regular C# MonoBehaviours, and we are going to convert the game to DOTS and swap the scripts with ECS Systems.\n\nAbout:\nCiro Continisio, Technical Evangelist, Unity Technologies\n\nTechnical Evangelist at @unity3d. Also designer/programmer (made @SlybotsFZ, @UFHO2), Regional Organiser for @GlobalGameJam and jammer myself."
