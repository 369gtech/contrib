description: "On this episode of Designing in the Browser, we’re going to take a look at how we can extend the capabilities of vanilla CSS with pre and post-processors with our host Una Kravets. We cover Sass, Post CSS, and even an upcoming technology called CSS Houdini to see how we can have even more power and control over our styling code.\n\nLinks:\nSass Documentation → https://goo.gle/2qPEqFJ\nPostCSS Documentation → https://goo.gle/2CGC0vA\nIs Houdini Ready Yet? → https://goo.gle/2XjQFqe\nMaterial Masonry Demo → https://goo.gle/2OdIveJ\nMaterial Shape Tool → https://goo.gle/2piRKBU\nAngled Corners Demo → https://goo.gle/33PaUhU\n\nDesigning in the Browser → https://goo.gle/2NeLxjI\nSubscribe to Chrome Developers → https://goo.gle/ChromeDevs"
