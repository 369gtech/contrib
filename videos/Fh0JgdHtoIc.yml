description: "(Recorded at Jfokus 2016. http://www.jfokus.com)\n\nHow to defeat feature gluttony?\n\nFeature gluttony is a common sin among IT projects. Customers deliver never ending wish list of features they want. However, the key is not to build everything, but only things that are really needed. Learn how to defeat feature gluttony by... saying NO ;) What will you learn? First of all how to maintain product road map in non-linear way (so no one assign the deadlines to it ;)), how to create mystical MVP and how to reduce the scope :) Final, and the most surprising element is... learning how to talk about removing features for the application with business people. All those 'cunning' techniques allow you SAY NO to excessive features! Remember, there is always a way to make your application lean!\n\nKasia Mrowca, Mrowca LTD\n\nKasia is a product magician, IT passionate, agile & lean enthusiast, PhD candidate & big conference junkie.
