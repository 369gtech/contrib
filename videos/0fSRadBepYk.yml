description: "Linking software architecture with code requires collaboration from both sides, says Simon Brown. Architects need to be on code teams and developers need to step back to see the bigger picture.\n\nWatch more from the O'Reilly Software Architecture Conference: http://goo.gl/lXpXnG\n\nSimon is an independent consultant and helps organisations to build better software by adopting a lightweight, pragmatic approach to software architecture. He is the creator of the C4 software architecture model and the author of Software Architecture for Developers – a developer-friendly guide to software architecture, technical leadership and the balance with agility. Simon regularly speaks at software development conferences around the world and, in 2013, he won the IEEE Software sponsored SATURN 2013 “Architecture in Practice” Presentation Award for his presentation about the conflict between agile and architecture. Simon lives in Jersey (the largest of the Channel Islands) and his client list spans over 20 countries, including organisations ranging from small technology startups through to global household names. He still codes too.\n\nFor more information, visit: http://oreil.ly/1Cyt9nt\nSoftware architecture is a massive multidisciplinary subject, covering many roles and responsibilities, which makes it challenging to teach because so much context is required for every subject. It's also a fast-moving discipline, where entire suites of best practices become obsolete overnight.\n\nThe O'Reilly Software Architecture Conference is a new event designed to provide the necessary professional training that software architects and aspiring software architects need to succeed. A unique event, it covers the full scope of a software architect's job, from IT to leadership and business skills. It also provides a forum for networking and hearing what other professionals have learned in real-world experiences.\n\nStay Connected to O'Reilly Media by Email - http://goo.gl/YZSWbO\nFollow O'Reilly Media:\nhttp://plus.google.com/+oreillymedia\nhttps://www.facebook.com/OReilly\nhttps://twitter.com/OReillyMedia"
