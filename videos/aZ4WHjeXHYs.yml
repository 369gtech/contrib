description: "How we scale Agile at Revolut and why it is the key factor to growth\n\nRevolut grew from 0 in 2015 to millions of retail customers now. We have 200,000 business customer applications for Revolut for Business so far and we get 1500 new every day. The company grew from 700 employees last year to 1400 now with 200+ joining every month. Agile is in the DNA of the way we do things here at Revolut. I will share with you what we mean by Agile at Revolut (spoiler alert: we are NOT using Scrum), what elements were key to enable the growth, and how we manage Agile at scale. If you are a startup you will learn how to set up yourself for growth. If you are working on projects or in enterprise you will learn what worked for us and what didnâ€™t so that you could experiment with some of those in your organizations."
