This is a complex problem in itself. On top of that, we would like to support querying a distributed graph database. This talk describes the life of a query in Memgraph. Follow the process from reading a query as a character string, through planning query operations for distributed execution and finally to the execution itself.\n\n\nRead the full abstract: http://codesync.global/speaker/teon-banek/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - TEON BANEK\nSenior software engineer at Memgraph Ltd.\n\nTeon was born in Zagreb, 1991. Ever since he was a child, Teon was very fond of computers and started programming at an early age. He finished his Master's degree in Computer Science at Faculty of Electrical Engineer and Computing in Zagreb, 2015. His interests developed towards computer graphics and programming languages, especially Lisp. Other than programming, Teon's hobbies are fencing, board-gaming and enjoying a nice meal of lasagne.\n\nMore on Teon Banek: http://codesync.global/speaker/teon-banek/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE MESH LDN 18\nCode Mesh LDN is powered by Code Sync.
