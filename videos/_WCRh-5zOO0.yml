language: English
recordingDate: 1601306593
description: "Experimentation is a powerful tool to gather actionable insights from your audience, but it can also be hard to cultivate a mindset that prioritises experimentation if it’s not something that you’re accustomed to.\n\nWe’ll think about how to identify when an experiment could be used, explore some experimentation techniques, how to set the bounds of the experiment to ensure your results are accurate."
