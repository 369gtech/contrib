description: "Cloud Foundry let developers focus on code while leaving everything around it to the platform. But managing the platform involves lots of moving parts. Add the infrastructure to the puzzle, and you have more metrics than most people can handle. In addition, the infrastructure team, platform team, and developer teams are often disconnected. This leads to finger-pointing and long MTTR. Hear from a customer how Wavefront by VMware offers a unique approach to cross-layer correlation in a Cloud Foundry environment to automatically pinpoint problem spots among hundreds of components and tens of thousands of metrics. In this session, we'll show you hands-on how to trace actual real-life issues from an application issue, through traces down to the platform and infrastructure layers.\n\nLearn more: https://pv.tl/35Xt2rp\n\nSpeakers: Pontus Rydin: Technology Evangelist, VMware, Gordana Neskovic: Sr PMM, VMware, Hristo Dimitrov: Sr. Manager, VMware\n\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2019\nSlides: Coming Soon"
