description: "Randy Shoup, Consulting CTO\n\nDevOps is no longer just for Internet unicorns any more. Today many large enterprises are transitioning from the slow and siloed traditional IT approach to modern DevOps practices, and getting substantial improvements in agility, velocity, scalability, and efficiency. But this transition is not without its challenges and pitfalls, and those of us who have led this journey have the scar tissue to prove it.\n\nA successful transition to DevOps practices ultimately involves changes to organization, to culture, and to architecture. Organizationally, we want to create multi-skilled teams with end-to-end ownership and shared on-call responsibilities. Culturally, we want to prioritize solving problems and improving the product over closing tickets. Architecturally, we want to move to an infrastructure with independently testable and deployable components.\n\nThe ten practical lessons outlined in this session synthesize the speaker’s experiences leading teams at eBay, Google, and KIXEYE, as well as from his current consulting practice."
