title: 'Do microservices dream about CQRS ES, Kafka Stream and BPMN ? (Ce?dric Vidal, Nicolas Romanetti)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1541668608
description: "Like many other software vendors Quicksign has chosen to migrate its SAAS platform from an on-premise monolith to a microservices platform in the Cloud.\n\nUsing a modern tech stack including Kafka, Kubernetes, the Camunda BPMN engine and some in-house development we have built a Kappa CQRS-ES multi-tenant platform able to execute BPMN workflows that can discover and consume any microservice registered in a Kubernetes backed extended registry that allows content type and protocol negotiation.\n\nOur platform leverages Kafka Streams to dynamically generate from a reactive stream of workflow events a bespoke REST-API (HATEOAS) representation so as to ease our customers’ integration effort and allow fast iterations.\n\nWe propose to briefly introduce the audience to BPMN and then expose the rationale that led us to build this architecture, its advantages in terms of agility and scalability.\n\nVoxxed Days Microservices 2018: 2 days conference (+1 optional workshops day) only on Microservices. \n\nFollow us on :\nWebsite : https://voxxeddays.com/microservices (bit.ly/vxdmicro)\nTwitter : https://twitter.com/vxdmicroservice\nLinkedin : https://www.linkedin.com/in/voxxed-days-microservices-906115164\nKeep in touch : https://t.co/pxf7cHZOpl\n\n#developers #conference #microservices"
