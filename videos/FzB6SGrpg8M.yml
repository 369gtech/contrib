Starting from the humble CSS triangle, this talk will explore tricks and techniques for implementing geometric designs with pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Crafting shapes in code makes for flexible, easy to maintain websites and will give you a taste of some of the coolest emerging front-end techniques, like CSS transforms, SVG and canvas.\n\nBrenna O’Brien\nLead Developer & Instructor, HackerYou\nhttps://twitter.com/brnnbrn\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
