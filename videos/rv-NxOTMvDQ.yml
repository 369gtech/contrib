title: 'TestContainers – integration testing without the hassle (Sergei Egorov, Zalando)'

description: "Unit testing is fine, but without a proper integration testing, especially if you work with external resources like databases and other services, you might not know how your application will behave once it has been deployed to the real environment.\n\nBefore the Docker, configuring the environment for integration testing was painful – people were using fake database implementations, mocking servers, usually it was not cross-platform as well.\nHowever, now we can quickly prepare the environment with Docker for our tests.\n\nIn this talk I would like to spread the word about TestContainers ( https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java ) – a Java library that supports JUnit tests, providing lightweight, throwaway instances of common databases, Selenium web browsers, or anything else that can run in a Docker container.\n\nCome and learn why Apache, Zalando, ZeroTurnaround, Zipkin and others already decided to use TestContainers for their integration testing needs!"
