description: "Brent provides a live demonstration reversing engineering 17 or more unknown passenger vehicle CAN networks in under 10 minutes using new automated techniques. These unsupervised techniques are over 90% accurate and consistent when tested using production CAN networks and different driving conditions. He then introduces the Python and R code used for the demo and posted to his public GitHub repository at https://github.com/brent-stone/CAN_Reverse_Engineering. The Dissertation explaining how the code works is also posted.\n\nBrent Stone\nDr. Brent Stone is a Cyber officer with the U.S. Military. His professional experience includes 10 years of IT and cyber work in North America, the Middle East, and Asia. The focus of his PhD research was developing AI methods to help security researchers overcome the 'security through obscurity' used in the automotive industry. He presented initial findings at the 2018 IEEE Connected and Automated Vehicles Symposium and is an active member of the Open Garage's car hacking group. He holds a B.S. in Computer Science from West Point, M.S. in IT security from Carnegie-Mellon, and PhD in Computer Science from the Air Force Institute of Technology.\n\nGithub: https://github.com/brent-stone"
