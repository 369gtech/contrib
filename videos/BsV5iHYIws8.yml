description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nUsing Service Mesh in Multi-Cluster Kubernetes Environment for DR Use Case - Jun Wei, Equinix \n\nMany organizations have adopted microservice, Kubernetes and service mesh. In a multi-cloud & hybrid Kubernetes environment, the underneath network metrics (e.g. delay, jitters, etc.) could have a significant impact on service to service response time in service mesh. For example, latency from physical network is not captured by Istio service mesh, and it is not visible in traces. Therefore it is not easy to pinpoint whether a service response time issue is related to service or the network. We propose to use the metrics from underneath network infrastructure, e.g. delay, jitter, etc., together with Istio measurement for better observability. Such combined measures allow us to optimize service deployment in different scenarios. Using Istio service mesh and network metrics, we will demonstrate a use case for DR failover over 3 multi-cloud/hybrid Kubernetes clusters. \n\nhttps://sched.co/abZq"
