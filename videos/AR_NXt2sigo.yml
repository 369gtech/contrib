description: "Google Tech Talks\r\nOctober 8, 2008\r\n\r\nActivity States Framework: A Theoretical Framework for the Analysis of Actual Human Collaboration on the Web\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nThe development of \"activity states framework\" came from our research motivation to understand how people punctuate events and induce communication protocols (knowing to communicate through which Web tools,\r\nwith whom, and when) during Web collaboration. With such understanding, it would enable the prediction of people's responses (e.g. the most likely tool(s) to use) within different situations (e.g, organizing a meeting,\r\nclarify project budget). Such prediction can help us to know what tools to build to support the chains of Web activities during Web collaboration. But how do we go about discovering and understanding this? Several findings from cognitive studies suggest that people re-enact and re-sequence their responses when in similar contexts of communications. Can similar observations be made on communication exchanges? And if so, how does one process the communications (into data) enabling the study of those re-enacting and re-sequencing patterns? In this talk, I will present an \"activity-states framework\" which is concerned with the formal analysis of human dialogues with the Web medium to enable the study of those patterns\r\n\r\nSpeaker: Nik Nailah Binti Abdullah"
