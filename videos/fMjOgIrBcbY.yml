description: "Yan Cui: Microservice principles for Serverless\n\nYan Cui, Principal Engineer at DAZN\n\nYan is an experienced engineer who has worked with AWS for ~10 years. Yan is an internationally recognized speaker, and the instructor for Production-Ready Serverless and co-author of F# Deep Dives. In his spare time he also keeps an active blog\n\nApplying the best parts of Microservice to Serverless\nWhenever a new paradigm comes along, we often cast the previous incumbents as relics to be forgotten by history, only to then repeat the same mistakes as they once did. On the surface Serverless has revolutionised how we build and run software, but deep down we are still building microservices and face the same challenges. As more of us adopt Serverless and build increasingly complex systems using this new paradigm, it's important to take a moment to reflect on the lessons others have learnt about building microservices and how they can be applied to our Serverless applications. In this talk, we'll look at testing strategies, how to build observability into the system, configuration management and how to make our systems resilient to failures."
