Go behind the scenes with James, AIY Projects engineer, as he assembles the Voice Kit and uses it to control his own model train. We can’t wait to see the awesome and unexpected ways you will use voice in your own projects. Use #AIYprojects on social media to help us find your inventions and let us know what you’d like to see next.
