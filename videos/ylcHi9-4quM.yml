description: "Google TechTalks\nFebruary 24, 2006\n\nDennis Strelow\n\nRobust motion from monocular image measurements would be an enabling technology for Mars rover, micro air vehicle, and search and rescue robot navigation; and for modeling complex environments from video.\nWhile algorithms exist for estimating six degree of freedom motion from monocular image measurements, motion from image measurements suffers from inherent problems. These include sensitivity to incorrect or insufficient image feature tracking; sensitivity to camera modeling and calibration errors; and long-term drift in scenarios with missing observations, i.e., where image features enter and leave the field of view.\nThe integration of image..."
