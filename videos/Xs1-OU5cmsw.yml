title: 'DataDevOps for the Modern Data Warehouse on Microsoft Azure - Lace Lofranco'
recordingDate: 1572944266
description: "The Modern Data Warehouse architecture is a response to the emergence of Big Data, Machine Learning and Advanced Analytics. DevOps is a key aspect of successfully operationalizing a multi-source Modern Data Warehouse.\n\nWhile there are many examples of how to build CI/CD pipelines for traditional applications, applying these concepts to Big Data Analytical Pipelines is a relatively new and emerging area. In this demo heavy session, we will see how to apply DevOps principles to an end-to-end Data Pipeline built on the Microsoft Azure Data Platform with technologies such as Data Factory, Databricks, Data Lake Gen2, and AzureDevOps.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks, courses, and conferences in the following links:\nhttps://ndcsydney.com/\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
