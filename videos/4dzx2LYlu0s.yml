description: "Getting Started with Knative: The Way to Build Serverless - Bryan Friedman & Brian McClain, Pivotal\n\nThe open source serverless framework space is crowded and complex. Each unique offering approaches functions differently, with varying methods for triggering, scaling, event formatting. But one thing that most everybody can agree on is to build on top of Kubernetes. With that as the only common ground though, there is still too much fragmentation for developers to wade through when deciding on the right open source FaaS solution.\n\nThat's where Knative comes in. An open source project from Google, Pivotal, and other industry leaders, Knative provides a set of common tooling on top of Kubernetes to help developers build functions. It extends Kubernetes by combining Istio with Custom Resource Definitions to enable a higher-level of abstraction for developers. This brings support for things like source-to-container builds, autoscaling, routing, and event sourcing. In this session, we will explore all the components of Knative together and demonstrate how it can be used to effectively deliver a serverless experience to developers on any cloud.\n\nAbout Bryan Friedman\nBryan Friedman is a Director of Product Marketing for Pivotal.
