title: 'Math for Game Developers - Detecting Cheaters (Dependent Events)'
recordingDate: 1416513610
description: "Dependent events are events where knowing the result of one of them changes the probability that the other will occur. We can use this to discover cheaters in our game.\n\nNew video every Thursday. Question? Leave a comment below, or ask me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/VinoBS\n\nEXERCISES:\n\n1. What is P(C|-), the probability that the player is cheating given he tested negative? Why does P(C|-) + P(C|+) not equal 1?\n\n2. What probability P(something) would you need so that P(C|+) + P(something) = 1?\n\n3. Tricky: What is the probability that the player is cheating given the software tests positive for cheats on two different occasions? You can assume the two different occasions are independent of each other."
