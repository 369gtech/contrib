description: "The opportunity exists for organizations in every industry to unlock the power of iterative, big data analysis for new applications such as digital marketing optimization and social network analysis that improve the bottom line. Big data analysis is not just the ability to analyze large volumes of data, but also the ability to analyze more varieties of data and perform more complex analysis than is possible with more traditional technologies. But it doesn't have to be as complicated as it sounds. This session will show you how you can bring the science of data to the art of business and empower more business users and analysts to operationalize insights and drive results. You'll see examples of how data science is applied by making emerging analytic technologies more accessible to businesses and easily managed by enterprise architects across retail, financial services, and media companies.\n\nRandy Lea\n\nTeradata Corporation\n\nRandy S.
