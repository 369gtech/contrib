description: "The Microsoft Graph Toolkit is a group of reusable, *framework-agnostic* components and authentication providers for working with Microsoft Graph. You can add components to existing applications, and work in any modern browser. Join us as we chat with Beth Pan about the toolkit. In the previous session we chatted on how you can incorporate otherwise complex functionality, including authentication, with just a few lines of code. This time, we will talk about advanced technics, tips, and tricks in customizing and configuring Microsoft Graph Toolkit components.\n\nMicrosoft Graph Toolkit playground: https://aka.ms/WebWed/mgtdevplayground\nDevelop apps with the Microsoft Graph Toolkit: https://aka.ms/WebWed/mgt-learn-1"
