description: "When a former employee of a hospital staffing agency was accused of stealing CRM data and supplying it to a competitor, Cozen Oâ€™Connor was hired to assist the U.S. Department of Justice in prosecuting the employee and filing a civil case against the complicit competing agency. Faced with an expedited trial schedule and two million documents, the firm took a bold approach to quickly comb through the relevant documents returned by the system. In this session, you will learn about the rapidly growing world of e-discovery as well as technology and method that make the effective review possible in just two weeks. You will have a chance to see the backstage of how engineers empower legal teams to organize data, discover the truth and act on it.\n\nDevConf 2017 (http://devconf.pl) \n13-15 September 2017"
