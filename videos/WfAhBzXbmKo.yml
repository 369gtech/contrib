description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nSponsored Session: Rancher - Kubernetes GitOps with Rancher Continuous Delivery  \n\nAs the number of Kubernetes clusters under management increases, application owners and cluster operators need a programmatic way to approach cluster management. Rancher CD solves this by creating a git driven engine for applying cluster changes. Declarative code is stored in a git repo. As changes are committed to the repo, linked clusters are automatically updated. Gitops keeps all your clusters consistent, version controlled, and reduces the administrative burden as you scale. Deployment manifests can be defined in Helm, Kustomize or k8s yaml files and can be tailored based on attributes of the target clusters. In this demo, we will walk through getting started with Rancher Continuous Delivery and provide examples of how to leverage this powerful new tool in Rancher 2.5. Topics we’ll cover:  1. An overview of Rancher Continuous Delivery  2. How to configure cluster groups and tie them to Git repositories  3. How to manage deployments on the local cluster  4. How to deploy an application across multiple clusters \n\nhttps://sched.co/ff1V"
