description: "Can We Get There From Here?\r\nAlex Russell (SitePen)\r\n\r\nHTML, HTTP, JavaScript, CSS and most of the web development stack have been often cited as proof that \"worse is better\", but today divergent views of the web are emerging as we find out that that worse isn't *always* better, that ubiquity and openness are assailable advantages, and that the web's derivative value streams already are routing around the flaws in HTML's semantics.\r\n\r\nThis talk looks at the divergent views being fielded today. GWT, Flex, and Silverlight all take the view that the web is a problem to be fixed, giving developers serious power to accomplish more in less time. The other view, embodied by Safari, HTML 5, Gears, and Ajax libraries like Dojo suggests that there is an evolutionary path which still provides a place for upgrades to existing semantics and practice."
