description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM SF 2020 - http://bit.ly/2wpn0SM\n\nGet involved in Code Sync's next conference - https://codesync.global\n\n---\n\nTACTICS AND STRATEGIES FOR SCALABLE ROBUST INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS\nby Carl Hewitt\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nScalable\nRobust\nIntelligent Systems\n\nTALK LEVEL: beginners, intermediate and proficient people\n\nABSTRACT\nThis talk is comprised of two parts: tactics and strategies.\n \nFirst, tactics are discussed how to use Erlang and Elixir for implementing scalable robust concurrency as follows:\n•        Minimizing latency in mailboxes\n•        Implementing holes in a region of mutual exclusion.\n•        Performing cleanup in order to facilitate further progress\n\nSecond, strategies are presented how to implement universal reusable secure intelligent systems in this decade. Reusable Secure Intelligent Systems (RSIS) have the following characteristics:\n·      Interactively acquire information from video, Web pages, hologlasses (electronic glasses with holographic-like overlays), online databases, sensors, articles, human speech and gestures, etc.\n·      Real-time integration of massive pervasively inconsistent information\n·      Close human interaction using hologlasses for interacting with the world and secure mobile communication\n·      Self-informative in the sense of knowing its own goals, plans, history, provenance of its information and having relevant information about its own strengths and weaknesses.\n·      Teachable so that systems can interactively adapt in real-time (instead of relying exclusively on passively attempting to find correlations among inputs).\n·      Reusable enabling an intelligent system to be used by other intelligent systems without having to start over from scratch.\n·      Secure meaning that there are no easy ways to penetrate systems and/or deceive them into taking inappropriate actions.\n·      No closed-form algorithmic solution is possible to implement the above capabilities\n\nChina is racing to develop its own indigenous universal reusable secure intelligent systems as rapidly as possible.\n \nLiftoff is a proposed project for education, science, and technology to implement universal Reusable Secure Intelligent Systems by 2030. Education will be crucial to the success of Project Liftoff because there is an enormous talent shortage.\n\nSlides & full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/carl-hewitt/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - CARL HEWITT\nFounder Actor Model and Inconsistency Robustness.  Designer of first logic programming language.\n\nProfessor Carl Hewitt is known for his scientific work on founding the Actor model of computation, work on Logic in foundations in Computer Science including founding Inconsistency Robust Massive Ontology Services Systems™ (MOSS),  designing the first Logic Program language followed by the Scientific Community Model (with William Kornfeld), and for his work on Comparative Schematology (with Mike Paterson).\n\nHewitt is currently Board Chair of the International Society for Inconsistency Robustness (iRobust™)  and also Board Chair of Standard IoT™, an international standards organization for the Internet of Things, which is using the Actor Model to unify and generalize emerging standards for IoT.\n\nMore on Carl Hewitt: https://codesync.global/speaker/carl-hewitt/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM SF 2020\nCode BEAM SF is powered by Code Sync.
