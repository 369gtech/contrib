description: "I'll introduce hardware communication as a how-­to-walkthrough from digital signals up to a practical application through a\nseries of code and signal demonstrations. This talk is aimed at web developers seeking to learn more about how to connect\nmiscellaneous sensors to microcontrollers. No hardware experience is required.\n\nKelsey is an engineer and Steering Committee member of the Tessel Project —an open source organization whose aim is to\nempower web developers to enter the connected­devices space. Previously, Kelsey has been involved in developing consumer\ndrones, research on sleep and temperature, implantable vision devices, and devices for lung cancer diagnosis. She has a degree in neural engineering, and is interested in prosthetics, speculative fiction, circus arts, and really long walks.\n\n\nJSConf.Asia - Capitol Theatre, Singapore - 26 November 2016.\n\nSource: https://2016.jsconf.asia/\nSlides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sNKGyS73GbgQopQ9OrLhWA0snM1pNYLHfPHxWKwWY7s/edit?usp=sharing\nDemos: https://github.com/Frijol/Singapore_demos\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
