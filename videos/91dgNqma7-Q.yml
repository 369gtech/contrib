description: "The Magic of Kubernetes Self-Healing Capabilities - Saad Ali, Google \n\nKubernetes is used to manage large-scale clusters with hundreds or thousands of nodes. Components will inevitably fail at this scale, but human intervention to detect and correct these failures is unsustainable. This is where Kubernetes shines. With a declarative API and guarantees of eventual consistency, Kubernetes is able to continuously monitor the system and take actions to keep the cluster healthy.    This talk provides an architectural overview of the self-healing capabilities of Kubernetes. We will discuss how these capabilities are born from the declarative API, and how Kubernetes components work together to drive to the desired state. We will provide detailed examples from the volume subsystem which automatically makes storage available to containers. We will end by revealing edge cases that Kubernetes currently doesnâ€™t handle well, and explain the plans to address these issues. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPcA"
