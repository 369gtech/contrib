description: "Jenkins X: Continuous Delivery for Kubernetes - Carlos Sanchez, CloudBees \n\nJenkins X is a new open source CI/CD platform for Kubernetes based on Jenkins. Jenkins X runs on Kubernetes and transparently uses on demand containers to run build agents and jobs, and isolate job execution. It enables CI/CD-as-code using Jenkins Pipelines and automated deployments of commits and pull requests using Skaffold, Helm and other popular tools. We will demo how to use Jenkins X on any Kubernetes cluster for fully automated CI and CD using a GitOps approach. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/GrT2"
