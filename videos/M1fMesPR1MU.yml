description: "Speaker: Hong Khai Seng, Director @ Studio Dojo\n\nDesigners are seeing their wish come true: Design and design thinking now has widespread recognition, and we have increasingly more seats at the boardroom table.\n\nThis has also meant that more large-scale complex problems are given to designers to solve. In doing such work, new and frustrating situations may emerge where designers feel that their knowledge, tools and processes are no longer enough to achieve the best outcomes.\n\nThrough his exploration of other non-design disciplines, Khai Seng has gained new perspectives, and will bring in some frameworks to help designers become more effective change makers.\n\nAbout the speaker\n\nKhai Seng has been in the design field since 2004, focusing on design research and interaction design. He was previously the Head of Singapore for Foolproof, a UK-based experience design agency. He is a firm believer in holistic experience design spanning digital, spatial, product and service domains. However, he also thinks that delivering great design for a client is only part of the equation – it is also key to help clients bring sustained impact and cultural change in the way they work.\n\nThroughout his career, Khai Seng has facilitated many workshops and training programmes with C-suite executives and working professionals to drive cultural change within organizations around design and innovation. Khai Seng is also certified as an Integral coach by New Ventures West – that involves helping people to create and maintain habits of excellence that are self-generating and self-correcting.\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/khaiseng\n\nEvent Page: https://uxsea.org/summit-2019\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG"
