description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nState of the Art Supply Chain Security (in-toto, TUF, and SigStore) - Trishank Karthik Kuppusamy, Datadog; Asra Ali, Google & Santiago Torres-Arias, Purdue University\n\nIn this talk, we’ll explore the complementary roles that TUF, in-toto, and SigStore play in creating a transparent hack-proof software supply chain that thwarts man-in-the-middle attacks anywhere between developers and end-users. The talk will build off the basics of using in-toto and TUF together to deliver hack-proof updates, especially how it was done for the first time in the industry at Datadog, and then going the extra mile with SigStore. We’ll see how SigStore’s transparent and auditable model holds publishers accountable in this system. Finally, we’ll see a real example of the whole stack in action for the first time with Datadog’s integration, and show just how easy it is to adopt yourself!"
