Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe in Barcelona, May 20–23 (https://bit.ly/2B2vhMl), in Shanghai, June 24–26 (https://bit.ly/2JZcBjs), or in San Diego November 18–21 (https://bit.ly/2K031wW) in 2019. \n\nLet Developers and Operators Focus on What They Know Best - Rafal Gajdulewicz & Julie Zhuying Li, Google \n\nKubernetes has steep learning curve for application developers and operators to learn new concepts to manage multiple tools and artifacts to build deployment pipelines. This problem is worsened by the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of cloud and hybrid environments, where components constantly get upgraded, scaled and destroyed.   In this talk we would like to demonstrate a workflow letting each role focus on what they do best by separating app and ops artifacts and versioning them in separate repositories. This separation allows CI/CD tools to effectively keep the desired and actual state in sync while simplifying complex processes required when delivering multiple applications. Finally, we will show how the OSS Cluster Registry can be used to manage deployment and experimentation when managing multiple Kubernetes clusters in different environments. \n\nTo learn more click here:  https://sched.co/FuJY"
