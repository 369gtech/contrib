description: "You are exposing yourself every day online. You probably don't know how naked you are and how much sensitive information you display. Learn about the many ways you show yourself to others, what naughty bits they learn about you and what you can do to cover sensitive places. Learn who is straining to peek at you and how those peeping toms profit from your private information.\n\nWorse yet, you are also exposing your family and your business to the harsh light of day.\n\nTheresa Payton, online security consultant and former Chief Information Officer at the White House, and Ted Claypoole, privacy lawyer and co-chair of the American Bar Association's Cyberspace Privacy Subcommittee walk you through the internet's house of mirrors, exposing your vulnerable spots and unwrapping the best strategies for online privacy."
