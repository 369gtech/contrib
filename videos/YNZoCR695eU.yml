description: "ASP.NET Core is an open source and cross-platform web framework that runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux. It's lightweight and fast, and works great in containers.\nIn this session we'll learn about ASP.NET Core's speed and flexibility for making web apps, web apis, and javascrpt-heavy single page applications. We'll see how ASP.NET Core lights up when deployed to Microsoft Azure with logging and Application Insights, dependency tracking and timing information. We'll also explore the ways you can deploy ASP.NET Core using Git to Azure App Service, Docker and containers, or CI/CD from GitHub or VSTS.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcsydney.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
