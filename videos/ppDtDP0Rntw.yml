title: 'AWS, meet Clojure - David Chelimsky'

description: 'AWS SDKs hide data-driven services behind language-specific OO interfaces. Absent an official Clojure SDK, Clojure developers lean primarily on the Java SDK either directly or through wrapper libs, or a handful of pure Clojure options that only cover a small subset of AWS services. In this talk, David will introduce a direct, idiomatic, data-oriented Clojure library for invoking AWS APIs.'
