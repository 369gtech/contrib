description: 'Infrastructure automation is not what most developers prefer to do, but when they do, they seek for simplicity. Sshoogr started as a simple SSH wrapper, but currently it is growing to become Ansible of Groovy. That allows to combine configuration, connectivity and state management of your servers and containers within a simple and readable DSL.'
