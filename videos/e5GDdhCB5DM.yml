description: 'With the growth of even bigger Javascript applications there are appearing new roles to be played for the developers. In years of experience I have notice that, in most of the companies they have problems with their automated processes and data treatment. ETL and BI operations with the applications data, scheduling a mailing campaign, etc. Sometimes these processes affects to the business of the company and in a 90% of the cases they are bad implemented. Will have a look to the different existing tools to help developer to automatize processes.'
