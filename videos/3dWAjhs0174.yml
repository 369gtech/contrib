description: "Open source projects that are controlled by a single company are at a greater risk of changes that are not aligned with community interests, whereas projects that are under neutral foundations have a lower risk both for end users and software vendors. With advantages that include community building, innovation, and wider adoption, we should consider contributing more of our open source projects to neutral foundations.\n\nThis talk will cover:\n\n    Challenges of giving up control and why it might be worth it.\n    Selecting a foundation and how to determine neutrality.\n    Creating a fair and neutral governance structure and processes for your project.\n    Tips for contributing and maintaining your project.\n\nThe audience will get practical advice about whether they should contribute their projects to neutral foundations along with how and when to do it.\n\n\n\n###########\n\nFollow us on Social Media and join the Community!\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Fossbckstg​\n\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/groups/86530...​\n\nFOSS Backstage is an event by Plain Schwarz – https://plainschwarz.com"
