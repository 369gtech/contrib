description: 'Continuous delivery makes it possible to develop and deploy software within hours instead of months or weeks or days. But what about testing? Testing is not fast. Which means you will have to cut corners, but add additional measures to compensate. Many companies market their continuous delivery practices, so others can see how cool they are, but also learn from their experiences. In this talk I will go through some highlights and things that work well and not so well in these example continuous delivery implementations, and then will concentrate on testing patterns, approaches and little hints that I have learnt both from these examples and from my own experience.'
