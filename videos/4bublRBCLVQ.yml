description: "Andrei Chirila, Google\n\nDid you ever wonder how testing at Google looks like? What tools we use to help us out and how do we measure and act on test coverage? We will briefly describe the development process at Google, then focus on use of code coverage measurement and how we use code coverage to improve code quality and engineering productivity. In the end, we'll present the vast amount of coverage data, spanning more than 100.000 commits, we have collected and some more widely applicable conclusions we have reached."
