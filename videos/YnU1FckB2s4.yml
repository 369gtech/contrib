Each week, .NET experts will be walking through Learn modules and answering your questions live. From front-end development with Razor Pages and Blazor to backend development with APIs, Static Apps, and microservices, youâ€™ll be guided by easy to digest conceptual content and hands-on exercises.\r\n\r\nASP.NET Core supports creating webpages using a native templating engine called Razor. In this module, you'll learn how to create web pages using Razor with ASP.NET Core. In this episode, you will:\r\n\r\nUnderstand when and why to use Razor Pages for your ASP.NET Core app.\r\nUse the .NET Core CLI to create a new page in the app.\r\nCreate a form that supports the app's product data management requirements.\r\nAdd client-side form input validation using Razor's Input Tag Helper.\r\nAdd server-side model validation using data annotations.\r\nRun and test the web app."
