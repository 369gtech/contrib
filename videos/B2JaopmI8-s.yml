recordingDate: 1535616424
description: "With the sky-rocketing prices of cryptocurrencies, everyone are jumping on the crypto-mining wagon to make good money!\nIn December 2017, we set out to build a custom mining rig that mines for Ethereum. In this talk, we will share about our experiences in building a rig, overclocking the system to improve performance and quickly get back your Return on Investment (ROI) and why you should build your own mining rig. We will show you how to install and configure the mining software on your mining rig too.\n\nSo after youâ€™ve learnt how to make your first crypto-dollar from a mining rig, where do you store them? We will discuss on the various types of crypto wallets and weigh in on the pros and cons. We will then show you how to use them to store your cryptocurrencies, and importantly, how to protect them.\n\nThis talk is aimed at individuals who are new to cryptocurrencies and are keen to get started in making their first million in cryptocurrency!"
