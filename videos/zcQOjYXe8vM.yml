title: 'GOOS style TDD by Example - Sagy Rozman'
recordingDate: 1468750467
description: "This is a live demonstration of outside-in TDD starting from an end to end test (walking skeleton) and driving the finer implementation details using unit tests.\nThe purpose is to demonstrate how e2e tests can drive your architectural decisions and the need for unit tests can drive your internal design.\nWe'll start with a simple http server and complicate things as we go to show how changes in the requirements affect our architecture and design decisions.\n\nAbout Sagy: \nSagy has been studying applying and teaching TDD and agile practices for more than a decade now. He is currently employed as a technical coach at Wix.com. \nHe's also a musician and loves everything to do with music and improvisation."
