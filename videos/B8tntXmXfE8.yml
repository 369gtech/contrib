description: "This talk covers the architecture and challenges of moving user-facing applications from startup mode to enterprise mode.\n\nThe problem of 88 different applications that use every JS framework, 600+ API endpoints, multiple JavaScript dialects, with an unproductive UX or UI components.\n\nWe will cover architecture to facilitate the migration of disparate applications to a large scale Single Page web application and the environment that supports it. Also, we will discuss the challenges of introducing new technologies, like React, GraphQL and Node.js, to an entrenched development organisation with strong opinions (smile)."
