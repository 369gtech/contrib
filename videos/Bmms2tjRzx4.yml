Patrick will talk about what's new in Docker 17.09, which should have shipped by Devoxx BE, a recap of DockerCon EU announcements, and an update on the Open Container Initiative standards and the Moby project, the upstream project from which Docker is built, including projects like LinuxKit, InfraKit and containerd.\n\nThe talk will include demos of how Docker can help developers build, ship and run microservice based applications, and modernise traditional applications, and how systems builders can assemble specialized container based systems with Moby and its library of components.\n\n# Patrick Chanezon\nPatrick Chanezon is member of technical staff at Docker Inc.
