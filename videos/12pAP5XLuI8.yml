description: "So, you know how to start developing a mixed reality experience, but want to take it further and master more of the details that make it more immersive, more natural, more believable? This talk will introduce new concepts and build on existing ones for doing just that.\n\nLearn how to take advantage of advanced gestures such as hold and manipulate, how to expand on voice commands, learn to master the developer tools such as the emulator and perception simulation, and much more. Get to grips with the development cycle and get into the details of the HoloLens development experience.\n\nAt the end of this talk you will have the tools and knowledge to build more immersive and natural holographic experiences that take full advantage of mixed reality and isnâ€™t merely an augmented or virtual experience."
