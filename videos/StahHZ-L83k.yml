Unfortunately, as your project grows larger and more complex, its build will become slower if left unchecked. You’ve updated to the latest Android Plugin, but you’re still waiting more than you like, what can you do? Recent Gradle releases give you new capabilities to greatly improve your build speed. This session discusses how you can :\n\nIdentify performance bottlenecks with build scans\nFix common problems, like slow configuration time, tasks running when they shouldn’t, and builds that don’t parallelize well\nBenefit from incremental annotation processing\n\nCédric Champeau \nFrom Gradle, Inc\nCédric Champeau is a software engineer at Gradle, Inc. , where he is currently focused on implementing next generation dependency management features. He also worked on improving the performance of the build tool. He is committer of Apache Groovy and spent more than 3 years developing full time the language at Pivotal, where he implemented features like the static compiler, traits, Android support, AST transformations or type checking extensions.\n\nPrior to that, he spent several years in the industry as a user, where he used Groovy in multiple industrial contexts including DSLs for natural language processing, scripting or even workflows."
