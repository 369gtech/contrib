description: "Containers are the past, orchestration of containers is the future. In this talk you are going to learn the basic definitions that you will find in a Kubernetes cluster and how to deploy your applications there.\n\nYou are going to move your app from running it in a simple container to do a rolling-update in several machines and with 0 downtime.\n\nDon't be scared, there will be loads of examples that will help to understand the abstractions that people from Kubernetes came up with."
