recordingDate: 1486917773
description: "Software development has evolved. Agile is now the de-facto standard. The role of an architect in an agile project is very different than the typical role in a more classic waterfall approach. Using an updated interpretation of ‘viewpoints and perspectives’, this talk will demonstrate how to make rapid, agile delivery sustainable. These viewpoints and perspectives will be linked to easy-to-produce models that can be used immediately in your projects. The talk will provide examples on how to determine which models are architecturally significant and worth the effort.\n\nDevelopers have always been very important stakeholders of an architectural description. A good agile architect needs to strive for consensus and buy-in."
