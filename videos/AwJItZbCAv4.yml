title: 'Asynchronous Event Handling Using Microservices and Kafka'
language: English
recordingDate: 1627332541
description: "Anytime you have a dependency on a third-party tool/application, one of the most common questions an engineer asks themselves is how can I integrate with this tool/application from my local development environment. Being able to integrate with these things locally reduces the feedback loop making development easier and more cost effective. In this session, Brian Mericle shows a few different ways to get Kafka up and running on your local machine and will also show how to interact with Kafka from the command-line.\n\nCheck out Brian Mericle's liveProject:\n\nðŸ“¼  ðŸ“¼  ðŸ“¼  ðŸ“¼ \nAsynchronous Event Handling Using Microservices and Kafka | http://mng.bz/aKBo \nTo save 40% off this liveProject use discount code: twitmeri40\n ðŸ“¼  ðŸ“¼  ðŸ“¼\n\nAbout this liveProject:\nIn this liveProject, youâ€™ll use the Kafka distributed streaming data platform to help convert a legacy order fulfillment system to a sleek new asynchronous event-driven architecture. This architecture needs to deliver services that can scale and evolve independently, to speed up your clients eCommerce app. Youâ€™ll use the Go language to build a microservice, an event publisher, and multiple event consumers; and work with Kafkaâ€™s command-line tools to create, alter, and test topics."
