description: "RubyConfBY 2019 - https://rubyconference.by\n\nVideo Partner â€“ iTechArt  https://www.itechart.by \n\nAbout the talk: \nOn our way to scalability in SoftSwiss we discovered that our beloved RabbitMQ does not want to play by new rules. So we turn our heads towards ApacheKafka, stream-processing platform developed to withhold hundreds of thousands messages per second. \n\nIn this talk I'll briefly discuss Kafka's architecture, show how we spin it up in production (and which problems we encountered) and talk about future challenges our product have to solve to fully encorporate high-availability mindset."
