description: "It's very easy to become hierarchical and turn into a \"bank\" when software company is growing fast. Is there a way to avoid that? How to keep the focus on value creation? What about Value departments, not Functional departments?\n\nWant to share ideas what we can learn from Scrum and apply in organisational design. Will share hypothesis how company could look like when everybody is focused on value creation."
