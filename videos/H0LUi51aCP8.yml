Over these years we've adopted microservices architectures to ever growing set of use-cases and different development and deployment strategies. Lessons were learned and our ability to design, develop, deploy and operate microservices has improved.\nThis presentation will give an opinionated view of how microservices evolved in the last few years, based on experience gained while working with companies using Apache Kafka to update their application architecture. We'll discuss the rise of API gateways, service mesh, state management and serverless architectures - what works well, and in which cases. We'll show real-world examples of how applications become more resilient and scalable when new patterns are introduced, and make sure to include caveats - because patterns [...]\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotochgo.com/2020/sessions/1370/beyond-microservices-streams-state-and-scalability\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOchgo\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#Microservices #Programming #APIs #APIgateways #ApacheKafka #ServiceMesh #Serverless\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
