description: "Slides: https://quirksmode.org/presentations/Spring2015/chromia_mobilism.pdf\n\nWhere web developers expect Chrome to offer a single platform for web sites and web apps, and that all Android 4.3+ users use Chrome as their default browser, reality is diverging at a fast clip. Google Chrome has never been the default browser on any system, except for Google's own Nexus and the Motorolas that were created while Google owned the company. Most important Android vendors, such as Samsung, HTC, and LG, are now using their own Chromium-based browsers as defaults. So far PPK identified eleven of them, and they're all subtly different.\n\nWhat's going on? Why does everyone want its own Chromium? Why doesn't Google step in and force Google Chrome on everybody? And what's the deal with that other Android default browser, Android WebKit?\n\nIn this presentation PPK explains.\n\nAbout ppk: https://quirksmode.org\nAbout Mobilism: https://mobilism.nl/\n\nVideography generously sponsored by BÃ©yonit: https://www.beyonit.nl/"
