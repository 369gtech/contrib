title: 'Can explanations be trusted? - Pan Kessel - PyData Berlin August 2020'

recordingDate: 1598423482
description: "Abstract: Explanation methods in Machine Learning are on the rise. This is unsurprising as they promise to provide a tool to make blackbox algorithms transparent. This, in turn, can lead to increased trust and reliability. Furthermore, explanation methods are very simple to deploy as they are now integrated in standard deep learning libraries.\n\nIn this talk, I will however demonstrate that explanations have to be considered with care. This is because they can be easily manipulated to closely reproduce an almost arbitrary target explanation. The underlying mechanisms for this surprising degree of manipulablity can be theoretically understood using the mathematics of the General Theory of Relativity, i.e. Differential Geometry.\n\nReference:\nhttps://papers.nips.cc/paper/9511-explanations-can-be-manipulated-and-geometry-is-to-blame\nhttps://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/3760-Paper.pdf\n\nBio: Pan Kessel is a member of the machine learning group at Technische Universit√§t Berlin. He received his PhD in String Theory at the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics. His main research interests currently are theoretically grounded explainable AI, generative models and their application to quantum physics, and the theory of learning.\n\n\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
