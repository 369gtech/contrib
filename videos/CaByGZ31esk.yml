We mishear each other, ask for clarification, stumble over words, and sometimes start over. These imperfections are not unusual. They're a natural part of dialogue. Because of these challenges, conversational technologies need to go beyond simple 'error handling' and embrace the rocky paths to task completion. This talk will discuss the challenges inherent in conversational interfaces and review graceful, humane ways to circumvent them, both from a design and research perspective. - Captured Live on Ustream at https://www.ustream.tv/amuse"
