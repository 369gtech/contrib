title: 'Image Optimization. The “how to” by Jon Sneyers'
language: English
recordingDate: 1495024138
description: "Images are a crucial part of any website or app. In this talk we'll give a brief history of image formats for the web, discussing both the universally supported GIF, JPEG, and PNG formats and some of the newer formats: WebP, JPEG XR, JPEG 2000, BPG and FLIF. We also briefly look at vector formats, in particular SVG and icon fonts. We will cover the strengths and weaknesses of each format and how to use them effectively.\n\nSelecting the right format and compression quality settings for an image is not a trivial task. It has become even more challenging when progressive and responsive web design are thrown into the mix, as well as user-uploaded images. Optimizing your images is important though, since on average, about two thirds of website bandwidth goes to images. We will give you some pointers on how to do this manually, and more importantly, how to automate the process.\n\nJon Sneyers is a member of Cloudinary’s R&D team, and works on its image processing backend. Cloudinary is a cloud-based image management solution that manages 15 billion images; its backend processes thousands of images per second. It is used by over 100,000 web developers. Jon is an expert in image formats for the web. He created the Free Lossless Image Format (FLIF), which achieves better lossless compression than any other format.\n\nJon has a PhD in computer science from the University of Leuven (Belgium) and he currently lives in Brussels."
