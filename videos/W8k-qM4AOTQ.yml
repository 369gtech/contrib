Nowadays WebRTC is everywhere, in your phone, your apps, your fridge. Facebook is using it at the core of Messenger and claims a whooping 17 billion calls, for example. More and more complex apps, with programmatic APIs, AI, … are augmenting the original tech for truly amazing products. Now that WebRTC Next Version is being worked on, it’s a good time to position the start-up ecosystem to be ready for the next disruptive wave.\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/NUSHackers/events/258489670/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/nfTv/"
