description: "Speaker: Ben Chad, Senior Technical Account Manager, Acquia\n\nDrupal 8 is capable of powering sites that are viewed at blistering speed by millions of users. Performance at this level, however, doesn’t come by accident, and developers have a key role to play in ensuring that Drupal can scale to these heights. All it takes is one poor decision, and your site can slow to a crawl for everyone.\n\nIn this talk, I’ll share my recent experience with preparing Drupal to drive content for the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games, one of the world’s largest international multi-sport events. At event time, we served 3.9b requests to 8.4m unique visitors over 11 days with no downtime or critical incidents. It was an unqualified success.\n\nIn my role as a Technical Account Manager at Acquia, I’m responsible for steering my customers to success with Drupal and Acquia products. I’m passionate about working with DevOps Engineers, and helping them understand the role they have to play in large scale Drupal.\n\nAbout the Speaker:\n\nBen is an experienced software consultant with a demonstrated history of generating customer value in PaaS and SaaS environments. He focusses on Customer Success, and fosters development of technical partnerships where he can provide thought leadership and advocacy. He has a strong engineering background, and is skilled in several mainstream programming languages. He is formerly a Mathematics Lecturer, and has a DPhil from University of Oxford.\n\nEvent Page: https://www.drupalcamp.sg/\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\nRecorded by: Michael Cheng"
