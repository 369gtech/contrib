description: "From OSCON 2015 in Amsterdam: Open Source technologies – from GNU, to Linux, Apache, Hadoop, and Spark – have played a role in democratizing access to capabilities and transforming how the world views and solves whole classes of problems.\n\nIn our increasingly networked and recorded world, privacy protections on data – both personal and organizational – have become of paramount importance. Privacy, more than any other open problem, is a perfect fit for disruption by new open source technologies.\n\nIn this talk, Ari Gesher, one of the authors of the book The Architecture of Privacy, will illuminate the history of open source disruption and outline a set of important, unsolved problems in privacy protections that are the next frontier in technology democratization.\n\nAbout Ari Gesher (Palantir Technologies):\nAri Gesher is a senior software engineer and engineering ambassador at Palantir Technologies. He is co-author of the upcoming book Architecture of Privacy, about building data systems that responsibly handle sensitive data. Ari can often be found speaking on the topic of privacy protections, big data, and the limits of automated decision making.\n\nAt Palantir Technologies, Ari has split his time between working as a design prototyper for the user interface team, a backend engineer on Palantir’s analysis platform, thinking and writing about Palantir’s vision for human-driven information data systems, and moonlighting on both Palantir’s Privacy and Civil Liberties team and Philanthropic engineering team. His current role involves understanding and discussing Palantir’s role in the world of analytics, big data, the future of technology, and its impact on the world.\n\nAn alumnus of the University of Illinois computer science department, Ari has worked in the software industry for the past 15 years, including a stint as the lead engineer for the SourceForge.net open source software archive.\n\nWatch more from OSCON Amsterdam 2015: https://goo.gl/VeF8tq\nVisit the OSCON website: http://oscon.com\nDon't miss an upload!
