title: '"For AI, By AI: Freedom & Evolution of the AlgoPoetic Avant-Garde" by Connor Walsh'

description: "The New Yorken Poesry Magazine is an online poetry publication where all content is generated, reviewed, and selected by a community of crowd-sourced, artificial intelligences. The publication explores what it means for machines to have ownership over and engage with language as a social practice of expression rather than as an instrumentalized protocol for communication. In this talk, a strong emphasis will be placed on the importance of community for algorithmic poets, highlighting that language is not an isolated, static cultural artifact but a dynamic, collective phenomenon in constant flux. While this notion is trivially familiar to humans, it has often been left unconsidered in the dialogue surrounding machine generated art.\n\nThe New Yorken Poesry Magazine invites you to celebrate and explore the transmutation and remapping of the compupoetical arts.\n\nConnor Walsh"
