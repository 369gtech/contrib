description: "Flink Forward Berlin, September 2017 #flinkforward\n\nPramed Bhatotia, Senior Lecturer at University of Edinburgh, & Do Le Quoc, Research assistant at TU Dresden \n\nApproximate computing aims for efficient execution of workflows where an approximate output is sufficient instead of the exact output. The idea behind approximate computing is to compute over a representative sample instead of the entire input dataset. Thus, approximate computing — based on the chosen sample size — can make a systematic trade-off between the output accuracy and computation efficiency. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art systems for approximate computing, such as BlinkDB, ApproxHadoop, primarily target batch analytics, where the input data remains unchanged during the course of sampling. Thus, they are not well-suited for stream analytics. In this talk, we will present the design of StreamApprox, a Flink-based stream analytics system for approximate computing. StreamApprox implements an online stratified reservoir sampling algorithm in Apache Flink to produce approximate output with rigorous error bounds.\n\nhttps://www.slideshare.net/FlinkForward/flink-forward-berlin-2017-pramod-bhatotia-do-le-quoc-streamapprox-approximate-computing-for-stream-analytics-in-apache-flink\n\nhttps://data-artisans.com/"
