description: 'Writing code is cool, but see it generating automatically is even cooler! This talk will be a case study about possibilities of Annotation Preprocessing in Java development. Let''s look into popular libraries and frameworks that are using Annotation Preprocessing (like Lombok, Dagger 2, Retrofit, MapStruct), talk about it pros and cons compared with Reflection / Runtime Code Generation and discuss how you can create your own library that will generate boilerplate code at compile time.'
