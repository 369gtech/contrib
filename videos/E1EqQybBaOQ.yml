description: "Matthew Treinish\nhttp://linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/158/\nThe OpenStack Gate operates at a tremendous scale, with on average roughly 12 thousand test jobs launched every day. It's exciting to see testing happen at such a large scale. However there is an issue, it is too difficult for humans to deal with all the data being generated or analyze all the results from the testing. To deal with this the OpenStack community has developed and deployed several tools to help deal with the torrent of data. Using and building off these tools have been invaluable especially as the OpenStack project continues to grow. This talk will explain the basics of OpenStack's CI infra and cover the approach and tooling used by the OpenStack community to interact with the large amount of test result. It will explain the techniques used and the benefits derived from having both open test result data and performing analysis on that data to understand the project."
