language: English

description: "Java developers are often exposed to the inner-workings of JVM's garbage collectors, and there are a host of tools that help monitor garbage collector activity.\n\nBut less often seen are the inner machinations of just-in-time compilation and deoptimization -- and how those machinations impact application performance.\n\nIn this talk, we'll learn how to read some of the JVMs mysterious log files, explore tools for visualizing the information, and most importantly correlate the JVM activity with application performance behavior."
