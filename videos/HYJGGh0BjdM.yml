description: "Many developers consider the deployment platform to be a black box that the JVM abstracts away. In reality, this is not the case. The characteristics of the hardware do have a measurable impact on the performance of any Java application. In this session, two Java Rock Star presenters explore how hardware features influence the performance of your application. You will not only learn how to measure this impact but also find out how to improve the performance of your applications by writing hardware-friendly code.\n\n\nAuthors:\nCharlie Hunt\nundefined\nView more trainings by Charlie Hunt at https://www.parleys.com/author/charlie-hunt\n\nDarryl Gove\nDarryl Gove is a senior principal software engineer in the Solaris Studio team, working on optimising applications and benchmarks for current and future processors.
