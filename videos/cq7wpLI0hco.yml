description: "Google TechTalks\nMay 16, 2006\n\nGregor Kiczales\nGregor Kiczales is Professor of Computer Science at the University of British Columbia. His work is directed at enabling programmers to write programs that, as much as possible, look like their design. ABSTRACT\nAspect-oriented programming (AOP) is based on a radical exploration of modularity in software development. By presenting new mechanisms that enable better modularization in a number of systems, AOP is driving us to ask fundamental questions about what modularity should mean in our field. In the past, we have tended to think of modularity in terms of hierarchies of crisply defined blocks, where each block or module defines its interface with the..."
