description: "In this video, Dr G will use JavaScript, Azure, GitHub, and Visual Studio Code to write a web app that helps the Tune Squad coach make data-based decisions on the basketball court, inspired by \"Space Jam: A New Legacy\".\n\nExplore the new Learning Path\nhttps://aka.ms/ExploreSportsWithCode\n\nAbout \"Space Jam: A New Legacy\"\nWelcome to the Jam!  Basketball champion and global icon LeBron James goes on an epic adventure alongside timeless Tune Bugs Bunny with the animated/live-action event \"Space Jam: A New Legacy,\" from director Malcolm D. Lee and an innovative filmmaking team including Ryan Coogler and Maverick Carter.  This transformational journey is a manic mashup of two worlds that reveals just how far some parents will go to connect with their kids. When LeBron and his young son Dom are trapped in a digital space by a rogue A.I., LeBron must get them home safe by leading Bugs, Lola Bunny and the whole gang of notoriously undisciplined Looney Tunes to victory over the A.I.'s digitized champions on the court: a powered-up roster of basketball stars as you've never seen them before.  It's Tunes versus Goons in the highest-stakes challenge of his life, that will redefine LeBron's bond with his son and shine a light on the power of being yourself. The ready-for-action Tunes destroy convention, supercharge their unique talents and surprise even \"King\" James by playing the game their own way."
