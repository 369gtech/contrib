title: 'Learning and Teaching Clojure on the job at Amperity - Dave Fetterman'
language: English
recordingDate: 1543682392
description: 'Amperity uses Clojure for 99% of its implementation, but most of Amperity’s software engineers do not join the team with significant Clojure experience. Through Amperity’s structured three-month engineering onboarding, engineers get exposure to different subsystems but also different Clojure paradigms and tools. Amperity’s VP of engineering, a Clojure beginner himself not so long ago, describes the company’s Clojure onboarding process, materials, and approach for getting functionally curious engineers productive in our favorite language.'
