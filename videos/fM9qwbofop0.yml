description: "Talk recording from Amsterdam JSNation Conference 2019 https://jsnation.com\n\n# RabbitMQ and PM2 in Node.js for managing Multiple Processes\n\nAs Node.js is single threaded. This is why you can’t take full advantage of multiple core machines unless you use the cluster module or a process manager like PM2.\n\nWe moved our application from the cluster module to PM2 & RabbitMQ. This talk will cover the Why/What/How we made this migration."
