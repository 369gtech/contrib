language: English
recordingDate: 1637683088
description: "In this session, we’ll explore Java as it is in 2021. JDK 17 has just been released, the ninth (yes, ninth) release in four years. As a long-term support (LTS) release, this is one that many users will choose to use in production. We’ll review the significant new features developers will now be able to exploit as they develop their next applications.\n\nWe’ve also seen a proliferation in the number of distributions of OpenJDK. We’ll talk about the factors to consider when choosing distribution and how to ensure you keep your Java runtimes as stable and secure as possible.\n\nWe’ll finish with a look at how Java fits in the cloud and some of the performance issues to consider when moving to a microservices architecture. We’ll explain how you can lower your cloud infrastructure costs and reduce latency without changing a line of code.\n\nSimon Ritter - is the Deputy CTO of Azul Systems. Simon has been in the IT business since 1984 and holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Physics from Brunel University in the U.K.  Simon joined Sun Microsystems in 1996 and started working with Java technology from JDK 1.0; he has spent time working in both Java development and consultancy. Having moved to Oracle as part of the Sun acquisition, he managed the Java Evangelism team for the core Java platform. Now at Azul, he continues to help people understand Java as well as Azul’s JVM technologies and products. Simon has twice been awarded Java Rockstar status at JavaOne and is a Java Champion. He currently represents Azul on the Java SE Expert Group.\n___________________________\nFoo Café is a meeting place for people with an interest in software development and IT. \nHere, user groups and partner companies find the perfect atmosphere for sharing knowledge and develop competence. \nFoo Café is open for everyone and is free to attend.
