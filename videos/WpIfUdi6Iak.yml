Just email us at neverbeen@fitc.ca for a VERY special offer!\n\n“Every now and then I fall apart” – Bonnie Tyler may not have been singing about love after all. Explore the parallels between her epic love anthem and the creative process to uncover the conditions needed to create, evolve, and sell through creative ideas.\n\nSteve Martell, VP Creative Technology at Current Studios, finds humour and inspiration in the joy and tragedy of the creative process. This presentation exposes the constant insecurities and fear of those who create, the reckless belief that great work needs only one great mind, and the human stories that are often hidden when showcasing superhuman creative work.\n\nStephen Martell\nVP, Creative Technology, Current Studios\nhttp://www.twitter.com/stevemartell\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
