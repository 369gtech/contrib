description: "??ATTENTION ??\nRegistration to ?DevTernity 2018 is running:\n? https://devternity.com\n\nBuilding distributed applications on commodity hardware in the cloud allows to scale almost infinitely but for the price that everything can fail all the time. This talk introduces patterns like circuit-breakers, bulkheads and others to build robust software architectures that embrace failures. Additional techniques like failure-injection testing are introduced to move robust architecture to self-healing and anti-fragile architectures."
