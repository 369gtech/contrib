description: "Google I/O 2010 - Go Programming \r\n\r\nTech Talks \r\n\r\nRob Pike, Russ Cox \r\n\r\nThe Go Programming Language was released as an open source project in late 2009. This session will illustrate how programming in Go differs from other languages through a set of examples demonstrating features particular to Go.  These include concurrency, embedded types, methods on any type, and program construction using interfaces. Very little time will be spent waiting for compilation. \r\n\r\nFor all I/O 2010 sessions, please go to http://code.google.com/events/io/2010/sessions.html"
