But don't let it! Speaking at conferences, meetups, or even at your own company is a fantastic way to share you knowledge, meet others, advance your career, and give back. Whether you are on the fence, have decided to take the plunge and submit a CFP, or have already even a few talks, this session is for you. Jenny Burcio and Ashlynn Polini will outline tips and strategies for turning your idea into a winning proposal and ultimately a compelling talk. Drawing on their experience reviewing DockerCon CFPs and prepping speakers (including themselves) for a variety of conferences, they will share how to submit and prepare for your first - or next - conference talk. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UaYJ"
