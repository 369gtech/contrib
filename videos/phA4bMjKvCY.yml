description: 'The success of deep learning has again raised the hope for artificial intelligence (AI). As the understanding of the strengths of deep learning deepens, a desire to combine it with other approach emerges. Clojureâ€™s data oriented programming is shown to offer a perfect bridge between symbolic and data driven AI. In this talk, we introduce REP, a domain specific language embedded in Clojure that provides the quickest path to authoring a chat bot. We show how Clojure enables us to combine the strength of symbolic and data driven approach of machine learning to build an AI platform that is easy to use, even for non-programmers.'
