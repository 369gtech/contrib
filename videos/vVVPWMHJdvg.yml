recordingDate: 1400783345
description: "Chef is an incredibly feature-rich and powerful tool, designed to provide a framework for users of any of the major Operating Systems to automate anything they want. Simply put, Chef is a generic platform which provides a number of built in tools, resources and services to facilitate this automation.\n\nI'm going to take you on a whistlestop tour through the internals of Chef, exploring how everything fits together and the various places you can hook in custom code. I'm particularly going to focus on helping you decide when it's appropriate to use each customization type and also whether or not you should customize - it would be a fallacy for me to tell you that just because you can customize something, you automatically should. As someone once said, 'with great power comes great responsibility'."
