title: 'A Pragmatist’s Guide to Functional Geekery by Michał Płachta'
language: English
recordingDate: 1495024862
description: "Basic functional concepts like immutable data, second-order functions, lambdas and function composition can already be found in the modern programmer’s toolkit.\n\nDuring this talk you will learn about more advanced functional concepts and how they can solve real problems. I will talk about pattern matching, algebraic data types, type classes, functional abstractions and folding.\n\nI will show you a practical example written using today’s Java functional constructs and build up from there. I will use only JVM-based languages to show you how they can improve the code, make it more maintainable and safe.\n\nMichał Płachta \nPolyglot software engineer specialised in developing distributed applications. Functional programming enthusiast. Loves the human component in software projects. Drinks a lot of tea. Has a blog at michalplachta.com. He currently works as team leader at Ocado Technology, where he is building actor-based software for automated warehouse."
