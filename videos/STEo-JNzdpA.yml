description: "Speaker: David Delabassee\r\n\r\n== David\r\nDavid works on Developer Relations at the Java Platform Group in Oracle. He has been in Sun/Oracle for the past 19 years and would be able to tell you how it all happened.\r\nWe were honored to have David in Singapore one year ago and his talk was very well received (https://www.meetup.com/singajug/events/259788242/).\r\n\r\n== Java and the 40 versions\r\nWith JDK 14 released just a few weeks ago and JDK 15 already on the horizon, it is sometimes difficult to keep up with the Java release cadence and the new features added to it. This session proposes to discuss the enhancements recently added to the platform, large and small. We will also discuss long-term, read impactful, improvements such as Project Loom and Project Panama, and they will help you over time.\r\nAttend this (remote) session to discover what Java is bringing you in 2020.\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/singajug/events/270402937/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG"
