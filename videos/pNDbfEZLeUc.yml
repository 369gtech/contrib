description: "In order to change organization, leaders have to change first. Be one of them and turn your organization into the successful Agile organization. Organizations are constantly evolving, they change their structures, processes, and rules. Last decade they’ve been changing into Agile, and surprisingly despite all the effort and money they put into transformation, they’ve been often failing. The same way as culture follows an organization, the culture follows leaders. Companies were trying to break that rule for years and change the culture without changing leadership style. Nowadays this rule seems to win and organizations are moving towards different leadership styles and surprisingly becoming successful. In order to change organization, leaders have to change first. Be one of them and turn your organization into a successful Agile organization.\n\nLO:\n\nUnderstand the culture model, how the two halves of mindset and structure are wired together and what are the implication of that for the leader.\nLearn how the culture mirrors the leadership style.\nRaise awareness of Agile Leader competences and metaskills.\nAbout the speaker:  Zuzana “Zuzi” Šochová is an independent Agile coach and trainer and a Certified Scrum Trainer with more than fifteen years of experience in the IT industry.
