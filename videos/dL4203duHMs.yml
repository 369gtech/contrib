How often have you found that besides being good at your design job, you must also deal with development issues…AND reach an understanding with the business side of things? \n\nIf your answer to these questions is “Yes,” congratulations: you are NOT ALONE! \n\nDesign is the solution to a well-crafted problem defined through proper research. Research forms the foundation for any design decision, and so designers should spend as much time doing research—discovering problem areas, gaining insights, and identifying underlying user needs. Just as a stunning-looking skyscraper requires a physical foundation strong enough to support the building, an effective design requires a strong foundation of research. A poorly executed research phase is like building a skyscraper on bamboo stilts!\n\nThis session explores the importance of design research—the what, the why, and the how—and what it takes to design the right things first.\n\nAbout the speaker\n\nVictor is a visionary and thoughtful leader in user-centered innovation. With more than 15 years of experience in UX/UI design, he is passionate about transforming ideas into actualized, winning solutions—and about continually striving to provide top-tier, strategic design solutions.\n\nA design leader, storyteller, facilitator and collaborator, Victor works to take problems to solutions. To these ends, he is passionate about building and leading design teams, enabling them to achieve successful business outcomes by aligning with stakeholders, bringing user stories to life, and making sure we are designing the right thing first before we design things right.\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/victor-ong-06238725/\n\nEvent Page: https://uxsea.org/summit-2019\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/CZTsT/"
