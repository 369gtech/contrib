recordingDate: 1405634841
description: 'Reuse has been taught in CS classes since the very beginning. But how should you practically do to reuse functionality from one Grails application in other applications? The plugin subsystem in Grails is an awesome machinery that makes it easy to separate functionality into distinct plugins. Plugins that can be used in many applications with similar functionality. Yet have unique features without creating a maintenance hell.In this session you will learn how to think "feature plugins" when you''re designing and developing your Grails applications. We will cover topics like inter-plugin communication using application events and how to support different look and feel for each application using "theme plugins". You will also learn how each plugin can be tested and documented separately from the application.After this session "grails create-plugin" will be your best friend.'
