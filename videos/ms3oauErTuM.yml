description: "Need a quick and simple mechanism to collect, analyse and visualise data from your serverless apps, without running servers of course? In this case study, weâ€™ll explore one example of application simplification and cost optimisation by removing Elasticsearch and Kibana from an application architecture, replacing them with a scalable serverless alternative, reducing running costs for the app by more than 90% in the process. Based on AWS services, this talk will feature AWS Lambda, Kinesis, Glue, Athena & QuickSight.\n\nWebsite: https://cardiff.serverlessdays.io/"
