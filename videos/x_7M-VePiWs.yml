description: "Panel: Saving Lives - Accepting Donations at Scale Across Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes - Zenon Hannick, Armakuni, Caroline Rennie, Comic Relief, Shane Huston, Paula Kennedy & Debbie Wood, Pivotal\n\nEach year, Comic Relief raises tens of millions of pounds to fight poverty. A significant proportion of this is received online over the 7 hours of primetime television coverage. A few minutes of downtime during this period could mean missing out on millions of pounds to help those that need it most. In this session, speakers from Comic Relief, Pivotal and Armakuni share their experiences of building, scaling and running a mission-critical multi-region multi-foundation solution on Pivotal Cloud Foundry; with apps hosted on the Pivotal Application Service (PAS) and other production workloads running in Kubernetes clusters provisioned by the Pivotal Container Service (PKS).\n\nCome and hear from Comic Relief (customer), Armakuni (app developer and operator), Pivotal (platform operators and product operators), talk about the challenges and solutions faced in preparing for and supporting the 2018 Sport Relief event, (https://www.sportrelief.com/)\n\nhttps://cfseu18.sched.com/event/FRzA/panel-saving-lives-accepting-donations-at-scale-across-cloud-foundry-and-kubernetes-zenon-hannick-armakuni-caroline-rennie-comic-relief-shane-huston-paula-kennedy-debbie-wood-pivotal"
