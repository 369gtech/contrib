description: "Jonah Stiennon's lightning demo from the 2014 O'Reilly Velocity conference in Santa Clara, CA: \"Test Driven Mobile Development with Appium, Just Like Selenium\".\n\n\"In this Lightning Demo, I'll give a tour of Appium, an open source project which allows you to programmatically control mobile devices from the outside as if you were a user. Appium provides the same interface for iOS and Android, so one suite of tests can ensure that all versions of your app are reliableâ€”the same tests which run against a desktop website can be applied to browsers on both Android and iOS devices without requiring any code to be rewritten. Just like its web counterpart, Selenium, commands get sent to Appium as normalHTTP requests, allowing developers to write their tests in the language of their choice. I will show a phone controlled by Appium, how appium allows tests to be written for mobile sites, android, and iOS with the same interface written in any language, and then demo running a ton of tests in parallel in a hosted cloud.\"\n\nAbout Jonah Stiennon (Sauce Labs):\nJonah Stiennon is a software developer on the Ecosystems and Integrations team at Sauce Labs, and a contributor to Appium . As far as he knows, he is the only Node.js developer who was paid in Bitcoin and issued invoices as JSON documents.\n\nWatch more from the 2014 Velocity Conference: http://goo.gl/JoMfvo\nFind out more about Velocity: http://velocityconf.com/\n\nDon't miss an upload!
