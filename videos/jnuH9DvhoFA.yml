title: 'JDK IO  2016 - Michael Nitschinger - Reactive Data Access with RxJava ... and N1QL!'
recordingDate: 1474443309
description: 'This talk shows how to build scalable, reactive, and fault tolerant applications by making use of RxJava and the fully reactive Couchbase Java SDK. We will also cover stability patterns and how our SQL-ish query language, “N1QL” fits into the picture. This subject is important, as applications that exclusively rely on synchronous data access often hit a scalability wall when responses slow down and thread pools are exhausted. New paradigms, like reactive programming, alleviate the wasting of resources by dispatching them where they can do useful work and provide extensive toolsets to deal with the ever growing demands of web applications.'
