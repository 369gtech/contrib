description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nCortex: Intro and Production Tips - Bryan Boreham, Grafana Labs & Alvin Lin, Amazon Web Services\n\nCortex is a time-series data store based on Prometheus. Cortex adds: - Scalability: run across dozens of servers to handle millions of samples per second. - Availability: if one server fails then work will be redirected to others. - Multi-tenancy: store data from different groups or customers, segregated so a user from one tenant cannot see data from another. - Durability: use cloud stores (such as S3) to reduce the chance of data loss. This session will provide an overview of Cortex, an update on recent news from the project, and a run-through of top 5 tips for running Cortex in production."
