description: "It’s not news anymore that Microservices architecture is changing the way systems are designed and built, however what’s rarely discussed in detail is how the APIs exposed by those Microservices are managed and accessed from other systems or even other Microservices and more importantly how those APIs are discovered and consumed by a community of developers when building solutions. In this presentation Capgemini’s PaaS experts Phil and Luis will explain in detail how Microservices Architecture and API Management relate to each other. To do this reference architectures, capability models and architectural patterns will be described and then it will be shown -with practical examples, how to implement modern solutions in the Oracle Cloud.\n\nSpeaker: Luis Weir"
