description: "OWASP AppSec EU 2018 DevOps Track - Day 1, talk 1\n\nYou’ve probably heard many talks about DevSecOps and continuous security testing but how many provided the tools needed to actually start that testing?  This talk does exactly that.  It provides an overview of the open source AppSec Pipeline tool which has been used in real world companies to do real security work.  Beyond a stand alone tool, the OWASP AppSec Pipeline provides numerous docker containers ready to automate, a specification to customize with the ability to create your own implementation and references to get you started.\nThe talk will also cover how to add an AppSec Pipeline to your team’s arsenal and provide example templates of how best to run the automated tools provided.  Finally, we’ll briefly cover using OWASP Defect Dojo to store and curate the issues found by your AppSec Pipeline.  The goal of this talk is to share the field-tested methods of two AppSec professionals with nearly 20 years of experience between them.  If you want to start your DevSecOps journey by continuously testing rather then hear about it, this talk is for you.\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
