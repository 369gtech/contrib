description: "The Android framework offers a lot of flexibility when it comes to defining how to organize and architect an Android app. This freedom, whilst very valuable, can also result in apps with large classes, inconsistent naming and architectures (or lack of) that can make testing, maintaining and extending difficult. There are many different options, following different patterns and embracing different programming paradigms.\n\nAndroid Architecture Blueprints (https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture) is meant to demonstrate possible ways to help with these common problems. In this project we offer the same application implemented using different architectural concepts and tools. With more than 8000 stars in Github, numerous devs are using this sample to build upon for their own projects.\n\nThis talk will go though the motivations, findings and numbers extracted from these various approaches which will help choosing which one works best for you and your team.\n\nDavid González is an Android Software Engineer at Help Scout and a Google Developer Expert for Android (https://developers.google.com/experts/people/david-gonz-lez). He's actively involved in the Android community, co-organises the London Android User Group and has been developing with the Android platform since 2009.\n\nHe enjoys public speaking and loves sharing his experiences through conferences, blog posts and open source libraries. He is also Google Startup Launchpad mentor, helping startups and companies produce highly desirable and quality products, by following agile methodologies; a skilled development process; and always going the extra mile.\n\n[JLM-7245]"
