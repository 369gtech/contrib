description: "Infrastructure as Software - Paul Jones, Dyson \n\nInfrastructure as code has facilitated the automated provisioning of computing resources, however the cognitive overhead of adopting new DSLs, the verbosity of declaratively defining resources in templates, and the lack of basic programming language features can be inhibitors in development time and iteration. Pulumi is a Cloud Native Infrastructure as Code SDK for creating a deploying cloud applications in general purpose languages to AWS, Azure, GCP and Kubernetes. Similarly, the AWS CDK is an open-source framework for defining cloud infrastructure in modern programming languages, by building on the CDKâ€™s library of infrastructure constructs to compose stacks and apps. We will cover both Pulumi and the AWS CDK to explore the options to programmatically define infrastructure, as well as demonstrating their ability to facilitate more testable, extensible and secure infrastructure. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPXQ"
