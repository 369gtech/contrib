language: English
recordingDate: 1605265118
description: "Sarah Taraporewalla & Ann Mwangi\n\nEvent Driven Architecture is gaining popularity as teams look for ways to simplify the coordination of their microservices. With the growing popularity of Kakfa, and the success of other teams doing Event Driven Architecture, you decide that it is also right for you. However, there is a significant distance between understanding the concepts of Event Driven Architecture and getting your first event published in production. You will face quandaries like: How generic should you make an event? How should commands be treated? Is Kafka the only option? Or even, what to name your events? In this talk, Sarah will share some of the quandaries she faced when implementing her first Event Driven system in Azure with Event Hub. She will explore the implications of the different ways to address these, as well as the decision and reasoning behind the solution chosen. You will walk away from this talk with a refresher of the key concepts of Event Driven Architecture as well as insight into considerations you will need to make to get your first event published.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks at: \nhttps://ndcsydney.com\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/"
