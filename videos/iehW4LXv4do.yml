description: "Adam Farley, Programmer / Developer, IBM\nRenfei Wang, Software Developer, IBM\n\nOpen projects innovate. Developers at Eclipse OMR, Eclipse OpenJ9, and AdoptOpenJDK experience this firsthand every day. In test roles at these open projects, they must keep up with and often set the pace of change. They have gone through a rapid and occasionally tiring transformation in testing as they moved their projects and mission into the open. This session discusses their test transformation story, how they can quickly incorporate new tests, and the ongoing evolution of how they test languages. The speakers discuss some techniques for measuring success and strategies for collaboration with other teams that are developing new approaches to software verification."
