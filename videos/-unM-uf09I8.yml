title: 'Modern, Simple, Open. Pivotal CF and VMware'
recordingDate: 1409869500
description: "VMware kicked off VMworld 2014, its annual week-long showcase in San Francisco with a number of significant product and partnership announcements. \n\nAligned with Pivotal’s goal to empower enterprises to develop and deliver modern applications on an open cloud platform, VMware is pushing for a new model of IT that supports hybrid cloud platforms and drives agile, and mobile-first companies. \n\nDuring Pat Gelsinger’s keynote, the VMware CEO announced a partnership between Pivotal, VMware, Docker, and Google to integrate container technology into VMware’s virtualization offerings. The initiative will enable containers to isolate distributed applications on virtual machines, offering enterprises “containers without compromise,” in Gelsinger’s words. Pivotal will work with Docker and VMware to enhance the container project to include capabilities from Warden, a VMware-authored Linux container technology developed for Cloud Foundry.\n\nAt Forbes, Ben Kepes wrote “With these announcements the company has found a logical way to both support containerization but within the context of existing virtualized and vSphere environments.”\n\nPivotal CF and VMware’s products are built to work together to provide enterprises with the flexibility and choice, freeing them from the constraints of vendor lock-in and proprietary software. In conjunction with VMware’s virtualization products and services, Pivotal CF enables enterprises to deliver workloads where they see fit, choose who operates workloads and where, and distribute apps across multiple clouds based on availability and needs. \n\nVisit http://www.pivotal.io to learn more."
