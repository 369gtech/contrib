title: 'Will Machine Learning kill Business Logic? by Oliver Zeigermann'
recordingDate: 1550057996
description: "Business Logic has always been very tedious to write and maintain at best and feels random and ad-hoc ad worst. Often we express large and growing sets of rules using nested if statements or similar constructs. Both form and content are often questionable, though. Could it be there are better solutions?\n\nIn this talk we will discuss when Machine Learning might be the better option and which tools you would use. You will see actual code based on a real world example."
