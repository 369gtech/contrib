description: "Processing is getting cheaper, software is getting more distributed and clouds are taking over. These trends will have a significant impact on what we can do with test automation and what will make sense to automate in the future. Prohibitively expensive testing strategies are becoming relatively cheap, and things that we didnâ€™t even consider automating will become quite easy. At the same time, strategies that served us well for on-premise reliable hardware simply won't work for the distributed, fragmented, virtualised platforms.\nGojko presents emerging trends in the testing tools space and predicts how you'll be using tools differently ten years from now. If your organisation is suffering from the high cost of testing, come and learn about tools and trends that may help you outrun the competition."
