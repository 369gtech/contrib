description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nAdvanced Persistence Threats: The Future of Kubernetes Attacks - Ian Coldwater, Heroku & Brad Geesaman, Brad Geesaman Consulting \n\nWhat would happen if your cluster was successfully compromised by an attacker who understands Kubernetes at a deep level? How could they attempt to avoid detection, cover their tracks, achieve full cluster access, obtain persistence, steal credentials, and launch additional attacks in your environment? As Kubernetes grows in popularity, the sophistication of attackers will improve, and security by obscurity will no longer be sufficient. Cluster operators need to be aware of what a skilled and knowledgeable attacker can be capable of.  Let’s explore the dark corners of clusters and shine a light on how features such as ephemeral containers and validating webhooks can be used to maliciously mutate pods, exfiltrate data, deploy “shadow” control planes, and more. The audience will learn how to detect these advanced approaches and how to prevent these attacks using practical, proven methods.\n\nhttps://sched.co/ZesN"
