description: "Code is for Humans, Content for Machines \nby Frank Reding \n(@mottokrosh)\n\nWho reads our code? Our fellow developers do; and, often, ourselves many years hence (who might as well be a fellow developer.) So why do we strive so for brevity and terseness? Our compilers and interpreters don't care, after all. Who, then, reads our content, if not Facebook (to see if it's worthy of inclusion in someone's feed), or Google (to judge which ad complements it best), or Voiceover (to read it to a visually impaired user)? \n\nOur code is bloated with structure and meaning beyond the language that itself is an instruction set (cf. indentation, comments, programming patterns), whereas our content is an opaque mass of words, devoid of any such. Yet as our species' evolution is defined by sharing of knowledge, the very same knowledge, besides drowning in a morass of inane noise, does not lend itself easily to classification and comprehension by the machines we build to handle it.\n\nIn this talk, we'll have a closer look at the problem as presented, and examine practical ways in which we can add structure and semantics to the knowledge we immortalise on the internet. \n\nFrank is a senior front-end developer at Neontribe (they of the pulp prototyping fame), where he constantly seeks to eek out extra performance from web apps masquerading as native mobile apps. Unless he gets distracted by modern PHP frameworks, or new design tools."
