description: 'Grails 3 is a substantial and radical change in the Grails Ecosystem which requires some effort in order to migrate applications from Grails 2 to the newest version. This presentation explains which steps have to be taken and which gotchas exist in the migration process. Apart from the theory we will also migrate an existing application that is productive (http://www.allschools.de) and running with Grails 2 towards the newest version of Grails 3. This presentation will feature a few slides and tons of code.'
