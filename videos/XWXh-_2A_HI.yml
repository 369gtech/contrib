description: "Over the course of six years, the Cochlear System 7 project went from prototypes using bleeding edge chipsets and mobile frameworks, to delivering a world first mobile and cloud connected implanted device. BlueTooth, custom hardware, regulatory concerns, clinical trials, 37 language internationalisations, accessibility, distributed teams, custom cryptographic implementations, four platforms. A zen garden of Kanban surrounded by waterfalls.\n\nWe will look at the project and team aspects as well as coding and technical approaches, that enabled us to take this project from R&D to release, maintaining course and progress on top of shifting technologies, and operating a team in an organisation with complex technical and timeline interdependencies.\n\nMARK\nMark provides software R&D and other consulting services with The High Technology Bureau. He is the convenor of Sydney CocoaHeads, the co-chair of YOW! Connected Conference, and has been involved with many other meet ups and conferences. Over his grey hair inducing career he has worked across a wide range of sectors including medical devices, banking, retail, and management consulting.\n\nFor more information on YOW!
