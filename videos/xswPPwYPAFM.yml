title: 'Code Generation in the Java Compiler: Annotation Processors Do the Hard Work'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433258905
description: "The Java compiler and annotation processors are powerful tools within the Java platform, and both, combined, unleash great power in developersâ€™ hands, as this session illustrates. Triggered during the Java compilation process, APs can be used to generate new sources and confirmation from metadata present in the class source. Why expend time creating a BeanInfo class or dealing with boring XML configuration files when you can have them easily created at compilation time? Moreover, APs are compatible with IDEs and build tools, and hence they are virtually everywhere your Java code is. Unleash the power of annotation processors, and let them do the hard work for you.\n\n\nAuthor:\nJorge Hidalgo\nNo bio available\nView more trainings by Jorge Hidalgo at https://www.parleys.com/author/jorge-hidalgo-1\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
