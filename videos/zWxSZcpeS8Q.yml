description: "http://www.Cppcon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2015\n—\nWith the ending of Moore's Law and the rise of multicore systems, programmers from across the industry are increasing forced to develop and maintain highly performance sensitive software. For C++, a language frequently used for performance sensitive projects, benchmarking and performance analysis is especially important. Developing good benchmarks can be tricky; gathering and analyzing data from benchmarks can be an even greater challenge.\n\nThis talk will discuss techniques and best practices for writing C++ benchmarks using facilities from the standard library and Boost. We'll also cover the development of performance unit/regression tests. We'll discuss the statistical best practices for gathering data, as well as techniques for benchmarking a variety of different metrics - time, memory, algorithmic complexity, etc. \n\nThe main topics which will be covered:\n\n* Statistical Best Practices (dealing with uncertainty, achieving statistical confidence, how to sample)\n* Time-Based Benchmarking (best practices for timing, derived time-based metrics)\n* Non-Time-Based Benchmarking (memory, algorithmic complexity in time and space, etc)\n* Techniques for C++-specific Performance Metrics (counting copies/moves, allocator tricks) \n* Converting Benchmarks into Tests\n— \nBryce Adelstein-Lelbach is a researcher at the Center of Computation and Technology (CCT) at Louisiana State University. He works on the HPX runtime system and his research interests include parallel and distributed programming frameworks for scientific applications. He has been working on HPX for over a year now.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
