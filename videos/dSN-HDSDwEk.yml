title: 'Observability across serverless asynchronous managed services - Aviad Mor'
recordingDate: 1582968857
description: 'Serverless computing transactions are a combination of owned code (like AWS Lambda) and managed services (Like SNS, SQS, EventBridge, DynamoDB and more). Applying distributed tracing on your own code through instrumentation is relatively simple (though require a lot of work). The challenge lays with the managed service, how to trace a full transaction across services like queues, streams, and databases.'
