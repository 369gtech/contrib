description: "Google I/O 2009 - V8: Building a High Performance JavaScript Engine\r\n\r\nMads Ager\r\n\r\nV8 is Google's high-performance JavaScript engine used in Google Chrome.  V8 is optimized for well-designed object-oriented applications that make heavy use of objects, function calls, and property access.  This talk will provide an overview of the internals of V8 and dive into the advanced virtual-machine technology used.  Specifically, details of the use of hidden classes, inline caching, precise generational garbage collection, and snapshotting will be presented.  The final part of the talk will discuss initiatives that will propel V8 to the next performance level.\r\n\r\nFor presentation slides and all I/O sessions, please go to: code.google.com/events/io/sessions.html"
