description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nWebAssembly + OpenFaas, the Universal Runtime for Serverless Functions - Ramiro Berrelleza, Okteto \n\nWebAssembly was initially created as a sandbox for the Web. It was designed to be lightweight, portable and compatible with most programming languages. Given these characteristics, it's no surprise that a lot of people are starting to take it outside the browser and into the realm of desktop and cloud applications.  In this talk I'll discuss why WebAssembly is perfectly suited as a runtime for serverless functions. I'll discuss how WebAssembly can be used to build serverless functions, how it compares with Docker and other runtimes and how we can leverage it to make our functions more portable and faster to start.  I'll finish with a demo of how we can build functions in different languages, compile them to portable WebAssembly binaries and then use OpenFaaS to manage and deploy them the same way we do with traditional functions. \n\nhttps://sched.co/aYpr"
