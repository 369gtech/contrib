title: 'Mechatronics Mechanical System Control - It''s the Software!'
recordingDate: 1191901882
description: "Google Tech Talks\nSeptember 21, 2006\n\nDavid Auslander\n\nABSTRACT\nThe history of mechanical system control is one of striving for ever greater complexity. Ironically, with the modern mechatronics era, system complexity has increased beyond the wildest dreams of the early system designers while, in many instances, the mechanical part of the system has become simpler.\n\nDespite the mechanics/electronics of the mechatronics name, software has become the real driver for mechanical system complexity. System value and competitive advantage derive from better conceived and better executed software.\n\nDesign and implementation of control software for mechanical systems depends on: Design context Design..."
