description: "Download the audio at InfoQ: https://bit.ly/2KnJc2G \n\nJustin Lee starts by looking at the layout and syntax of Kotlin projects. He then moves to a more in-depth discussion on how these new language features combine to present a compelling new alternative to the Java source language. He looks at a few \"big ticket\" features of the language and its ecosystem that do more to distinguish Kotlin than mere syntax sugar alone can provide.\nThis presentation was recorded at QCon New York 2018: https://bit.ly/2JFHitG  \n\nThe next QCon is QCon London 2019 - March 4-6, 2019: https://bit.ly/2hxsoN1 \n\nFor more awesome presentations on innovator and early adopter topics check InfoQâ€™s selection of talks from conferences worldwide https://bit.ly/2tm9loz\n\nInterested in Java?
