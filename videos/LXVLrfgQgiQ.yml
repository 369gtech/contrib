description: "Functional programming continues to pick up steam as evidenced by growing mainstream interest in languages like Scala, Haskell, Erlang and Clojure. The day when functional programming might be widely employed no longer seems so distant. But will that day represent an apex for the programming craft? Don't bet on it. This talk will explore the benefits of logic programming and it's advantages over functional programming. But do not despair - this talk will explore why the functional and logic programming paradigms work even better when paired. In fact functional programming might provide a better foundation for logic programming than any other. \n\n\n\n\nLiked the song? It's \"Tank\" by Seatbelts"
