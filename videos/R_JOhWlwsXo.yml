description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nBuild Your Own Private 5G Network on Kubernetes - Frank Zdarsky, Red Hat & Raymond Knopp, Eurecom \n\nPrivate 5G networks are dedicated cellular networks, confined to user premises and tailored to a specific use case. In smart factories, for instance, they may soon enable remote control of robots, augmented reality-enhanced maintenance, and other use cases for which ultra-low latency, high bandwidth, and reliable radio connectivity to local edge computing services is a must.    Did you know you can build your own private 5G network purely from open source software and off the shelf hardware? This session will introduce OpenAirInterface, an open source 5G radio and core network implementation, and how to pick and set up hardware for it. Participants will learn how the latest Kubernetes technologies like Multus, SR/IOV CNI, real-time workers, device plugins, etc. need to come together to support these exigent Containerized Network Functions on Kubernetes and to manage them using Operators. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UaWZ"
