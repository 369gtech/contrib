description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nMcK8s: Container Orchestration in Kubernetes Multi-Clusters - Mulugeta Ayalew Tamiru, University of Rennes 1 / Elastisys AB\n\nToday many companies deploy their workloads across multiple Kubernetes clusters in private and public cloud data centers or in emerging computing paradigms such as Fog Computing. Recent efforts in the community such as KubeFed address some of the multi-cluster deployment challenges. However, KubeFed currently offers only manual or fully load-balanced placement. Other challenges such as autoscaling and inter-cluster network routing are solved by other projects separately. In this context, we believe there is a need for a more integrated and autonomous approach for managing geo-distributed Kubernetes clusters at scale. In this talk, we will present mck8s -- an extension and partial replacement of KubeFed for geo-distributed computing environments which aims to bring placement, autoscaling, bursting, inter-cluster routing, and cluster provisioning into one package. We will also emphasize its usability and easy adoption by using manifest files very much similar to vanilla Kubernetes."
