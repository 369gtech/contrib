language: English
recordingDate: 1543722703
description: 'Kevin founded a startup focused on opening up the potential of cannabis-derived medicine, by replacing plant growth with engineered microorganisms. His side projects include Bricobio - the DIY bio/biohacker/indie science community in Montreal - and heâ€™s also a director of Helios Makerspace. Kevin will speak about his work hacking the genome of yeast to make it produce THC. Being that this process is more in alignment with current pharmaceutical practices and is able to scale much more effectively, he hopes this approach will enable many to explore the benefits of Cannabis-related medicine and products more consistently.'
