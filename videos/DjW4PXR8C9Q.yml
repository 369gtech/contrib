title: 'Jacek Laskowski "Apache Tomcat + Java EE 6 Web Profile = Apache TomEE"'
recordingDate: 1358528864
description: "It nearly impossible to imagine a Java EE landscape without Apache Tomcat -- one of the many application servers supporting Java EE 6 web applications. It's neat and a very lightweight platform for web applications of any kind. Some would warmly welcome the other features of a full-blown Java EE 6 application server -- CDI, EJB, JAX-RS, and perhaps JMS. Rather than composing your application server yourself, give TomEE a try!\n\nIn this presentation you'll find out what the Java EE 6 Web Profile offers and how little it takes to learn TomEE with or without prior familiarity with Tomcat."
