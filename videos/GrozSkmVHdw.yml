One of the most difficult challenges to watching movies with others around the world, however, is syncing playback together. Kubernetes is a great solution to solving this challenge. Through its built in ability to load balance traffic to containers, as well as self-healing capabilities, video streaming is able to function seamlessly without a large amount of computational overhead. This talk will provide a quick background on WebRTC, walk through a simplified process of setting up WebRTC to work with Kubernetes, and share some learnings/takeaways gathered from spinning up this project!"
