description: "Meteor is a new development platform that makes it dramatically faster to write rich web applications in pure JavaScript. In this talk from HTML5DevConf, Matt DeBergails, founder of Meteor asks, \"how do we build this new style of application that's just fundamentally different than the tooling, and the practices that we've learned over the last ten years building for a server-centric environment?\"\n\nMatt will address some of the challenges associated with building client-side apps, and how Meteor's packages work together to create an exceptional development experience.\n\n**More educational resources on open source development at: http://marakana.com/"
