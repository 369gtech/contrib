title: 'AngularJS Tutorial #16 - Views and Routes'
language: English
recordingDate: 1457088095
description: "Hey all, in this AngularJS tutorial, I'll be showing you how we can section off our content into Angular 'views', and then use ngRoute (AngularJS's routing module) to configure our routes for the application. Views are essentially the 'states' or the 'pages' of our application, and are requested by Angular when a user goes to a specific route, or URL.\n\nHey gang, in this AngularJS tutorial, I'll be introducing you to filters and how we can use them to change the way our data is displayed to a user. Filters can be used in conjunction with ng-repeat, or directly on the expression itself. We use Angular filters to do things like ordering a list of items alphabetically, or by type, or to display numbers as a currency.\n\n----- COURSE LINKS:\n+ Source files on GitHub - https://github.com/iamshaunjp/angular-js-playlist\n+ Atom text editor - https://atom.io/\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nYou can find more front-end development tutorials on CSS, HTML, JavaScript, jQuery, WordPress & more on the channel homepage...\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO CHANNEL - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5Y...\n\n========== JavaScript for Beginners Playlist ==========\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\n\n============ CSS for Beginners Playlist =============\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\n\n============== The Net Ninja =====================\n\nFor more front-end development tutorials & to black-belt your coding skills, head over to http://thenetninja.co.uk\n\n================== Social Links ==================\n\nTwitter - @TheNetNinja - https://twitter.com/thenetninjauk"
