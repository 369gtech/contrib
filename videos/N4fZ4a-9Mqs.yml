description: "Crucible: Towards a Safer and Consistent BOSH Job Interface - James Myers & Aram Price, Pivotal\n\nCrucible is a project to provide a declarative interface for defining BOSH jobs and executing them in a secure and consistent environment.\n\nCrucible takes advantage of containerization via RunC to isolate BOSH jobs on a host to provide improvements for release developers as well as operators. The declarative configuration simplifies the release author experience, and Crucible will handle many of the hand-rolled BOSH-job housekeeping tasks such as managing PID files, log redirection, and directory creation. For the operator Crucible provides better security since jobs will not have unrestricted access to the host VM.\n\nIn this talk, James Myers and Aram Price will discuss the development and design of Crucible.\nThey will cover the improvements to the release developer's experience, and the security and stability benefits for operators.\n\nTopics will include: \nAn in depth look at how Crucible utilizes RunC to provide release authors and operators with isolated execution environments by default.\n\nA detailed comparisons between the existing BOSH release interface and Crucible's simplified declarative interface,\nExamples of how to convert existing bosh releases to use Crucible and the various benefits it provides currently.\nThe possibilities that Crucible enables for the future.\n\nAbout James Myers\nJames Myers is a software engineer for Pivotal Software and a core contributor to the Cloud Foundry project. James is currently working on security related projects around Cloud Foundry and BOSH. Previously, James has worked extensively on the core open source Cloud Foundry teams, including the Diego and CF Runtime teams for over 3 years.\n\nAbout Aram Price\nPivotal"
