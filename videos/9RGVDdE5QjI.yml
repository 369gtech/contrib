description: "Speaker: Sergey Shishkin (STANDARD CHARTERED BANK)\n\nWeâ€™ll start with an easy to understand imperative program written in Java and, equipped with basic clean code principles, refactor it to idiomatic functional code. Along the way we move from mutable state to referential transparency, replace loops with recursion and discover higher order functions, which we start seeing everywhere.\n\nSergey is a software professional and programming languages enthusiast with over 15 years of experience."
