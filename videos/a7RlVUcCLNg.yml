description: "Panellists: \nAdrienne Lowe (Director of Engineering)\nAlexandra Sobhani (Engineering Manager, Google)\nKwasi Ohene-Adu (CEO, Groovetime)\nSpencer Norman (Senior Engineering Manager, Mailchimp)\n\nOne-to-ones provide perhaps your greatest opportunity to survey how well things are going with your team. \n\nBut a perfect one-to-one isn’t always the easiest thing to craft. Sometimes they can become overly operational or focus only on short-term steps. And for some people opening up in a one-to-one can be hard, and unless you put in work into making a space safe feel safe, you may not be able to grasp what’s really going on. \n\nIn this session, we’ll be exploring the art of the one-to-one, discussing how to build trust so that your team is willing to share what’s going on, and think about how to adapt one-to-ones to a remote environment"
