description: "This video was recorded at ElixirConf EU Virtual 2020 - https://www.elixirconf.eu/\n\nMore great virtual tech conferences - https://codesync.global \n\n---\n\nMembrane Framework - the true story of handling multimedia in Elixir\nby\nMarcin Lewandowski\n\nABSTRACT\nMedia processing has never been a piece of cake - a large amount of data, tons of different formats, protocols and standards, growing latency and quality requirements. In this talk, weâ€™ll introduce you to the world of media streaming via Membrane Framework - our solution for dealing with multimedia without pain. The framework provides a set of so-called elements, which are composable blocks implementing different multimedia processing operations. The talk will be based on the real use cases of the framework and will explain - what are use cases for such a framework - what are the benefits of using such a framework in comparison to other solutions, - what is the roadmap for the framework, especially in terms of supporting WebRTC.\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - Marcin Lewandowski\nHe founded his first IT company when he was still in high school. A graduate of Human-Computer Interaction at Jagiellonian University in Poland. He was bouncing between media and IT industries for quite a while. Founded a cult local FM radio station, then RadioKit, a SaaS startup aiming at building software for the media industry and then smoothly migrated into multimedia. Currently a partner at Software Mansion - a fast-growing software agency serving mostly US startups.\n\n---\n\nElixirConf EU\nWebsite: https://www.elixirconf.eu/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ElixirConfEU"
