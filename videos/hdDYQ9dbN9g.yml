description: "Title: Beyond JavaScript Frameworks: Writing Reliable Web Apps With Elm\n\nIn times where a jungle of JavaScript frameworks wants to solve every conceivable problem in web app development, Elm offers a different approach. Elm is a functional language that compiles to JavaScript. It has a user-friendly compiler, a sound type system, built-in immutability and lots of other features that come in handy when developing large, hopefully bug-free, single-page apps. While having fun in the process! In this talk you'll see how Elm works and learn how to use it to build a web app. More importantly, you'll learn the pros and cons of using it over a JavaScript-based solution."
