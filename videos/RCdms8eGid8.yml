description: "Speaker: Atreya Biswas\n\nDescription\nUsing Luigi and Scikit-Learn to create a Machine Learning Pipeline which trains a model and predict through a Rest API\n\nAbstract\nA Machine Learning Pipeline can be broadly thought of as many tasks which includes - Data Ingestion - Data Cleaning - Feature Extraction - Training Models - Hyper Parameter Optimization - Model Evaluation - Model Deployment. Luigi is Spotify's open sourced Python framework for batch data processing including dependency resolution, workflow resolution, visualisation, handling failures and monitoring. Scikit-Learn is the most popular and widely used Machine Learning Library in Python. We will demonstrate how Luigi and Scikit-Learn can be used to orchestrate the Machine Learning Tasks, hence creating a cohesive Machine Learning Pipeline.\n\nEvent Page: https://pycon.sg\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/P6Rz/"
