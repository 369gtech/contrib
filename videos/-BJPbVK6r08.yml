description: "Stories are the foundation of human experience. They are what define us, individually and collectively. They engage us, entertain us, bring us together and drive us apart.\n\nWhat stories do you tell about you? Who knows your stories? Everyone? Perhaps just a select few? Maybe, just you.\n\nIn this session, we explore how our individual journeys to self-acceptance and alignment are also the heart of how we can work with and support teams. We will learn about how to truly help teams move towards agility, by helping them find and own their process and tell their own story. So they stay aligned and can continually realign when their context changes.\n\nWhy authenticity and self-acceptance matters for both individuals and teams. How to create lasting change in teams, without imposing process or creating learned helplessness.\n\nHow to help teams own their process and tell their own story.\n\nOver the last 20 years, John has helped countless teams. But in the last 3 years, when his world was turned upside down, he realised that changing a team is exactly what gets in the way of a team changing.\n\nJohn has spent most of the last 2 decades working in the software industry, with a focus on web technologies. After 10 years as a software engineer John moved into consultancy where he quickly learned the value of team dynamics and how most technical challenges are projecting underlying issues with collaboration. So his focus shifted, while still being very involved technically, his first focus is on facilitating a safe, creative, collaborative environment.\n\nAs well as his coaching and consultancy work, John also produces The Agile Path podcast\n\nFor more on YOW!
