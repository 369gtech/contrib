language: English
recordingDate: 1557444938
description: "A Trusted Web Activity (TWA) displays a full screen Chrome browser inside of an Android app with no browser UI. Although Android apps routinely include web content using a Chrome Custom Tab (CCT) or WebView, a TWA offers unique advantages when you need Chrome’s performance and features in your app in full screen mode. This talk will cover how to get started using a Trusted Web Activity, case studies and quality criteria for inclusion in the Play store. \n\nWatch more #io19 here: \nWeb at Google I/O 2019 Playlist → https://goo.gle/io19web\nGoogle I/O 2019 All Sessions Playlist → https://goo.gle/io19allsessions \nLearn more on the I/O Website → https://google.com/io\n\nSubscribe to the Chrome Developers Channel → https://goo.gle/ChromeDevs\nGet started at → https://www.google.com/chrome/dev/\n\nSpeaker(s): Peter McLachlan, Andre Bandarra\n\nT5A5E8"
