description: "In this talk I am going to share how Elixir's deployment tooling has gotten to where it is today, what problems we've addressed, what problems remain, and going into the future, how we're planning to evolve and improve.\n\nThe practical problems the tools aimed to address early on have been largely resolved. However, as Elixir draws more developers from other languages, we've had to face the fact that we have not only a perception problem, but a variety of usability issues that early adopters have largely not noticed or cared about. Addressing these problems is the primary goal of the next stage of evolution in these tools, as well as making releases part of the core Elixir toolchain.\n\nIf you are currently deploying Elixir in production, or are looking to do so, you will be interested in this talk.\n\nMore details here: https://codesync.global/speaker/paul-schoenfelder/"
