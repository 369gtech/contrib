description: 'What festivals are happening this summer near me? Where can I catch a jazz concert, see a comedy show, find a performance of MacBeth, or participate in a 5K race? Millions of users ask Google questions like these about upcoming events every day — but to answer well, Google needs *structured data* directly from the most authoritative websites for each event. In this talk, we''ll describe how event organizers, performers, venues, ticketers, and website hosts can participate in Google''s new event search features. We''ll cover: the new JSON-LD markup format; new schema.org properties for specifying event information in detail; how events are linked to the Knowledge Graph; and what it takes to show your events in Search, Google Now, Maps, and more.'
