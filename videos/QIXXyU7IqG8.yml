recordingDate: 1515769557
description: 'Every enterprise system has tons of sensitive data like database passwords or third-party API keys. Quite often people store this data openly in internal repositories, continuous integration pipeline or configuration managements systems. The bigger company the stricter security rules. It is more complex and important when you have thousands of different applications and each one has its own secrets. In this talk I am giving an overview of my personal experience on Vault technology and will show by example how you can build your own policies and move your secrets to the Vault.'
