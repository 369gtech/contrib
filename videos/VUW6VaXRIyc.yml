Our focus is finite. Wrestling with complexity can overwhelm and demotivate even the smartest engineers, but there are ways we can make life a little easier. In this talk Hannah will propose a human approach to coping with complexity—something we all need to consider when building successful engineering teams—and will share how to begin applying user-centric design to reduce the cognitive load on developers.\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zh39"
