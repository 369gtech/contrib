Vue official router has been a pleasure to build apps with but as the community grows, so do the router needs. However, it hasn't kept up as good as Eduardo wish it had with all the good proposals out there. As a result, we have also taken more time to work on the new version of Vue router and shaping an API that will serve Vue 2 and Vue 3. A more extensible router, easier to contribute, and new architecture from scratch. Let's talk about what has changed in the new Router and all the improvements we are bringing."
