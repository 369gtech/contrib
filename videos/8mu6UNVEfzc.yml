description: "R&D (research and development) is not something that the entertainment industry is known for. But as narrative and code collide, new forms and functions of storytelling emerge. A culture of open R&D and rapid prototyping becomes critical in establishing a sustainable industry that can be adaptive to an ever shifting digital landscape. As the role of the audience and storytelling continue to blur we find ourselves at a unique moment in time where the rules haven’t been written and opportunity to shape a new grammar of storytelling emerges.\n\nJoin Lance Weiler founding member and director of the Columbia University Digital Storytelling Lab as he shares findings from the labs recent explorations into a re-imagining of the work of Arthur Conan Doyle titled Sherlock Holmes & the Internet of Things. A prototype that had 1,200 collaborators from 60+ countries working across 70 events to create a massive connected crime scene.\n\nLance Weiler\nWriter, Director & Experience Designer\nhttps://twitter.com/LanceWeiler\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/lanceweiler\nhttps://www.instagram.com/lanceweiler/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/lanceweiler?_rdr=p\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lance_Weiler\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
