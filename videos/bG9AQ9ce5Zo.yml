description: "Why Are Distributed Systems So Hard?\n\nDenise Yu, Pivotal\n\nDistributed systems are known for being notoriously difficult to wrangle. But why? This talk will cover a brief history of distributed computing, clear up some common myths about the CAP theorem, dig into why network partitions are inevitable, and closeout by highlighting how a few popular consensus algorithms mitigate the risks of operating in a distributed fashion. We'll also take a look at how to design systems for greater adaptability by human factors, which can help reduce the impact of programmatic uncertainty.\n\nhttps://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa19/conference-program"
