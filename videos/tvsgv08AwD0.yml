description: "Grand National 2021: Managing Extreme Online Demand at William Hill\n\nMatthew Berridge and Josh Allenby, William Hill\n\nThe Grand National is the biggest Horse Race in the world, watched by over 500 million people worldwide with 1 in 4 people in the UK placing a bet—it makes a Black Friday look like a wet Tuesday—it is William Hill's biggest betting day of the year. 2021 was a year like no other, with retail closed—online demand was huge. The challenge was coping with the demand of once-a-year customers whilst maintaining service to our long-serving customers. This talk looks at how SRE prepared for and ran the day and how we implemented lambda@edge logic and a queueing system to help us achieve this.\n\nView the full SREcon21 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon21/program"
