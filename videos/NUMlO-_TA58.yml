title: 'Attack of the Tails: Yes, you Really can Backdoor Federated Learning'
language: English
recordingDate: 1622842526
description: "A Google TechTalk, 2020/7/30, presented by Dimitris Papailiopoulos, University of Wisconsin-Madison\nABSTRACT:  Due to its decentralized nature, Federated Learning (FL) lends itself to adversarial attacks in the form of backdoors during training.  A range of FL backdoor attacks have been introduced in the literature, but also methods to defend against them, and it is currently an open question whether FL systems can be tailored to be robust against backdoors. In this work, we provide evidence to the contrary. We first establish that robustness to backdoors implies model robustness to adversarial examples, a major open problem in itself. Furthermore, detecting the presence of a backdoor in a FL model is unlikely assuming first order oracles or polynomial time. We couple our theoretical results with a new family of backdoor attacks, which we refer to as edge-case backdoors. An edge-case backdoor forces a model to misclassify on seemingly easy inputs that are however unlikely to be part of the training, or test data, i.e., they live on the tail of the input distribution. We explain how these edge-case backdoors can lead to unsavory failures and may have serious repercussions on fairness, and  exhibit that with careful tuning at the side of the adversary, one can insert them across a range of machine learning tasks (e.g., image classification, OCR, text prediction, sentiment analysis)."
