title: 'Sirar Salih Automating Tinder in the Cloud and the day I broke Tinder... by accident at Mobile Era'
recordingDate: 1574413538
description: "It was a cold day in December of 2018, I was sitting with my developer friends at a local pub in Oslo. Inspired by our conversations, I got the idea to finally fix the \"Tinder problem\". We're all so tired of swiping, it's about time we automated this thing!\n\nNever did I imagine what I'd get myself into, the intrigues and the drama that would follow. Sure, investigating the Tinder API was easy enough. Sure, building an Azure function and deploying it to the cloud to fully automate Tinder was not a big deal. But finding exposed personal information from the Tinder API, a security threat in the OAuth 2.0 protocol and eventually getting my account locked by Facebook?! Taking down Tinder by accident and seeing this event unfold all over the media?!\n\nNever did I imagine I'd have so much fun and learn so much along the way, building my automated Tinder cloud app.\n\nSit back, relax and come watch my talk. You're in for a wild ride!\n\nAbout the speaker\nSirar Salih is CTO with primary focus on Azure initiatives at Itera and a Microsoft Azure MVP. He is a very active speaker and community organizer, organizing meetups for the Azure User Group Norway and the Norwegian .NET User Group Oslo. Sirar loves sharing knowledge and has experience from speaking at international conferences such as Build Stuff, the Norwegian Developers Conference and JavaZone. He also contributes to the open source community by blogging at: https://sirarsalih.com.\n\nAbout Mobile Era\nMobile Era is organized by a team of enthusiasts across several technology companies in Oslo.
