description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nHow Spotify Leverages Flyte To Coordinate Financial Analytics Company-Wide - Haytham Abuelfutuh, Union.ai & Dylan Wilder Patterson, Spotify\n\nKubernetes’ popularity stems from its declarative yaml based API and focus on versioning and other best practices of developing micro-services. Therein also lies its weakness, where users that are not conversant with infrastructure are inadvertently discouraged from leveraging the power of Kubernetes. Using an example application at Spotify that powers their financial platform, the talk examines:\n* The specific operational needs of ML and Data Engineering (MLOps/DataOps) in contrast to DevOps.\n* Best practices for developing maintainable ML and Data applications.\n* How Flyte can be used to bridge these gaps for users with varying technical proficiency."
