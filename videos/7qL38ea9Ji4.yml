description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\ngRPC Communication Patterns – A Deep Dive - Kasun Indrasiri & Danesh Kuruppu, WSO2 \n\nReal-World microservices implementations often use a variety of communication protocols and standards to build different services. gRPC has emerged as an efficient, reliable, and robust way to build inter-microservice communication owing to its rich service definition capabilities with protocol buffers, a variety of language support, and high performance. In this session, we will discuss how gRPC can be used to build inter-microservices communications. In this talk, we’ll explore fundamental gRPC communication patterns; Unary RPC, Server-side Streaming, Client-side Streaming, and Bi-directional Streaming, Understanding when and how to use gRPC Interceptors, Deadlines, Cancellation, Error Handling, Multiplexing, and Metadata, a network analysis of how gRPC communication works behind the scenes. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ekCZ"
