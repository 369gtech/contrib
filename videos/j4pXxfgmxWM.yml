description: "Keith Packard\nhttp://linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/65/\nChaosKey is a true random number generator. It contains a noise source\r\nand an ARM SoC with a USB interface and provides about 1MB/s of random\r\nbits, suitable for replenishing the meager supply available in a\r\ntypical Linux machine. All of the hardware designs, firmware, linux\r\ndrivers and other software are available under share-alike\r\nlicenses. The hardware and software development tools are also free\r\nsoftware.\r\n\r\nDevelopment of ChaosKey started almost three years ago, and the first\r\nbatch of 1000 that we've built was received in August and made\r\navailable for sale.\r\n\r\nThis presentation will describe the hardware and software design\r\nprocess, including the many dead ends and hardware iterations\r\nsymptomatic of a software engineer's approach to hardware\r\ndesign. Portions of the hardware were adapted from other free hardware\r\nprojects showing how ideas from share-alike software licenses can be\r\nsuccessful in the world of hardware too."
