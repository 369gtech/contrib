description: "Google I/O 2010 - Open source Google Wave: Building your own wave provider \r\n\r\nWave 101 \r\n\r\nDan Peterson, Jochen Bekmann, J.D. Zamfirescu Pereira, David LaPalomento (Novell) \r\n\r\nLearn how to build your own wave service. Google is open sourcing the lion's share of the code that went into creating Google Wave to help bootstrap a network of federated providers. This talk will discuss the state of the reference implementation: the software architecture, how you can plug it into your own use cases -- and how you can contribute to the code and definition of the underlying specification. \r\n\r\nFor all I/O 2010 sessions, please go to http://code.google.com/events/io/2010/sessions.html"
