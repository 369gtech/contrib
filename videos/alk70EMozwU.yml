description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2012\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nJohn Davies - CTO & Founder of Incept5\n\nABSTRACT\nSometimes you just know something should be running faster, but as long as it runs fast enough you leave it as-is. Then, a few clients start having interesting challenges and you realise you're going to need to start tuning the JVM to address the issues encountered. In this presentation, John will walk through two real-world performance tuning scenarios that he has encountered - topics to be covered include memory usage, object creation, I/O throttling, serialisation, benchmarking and testing. Although the majority of it is not rocket science, it can be astonishing how a few small changes can make a huge difference to the performance of a JVM application. When do you have to consider giving up object-oriented elegance in exchange for specific optimisations based on the way the JVM works? How much of an impact does object allocation have on a modern JVM? How good are developers at guessing where the real bottleneck is? Join us to learn the answers to these questions, and to gain insight into what's really involved in JVM tuning.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
