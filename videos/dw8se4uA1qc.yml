description: "JavaFX 8.0 introduces actual parallelism in its implementation, along with overall performance improvement that brings increased complexity of JavaFX runtime behavior. Understanding its basics becomes very important in application optimization and performance tuning work. In this session, you will learn about the current JavaFX architecture from a performance perspective, what performance-related information is provided by the JavaFX runtime, and how that information should be interpreted in the right context.\n\n\nAuthor:\nOleg Mazurov\nOleg Mazurov is a member of the JavaFX Performance Team at Oracle. His major task and contribution is performance analysis of the\nentire JavaFX stack on all supported platforms: Windows, Mac OS, Linux. Before joining the client Java organization he worked at Sun on performance analysis tools, part of the Sun Studio Compilers and Tools collection.\n\nView more trainings by Oleg Mazurov at https://www.parleys.com/author/oleg-mazurov\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
