description: "by Mario Torre and Marcus Hirt\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/H.1302/imc.webm\n\n\nRecently open sourced, JDK Mission Control is the industry standard tool for Java performance analysis in production environments. This presentation will introduce the tool and explain how to use it to solve various production time problems with very little overhead. \n\nWe will also discuss how application developers can extend their applications to take advantage of the event recording capabilities of the JDK Flight Recorder, now included in OpenJDK 11, and how to create custom tools based on the extensive Mission Control API to analyse specific issues beyond what is offered by default by the Eclipse based tool. \n\nAt the end a demo will be shown using the JDK Flight Recorder, JDK Mission Control and OpenTracing together to facilitate deep distributed tracing capabilities. \n\nRoom: H.1302 (Depage)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 14:50:00+01"
