recordingDate: 1523571127
description: "Have you ever been up late at night wrestling with your slow/down website and drawn a blank as to what to do, or even where to look?\n\nDo you wish to know a little bit more about how things work so you can troubleshoot performance issues with your Drupal site more effectively? We got you covered.\n\nThis presentation will distill 5 years of experience dealing with site outages in the Acquia Operations team into an one-hour presentation. We will discuss various types of server and service metrics, how to gather them, and how to use them to troubleshoot and resolve problems with your infrastructure.\n\nThe intended audience: Drupal site builders/administrators that have basic understanding of the command line and know how to SSH into their systems, but are still fuzzy on system administration concepts.\n\nAttendees will learn some no-nonsense fundamentals that they can immediately apply in troubleshooting performance and availability issues on their stack.\n\nBut wait, there's more! There will be two companion Birds of a Feather sessions for attendees to ask questions and get access to infrastucture expertise."
