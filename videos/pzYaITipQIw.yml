recordingDate: 1484803126
description: "Cedric BAIL\nhttp://linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/55/\nEnlightenment Foundation Libraries has been in development for more than a decade. Targeting from day one embedded device, it is now used by Samsung in all its Galaxy Gear smartwatch, a few smartphone and all the new TV. At the forefront of energy consumption constraint, this talk will cover, after a short coverage of what Enlightenment Foundation Libraries are and provide, all the technics used to optimize its CPU, memory and energy efficiency.\r\n\r\nMost of this technics will become more and more relevant with the obsolescence of Moore's law and the energy barrier ahead. This talk should be useful to anyone working on getting the most of the hardware they have and be as efficient as possible. For those interested in graphics rendering, we will cover a lot of the technics we use for our software and OpenGL rendering."
