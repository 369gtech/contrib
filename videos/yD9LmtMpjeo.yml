description: "by Romain Picard\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/UB2.252A/python2020_reactive_programming.webm\n\nReactive Programming is an event based programming method. ReactiveX is a cross-platform implementation of Reactive Programming. It is heavily inspired from functional programming and contains many operators that allow to create, modify, and combine streams of events. Moreover it is composable and extensible. This short introduction presents Reactive Programming through RxPY, the Python implementation of ReactiveX.\nThe aim of this talk is to present RxPY to people that never used it, or used RxPY v1:\n\n\n❮ul❯\n❮li❯Reactive Programming, ReactiveX, and RxPY❮/li❯\n❮li❯The Reactive Hello World❮/li❯\n❮li❯How to deal with errors❮/li❯\n❮li❯how to deal with concurrency❮/li❯\n❮li❯A real life example❮/li❯\n❮/ul❯\n\n\nRoom: UB2.252A (Lameere)\nScheduled start: 2020-02-01 14:30:00"
