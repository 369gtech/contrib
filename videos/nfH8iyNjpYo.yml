description: "Google Tech Talk\nApril 26, 2012\n\nPresented by Daniel B. Ravicher\n\nABSTRACT\n\nAmerica's patent system dates back to the founding of our nation when it was expressly included in the Constitution.  To be sure, a patent system can provide many great benefits to society.  However, patents also pose a great threat to society because the issuance of a patent makes it illegal for any American to do whatever is claimed by the patent.  Thus, it is critically important to the success of our patent system that it maintain high patent quality and ensures only deserving patents are issued.\n\nUnfortunately, the American patent system today is suffering from extremely low patent quality.  Every Tuesday the Patent Office issues 4,000 patents after spending on average less than a couple days in reviewing the merits of each patent application.  When asked to reconsider the merits of patents it previously issued, the Patent Office concedes that the vast majority of them have questionable validity. When patents end up in court as a result of patent owners suing alleged infringers, a large percentage of the time those asserted patents are found to have been improperly granted.  The result is a polluted patent system littered with trash patents that impede technological development.\n\nIn this Google Tech Talk, Prof. Daniel B. Ravicher of the Public Patent Foundation and Benjamin N. Cardozo School of law will explain why patent quality is so low in America today, describe in detail the ways in which low patent quality is harming Americans, and propose mechanisms for solving the low patent quality problem.\n\nSpeaker: Daniel B.
