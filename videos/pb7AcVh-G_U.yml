description: "(Recorded at Jfokus 2016. http://www.jfokus.com)\n\nMaking Darwin Proud: Coding Evolutionary Algorithms in Java\n\nJava Developers sometimes face programming challenges, such as creating a school roster or determining a salesperson's optimal route, that are extremely difficult to crack using conventional approaches. Discover how Evolutionary Algorithms can be applied to solve these complex puzzles. The session starts with a success story from the NASA space archives to explain the concepts. Once the stage is set, it's puzzle solving time! Learn to code Evolutionary Algorithms using plain Java - although existing Java frameworks such as JGAP are also addressed. The session concludes with a checklist that can be used to determine whether Evolutionary Algorithms are a good fit to the problem. With this checklist, the decision has never been easier!\n\nBas W. Knopper, JDriven\n\nBas is a Java consultant at JDriven, which enables him to gain experience with Java in different settings and domains. In his spare time, after the little one is fast asleep, he enjoys coding Evolutionary Algorithms, fidgeting with the Twitter API, playing with RxJava and experimenting with (other) latest Java developments."
