description: "JSLA Thursday Aug 30th, 2012 - Jeff Pelton @comster\nToday in the browser you can decode audio, parse metadata and album art, using Audio API & File API's, preview files on your computer using FileReader and upload them using XHR2 with HTML progress bars for the best user experience, build visualizations using a drawing library like D3.js and more.\n\nJukebox.js is an open source experiment showing what you can do with some of the latest web technologies like file access, audio playback, chat, and real time collaboration. The web app is built with tools including backbone.js, socket.io, aurora.js, dancer.js, and more. The server is built on house.js, a node.js open source platform as a service to provide RESTful interfaces to authentication, file systems, data and media.\n\nWe'll take a quick look at the broad strategy for modern web app development, then we'll dive into as many of these great HTML features and open source javascript libraries as we can!"
