title: '"The JavaScript Interpreter, Interpreted" by Martha Girdler'
language: English
recordingDate: 1614358264
description: "JavaScript is misunderstood. It looks like C, acts like Lisp, but deviates in important and confusing ways. It can mimic classical behavior but is built on prototypes. It has blocks but doesn’t provide block scope. Then, throw in the magical “this” keyword and we have a recipe for interpreted disaster. Understanding how JavaScript creates and executes function objects is key to understanding JavaScript. In this talk we'll walk through the JavaScript interpreter in an easy-to-follow no-confusing-jargon manner. You'll leave with a better understanding of vanilla JavaScript!\n\nMartha Girdler\n@marthakelly\n\n\nMartha Girdler is a Software Engineer who is continually surprised at how much she loves programming. In a previous life she was a developer at Cheezburger Network, a student at Hacker School, and she is currently a Software Engineer on the Shipping team at Etsy. She cares a lot about coffee, bourbon, cats, and giving everyone the opportunity to learn to code.\n\n\nRecorded at Strange Loop conference (https://thestrangeloop.com) in St. Louis, MO, Oct 2013."
