title: 'KotlinConf 2017 - Asynchronous Programming with Kotlin Coroutines in Spring by Konrad Kami?ski'
language: English
recordingDate: 1510747847
description: "Coroutines is a new feature in Kotlin 1.1. It allows for writing an asynchronous code almost like it was regular/synchronous. If you combine it with Spring you'll get a powerful tool for creating fast, scalable, non-blocking applications.\n\nThis session shows how coroutines can be used in Spring-based applications, what sort of problems can be encountered and how to solve them. I also present a glimpse of the spring-kotlin-coroutine library, which is a one-stop solution for Spring/coroutines interoperability.\n\nI'm a software engineer at Allegro, a major Polish e-commerce company. I have 20 years of experience in the IT industry in various roles (mostly as a developer and technical leader) in software companies. I spent the last 17 years of my career with Java-related technologies. For the past 18 months, I've used Kotlin as my primary programming language (with delight). I blog a bit, give talks and contribute to open source projects."
