Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nMoving from Legacy Infrastructure to the Cloud in a Government Organization - Chris Carty, City Of Ottawa \n\nCloud native tech isn’t just for start-ups. But, if you’re in a government organization looking to go cloud native, you can expect to face extra challenges. How can you select the best tools that will work with the processes you already have? What new skills are needed? How do you train staff? How to get anyone to actually use the framework once it’s in place? How to even start?  The City of Ottawa (yes the capital of Canada) was an organization that started applying DevOps practices just a few years ago. It now has a Kubernetes platform with fully automated CICD pipelines being used by multiple teams and growing. Using The City as a case study, we will examine the common issues faced by government organizations and how The City developed workable solutions on its cloud native journey. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UabP"
