title: 'React Native EU 2020: Ormi Bruchim - Performance Does Matter - Making Your React-Native App Fast'
recordingDate: 1603292526
description: "Abstract:\nIn the past 5 years, the Wix mobile app has gone through quite a bit - a brand new look was launched, a large number of features were added in a short period of time, and the number of our users tripled. Unfortunately, one implication of product growth, is a slower performance, especially when it came to things like seamless transition, fluent animations and general slickness of the app. \n\nOver the past year, we made a tremendous effort to improve these regressions. Our ongoing efforts have so far resulted in almost 60% cumulative improvement in all performance metrics.\n\nIn this talk, I’ll deep into all of our secret ingredients for better performance in React Native applications, together with practical examples of:\n-Improving startup time\n-Responsive gestures \n-Preload prioritization\nFurthermore, I’ll outline some general work we’ve done that led us to these improvements, like the right way to measure and analyse your app performance on production, and how you can implement these tips and tricks."
