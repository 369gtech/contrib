description: "Speaker: Mario Van der Meulen, Principal Designer @ Foolproof Singapore\n\nAbout the speaker \n\nMario Van der Meulen believes that people ignore design that ignores people. He is a creative whoâ€™s able to see what others are saying. A versatile, ambidextrous designer who can think strategically and execute tactically. Formerly as creative director at Frog currently as a Principal Designer at Foolproof, he discovers, designs and delivers experience design principles. In our design-by-humans-for-humans world, Mario works to dispel the misconceptions about how breakthrough ideas for meaningful innovation are made. He gives a voice to the end-user, meaning to the solution, and value to the design thinking.\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/mariovdm\n\nEvent Page: https://uxsea.org/summit-2019\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG"
