title: 'Creating airplane mode proof Xamarin applications - Gerald Versluis'
recordingDate: 1528111216
description: "It has never been more important to create apps that also work offline. Mobile app users can flick that 'airplane mode' switch any given time and the cellular connection isn't as stable as it is at home. To ensure a great user-experience you, as a developer, need to account for these scenarios. And honestly: that can be a pain in the butt.\n\nIn this session I will show you how to use awesome libraries like Akavache and Polly to create connected apps in a very easy way. Step-by-step I will guide you through a sample application, so when we're done you can go home and implement it in your every app. Have a good flight!"
