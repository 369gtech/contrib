recordingDate: 1421078838
description: 'Communication and collaboration between developers and systems administrators represent a key aspect of the "devops" cultural movement that has been growing popularity in the last few years. Database administrators, most of the times, find themselves in between developers and sysadmins and their role is strategic. This talk will address some of the main concepts of "devops" as well as outline the reasons why Postgres can be considered the perfect companion in the database area.'
