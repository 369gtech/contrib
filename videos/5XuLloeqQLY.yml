description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2020 by Nicolas Telera, Octo.\n\nMore info: https://android-makers-2020.firebaseapp.com/schedule/?sessionId=165920\n\nEverybody knows about the Google Assistant. We probably all have already used it at least once if only to try it and some talks already answer quite a few questions about it very well.\r\n\r\nHowever, it seems to remain mysterious as for the scope of its field of action and implementation for us developers.\r\n\r\nFor instance, can you answer these questions:\r\n\r\n- Can you define what is an interaction with the Assistant?\r\n- What kind of interactions are available?\r\n- How do I build a simple interaction?\r\n- How do I build a more complex, conversation like interaction?\r\n- Can I build a complex visual response through the Assistant?\r\n- Can I ship an interaction to production?\r\n- Can I even build my own interactions?!\r\n\r\nIf you can't, come listen to me talk about the Google Assistant from an Android developer's perspective through actual code and demos."
