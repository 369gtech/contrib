I will take you beyond the slow query optimization and instead zero in on the performance impacts surrounding the quantity of your datastore hits. Using real world examples dealing with datastores such as Elasticsearch, MySQL, and Redis, I will demonstrate how many fast queries can wreak just as much havoc as a few big slow ones. With each example I will make use of the simple tools available in Ruby and Rails to decrease and eliminate the need for these fast and seemingly innocuous datastore hits."
