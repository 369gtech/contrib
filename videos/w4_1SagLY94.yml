description: "Watch this amazing talk about the new Elm-based library Style Elements! \n\nThe Style Elements library is a new set of primitives for working with layout and style in Elm. The most common goal when working with your view is usually to set or to adjust your layout. HTML and CSS make this difficult because there's no central place that represents your layout. You're generally forced to bounce back and forth between multiple definitions in multiple files in order to adjust layout, even though it's probably the most common thing you'll do. The Style Elements library makes layout a first class idea, which makes working with style and layout a breeze.\n\nEVENT: ReactiveConf 2017 (https://reactiveconf.com/)\n\nSPEAKER: Richard Feldman\n\nPERMISSIONS: The event organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nORIGINAL SOURCE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt1TzVngOqY"
