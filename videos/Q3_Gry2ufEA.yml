recordingDate: 1571056627
description: "The fully managed Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) makes deploying and managing containerized applications easy. It offers serverless Kubernetes, an integrated continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) experience, and enterprise-grade security and governance. To keep up with application demands in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), you may need to adjust the number of nodes that run your workloads. At the session we will look into cluster autoscaler and  virtual kubelet to adhere to application needs in seconds and run an efficient, cost efficient cluster with DevOps in mind.\n\nSession AKS Unlimited Scale:\n\nPresentation: http://data.azuredemos.net/files/AKS-Scale-DevOps-Riga-2019.pdf   \nCode: http://data.azuredemos.net/files/hello-keda.zip\nScript: http://data.azuredemos.net/files/AKS-Scale-DevOps-Riga-2019-script.txt"
