description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nServices in your Clusters are Way Costlier than they Appear!! - Yash Bhatnagar & Naina Verma, VMware \n\nA common myth in containerized infrastructures is that the containers running the \"micro\"-services are so small that just like their name, they only have a \"micro\" effect with any resource optimization effort, and are quite often considered not worth the time and effort.  Even though orchestrators might have options to support serverless functions in the form of k8s jobs, etc. these constructs remain underutilized, more so because of a lack of such mathematical proof and analysis  In this talk, the speakers will be showcasing a case study about how for just a single service, using ingredients like: 1 A cursory look at resource utilization values 2 High school statistics 3 Time series analysis  they were able to cook-up a quick revamp recipe into serverless functions & saved a lot ( Hint: around 4 digits) on their monthly infra costs and surprisingly, improving the peak load performance of several other unrelated services!  Interested in finding the actual numbers? See you at the talk! \n\nhttps://sched.co/aYqF"
