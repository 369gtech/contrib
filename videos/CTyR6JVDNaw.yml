description: "This talk of Fredrik Svahn was recorded at the Erlang User Conference 2012 in Stockholm. For more details and slides, take a look on the website: http://www.erlang-factory.com/conference/ErlangUserConference2012/speakers/FredrikSvahn\n\nExploring the joys of reverse engineering a modern super-optimized Erlang virtual machine like BEAM, this talk will give an insight into what it takes to get an Erlang system up and running in your browser.\n\nThe talk is based on experiences from the browserl project, an open source hobby project available on github.\n\nTalk objectives: Is it even possible to run an Erlang/OTP system in a browser? What are the main obstacles? What sort of performance can be expected? How much code does it take? Can I write my own Erlang emulator in $language? What is the status of the current development? Future plans?\n\nTarget audience: This talk targets attendants with an interest in running Erlang in e.g. a web browser. If you want to write an Erlang emulator on your own, or if you are interested in the internals of a lightweight Erlang emulator this talk is also for you."
