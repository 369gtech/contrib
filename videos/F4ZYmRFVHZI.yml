description: "Productionâ€¦ The place where all the magic happens. Because of this these environments are often locked down for developers. But does that really fit the current day and age where we use the cloud, DevOps and an agile way of working?\n\nTesting in production can give you a lot of benefits by having earlier feedback & faster releases, better quality and being more in control over your application.\n\nIn this session we will discuss why you should in production, what benefits it will give you but also give you practical examples of how to do this in practice. Join this session to make sure your users aren't the only people who are testing your application in production!"
