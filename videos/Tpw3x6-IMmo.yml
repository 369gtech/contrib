description: "Cloud Foundry’s New .NET Capabilities - William Martin & Shawn Neal, Pivotal\n\n.NET is undergoing a remarkable and unique transformation and is evolving at a rapid pace. As .NET continues to evolve, so too does Cloud Foundry to empower its cloud-native future.\n\nIn this session, William and Shawn will relate the new capabilities that the Garden Windows and BOSH Windows teams have built to deliver a first-class experience for .NET on Cloud Foundry and why they make CF the premier enterprise platform for cloud-native, modernized, and legacy .NET workloads.\n\nWilliam and Shawn will review the history of the product, the basics of deploying the new containerized Windows stack on CF, what happens to a .NET application when it is pushed to the Application Runtime, how to inspect it, and finally, what Windows Server Containers mean for .NET developers, enterprises, and the future of Cloud Foundry’s .NET and Windows capabilities, including Container Runtime.\n\nAbout Shawn Neal\nShawn started out in the video game industry over 20 years ago but found developing scalable architectures and teams to be far more fun. Today he's a Windows practice lead at Pivotal and is equally comfortable working with platform operators and developers. Prior to joining Pivotal Shawn became a Vagrant contributor and added Windows guest support to Vagrant and Packer. When he's not working with tech, he likes to spend his time riding motorcycles, volunteering, watching football, and discovering good beer.\n\nAbout William Martin\nWilliam Martin is Pivotal product lead for Microsoft, .NET, and Windows and Cloud Foundry Foundation project lead for the Garden Windows and BOSH Windows teams. He drives the product vision, roadmap, and strategy for Pivotal Application Service for Windows and .NET capabilities for other related platform products. He has served in the past as Head of Product for real estate visualization startup Floored, software engineer at big data startup Ufora, instructor at General Assembly, and professor of architecture at NYIT and the Yale School of Architecture. He’s spoken at SpringOne Platform, Yale School of Management, The Product Group Meetup, True University (True Ventures), and Design Driven NYC (Firstmark Capital).\n\nhttps://www.cloudfoundry.org/"
