description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2013\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nOrta Therox - Lead iOS Developer at Artsy\n\nABSTRACT\nObjective-C as a language has been around since the 80s but there's never been a way to share dependencies in the language till the end of 2011. CocoaPods takes inspiration from modern package managers like homebrew and rubygems to create a tool that fits perfectly into the workflow of anyone making Mac / iOS apps.\n\nOrta will take you on guided tour going through what CocoaPods is, how it came to be, what our plans are in the future and how CocoaPods will save you time and how you can help save others time.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
