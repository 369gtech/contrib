description: "Software often lasts longer than expected. Software is also changing more often than expected. At some point, there comes a moment where a developer looks at the code and asks:\n\n“How is this piece of code supposed to work?”\nA look into the git history is also not very helpful with messages like \"fixed some bugs\".\nThis session will show some tips on how to create a comprehensible git history and what the benefits are.\n\nAfter this session, participants will know what to look for in their daily work with Git, and how they should use Git, so that changes to the code are still comprehensible months or years later.\n\nRoland Weisleder is a software engineer and architect working at data experts in Berlin. His focus is on creating and maintaining long-living enterprise applications in the Java ecosystem. As head of the company's technology board, he also advises the individual project teams on current technologies, techniques and trends."
