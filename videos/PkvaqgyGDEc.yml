description: "Based on recent work on the B::C module, it's now possible to build a working binary which can do away with the majority of startup expense a typical perl program would have. \n\nIn this talk, I'll explain:\n- What the perlcc compiler does and doesn't do.\n- How to setup the perl compiler.\n- How to pre-compile a perl script into a binary for faster execution.\n- Discuss the common mistakes one makes when building a perl binary and how to work around them."
