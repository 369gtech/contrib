description: "Animations make your app visually appealing, easier to use, and more engaging.\n\nAnimations however are not limited to only traditional Xamarin development; you can add beautiful animations to Xamarin.Forms.\n\nIn this session, you will learn the core concepts of when to use animations in a mobile app and explore several different frameworks used to create them.\n\nWhen to properly use animations to provide visual feedback, supply context around UI elements, and call attention to app status changes will be explored. Then you’ll learn how to make your app come to life using the built-in Xamarin.Forms animation APIs, SkiaSharp, and the new Lottie animation framework from Airbnb.\n\nAfter this session, you’ll be equipped to create Xamarin.Forms apps that will stand out with animations."
