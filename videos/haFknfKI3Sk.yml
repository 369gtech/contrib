description: "Lightweight Preemptible Functions\n\nSol Boucher, Carnegie Mellon University; Anuj Kalia, Microsoft Research; David G. Andersen, Carnegie Mellon University; Michael Kaminsky, BrdgAI / Carnegie Mellon University\n\nLamenting the lack of a natural userland abstraction for preemptive interruption and asynchronous cancellation, we propose lightweight preemptible functions, a mechanism for synchronously performing a function call with a precise timeout that is lightweight, efficient, and composable, all while being portable between programming languages. We present the design of libinger, a library that provides this abstraction, on top of which we build libturquoise, arguably the first general-purpose and backwards-compatible preemptive thread library implemented entirely in userland. Finally, we demonstrate this software stackâ€™s applicability to and performance on the problems of combatting head-of-line blocking and time-based DoS attacks.\n\nView the full USENIX ATC '20 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc20/technical-sessions"
