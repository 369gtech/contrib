description: "Keynote: Anthropic Sympathy - How Cloud Foundry & Continuous Delivery Make Humans Happier and More Productive - Daniel Jones, CTO, EngineerBetter\n\nCloud Foundry and Continuous Delivery make it possible to exploit the findings of cognitive psychology and neuroscience to increase the productivity and happiness of our teams.\n\nThis session will answer: \n• How can we improve willpower & decrease technical debt? \n• Is the present bias real? How can we turn it to our advantage? \n• Can you increase a team’s effective IQ? \n• How do DevOps & Product Teams increase empathy, and what impact does empathy have on productivity? \n• Why is Cloud Foundry vital to all of this?\n\n“Mechanical sympathy” was popularized in software development when LMAX inverted the practice of writing software in a style that befitted humans, and instead wrote code that exploited characteristics of the hardware it ran upon. This talk makes the argument that our processes are software, our teams the platform, and our brains the hardware (wetware!) that runs it.\n\nAbout Daniel Jones\nDaniel Jones is CTO of UK Cloud Foundry consultancy EngineerBetter. He has recently been operating and supporting multiple production CF instances at a global wealth management enterprise, and helping an IoT tech startup build their platform atop CF. Daniel was a member of the Pivotal CF London Services team, and also worked with Europe's leading CF consultancy CloudCredo. Daniel has spoken at CF Summit Santa Clara 2016, CF Summit Berlin 2015 and the London PaaS User Group, as well as numerous video games industry conferences. He once even stormed the stage at a music festival to interrupt the performing act and challenge their questionable off-stage conduct!"
