description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nProgressive Delivery Techniques with Flagger - Stefan Prodan, Weaveworks \n\nYou might have heard about progressive delivery - it’s an umbrella term for various deployment techniques (eg. Canary releases, Dark launches, A/B testing, Blue-Green mirroring) meant to reduce the risk of introducing new software versions in production. In this session, Stefan will talk about what it takes to adopt progressive delivery for Kubernetes and how Flagger and service meshes can make deployments safer by limiting the impact of a failed release. We will look at different progressive delivery techniques, discuss the pros and cons, suggest what type of applications are best suited for each technique, and review added complexities that come with each option. We’ll close with a live demo of a GitOps pipeline powered by Flux, Flagger, and Linkerd to showcase the deployment techniques presented. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ekBD"
