recordingDate: 1612093912
description: "Toby Bellwood\n\nhttps://lca2021.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/47/\n\nAs a commercial business, amazee.io has been providing Drupal hosting since 2010.  In August 2017, amazee.io open-sourced the latest iteration of their hosting platform, Lagoon, and entered a new realm of collaboration with their customers and users.  From his unique perspective and journey from a customer to Product Lead, Toby will present an overview of Lagoon's development over the last three years of growth.  In this talk, he'll uncover what it means to balance open-source with commercial interest, how contributions are a two-way street, and how to form deep, lasting partnerships with your users.  Showing examples where customer and partner collaborations have led development alongside internal developer-driven innovations will hopefully help to illuminate some of the benefits that working in the Open can provide all parties.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
