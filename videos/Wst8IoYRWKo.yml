title: '"FPGA Design with Chisel" - Josh Bassett (LCA 2021 Online)'
recordingDate: 1612102055
description: "Josh Bassett\n\nhttps://lca2021.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/33/\n\nHardware description languages, like Verilog and VHDL, have been used since the early 1980s to describe all types of digital circuts: everything from simple logic devices to modern microprocessors.\r\n\r\nWhile these languages are still widely considered to be industry-standard, their tooling and ergonomics have fallen far behind modern software development best-practices. \r\n\r\nChisel is an open-source digital design tool that leverages the Scala programming language, providing designers with the power of a modern programming language to describe complex digital circuits. Importantly, it also enables the use of many modern software engineering practices (e.g unit testing, static analysis, CI, etc.).\r\n\r\nChisel is not a toy â€” it was most notably used by the Chips Alliance (Linux Foundation) to implement the open-source Rocket Chip RISC-V processor core (https://github.com/chipsalliance/rocket-chip). It was also used by Google to develop the edge tensor processing unit ASIC (https://cloud.google.com/edge-tpu).\r\n\r\nThis talk aims to give an introduction to Chisel, and showcase how it can be used to create digital designs that are expressive, well-tested, and maintainable.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
