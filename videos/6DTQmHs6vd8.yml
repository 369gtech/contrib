description: "Brian Vermeer, Software Engineer, Blue4IT\n\nIn Java 8, functional-style programming was introduced to Java. Java 9 extended this with some nice new features. Many people find it hard to grasp the idea of functional-style programming after so many years of working purely in the imperative OOP style. The opportunities Java gives us out of the box are massive, but with great power comes great responsibility. This presentation points out common mistakes in integrating functional-style programming into your everyday Java project and how to prevent them. This way you can write better, cleaner, and more readable code. But even more important, you will be able to utilize functional code construction in Java 9 to its full potential—and maybe you’ll even start to like it."
