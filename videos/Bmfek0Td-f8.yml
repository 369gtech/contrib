title: 'Spark Structured Streaming for Machine Learning w/ Holden Karau & Seth Hendrickson (IBM) StrataNY'
recordingDate: 1479841089
description: "Streaming machine learning is being integrated in future versions of Spark, but you don’t need to wait. Holden Karau and Seth Hendrickson demonstrate how to do streaming machine learning using Spark’s new Structured Streaming and walk you through creating your own streaming model. Holden and Seth will also cover how to use structured machine-learning algorithms (if they are merged by the talk). By the end of this session, you’ll have a better understanding of Spark’s Structured Streaming API as well as how machine learning works in Spark.\n\nSee the companion blog post at https://www.oreilly.com/learning/extend-structured-streaming-for-spark-ml & slides at http://www.slideshare.net/hkarau/apache-spark-structured-streaming-for-machine-learning-strataconf-2016 for more information."
