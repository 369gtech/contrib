He also discusses his work on new ECMAScript features and how you can start using them to write compact, idiomatic Javascript in production. Lastly, Thomas discusses the work the V8 team has done for the Node community and the new improvements that it has provided. \n\nCheck out the rest of the Chrome Dev Summit videos here: https://goo.gl/ekCoVu                \nSubscribe to the Google Chrome Developers channel: http://goo.gl/LLLNvf"
