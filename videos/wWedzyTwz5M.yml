description: 'Microservices are an accepted paradigm for backend software systems and show undeniable benefits. However, web applications - especially Single Page Applications - are often developed and deployed as a monolith bearing challenges regarding extensibility and maintainability. This session illustrates practicable patterns for modular web applications from development to deployment. Topics covered will briefly focus on recent evolutions enabling modular web applications and how an split up application can be efficiently served to a browsers. Therefore, the talk will also make brief references to current frameworks to extract their patterns dealing with reusability and compressibility while also pointing out how underlying developments in web standards help lay foundations to fight commonly faced issues.
