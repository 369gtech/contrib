description: "Andrew Bartlett\nhttp://linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/113/\nSamba4 (our Samba AD DC) is increasingly widly used and is becoming used at scale, and this talk will detail Samba's journey from 'wow, it works' to 'can we have 100,000 users please'. \r\n\r\nSamba 4.5 brings significant improvement in our scale, to around 30,000 users, and this talk will look at how we got there, share some war stories along the way, and what we are doing to bring us up to the 100,000 size."
