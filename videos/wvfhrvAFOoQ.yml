Beginners tend to overuse features such as pattern matching and multiple function heads because of their novelty, while missing opportunities to make their code more generic and workable. Additionally, powerful language features such as protocols and behaviours are often overlooked due to their relative complexity.\n\nThis talk will highlight many of the common beginner mistakes and often alternative patterns to writing code that tend to be more maintainable over time.\n\nRead the full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/david-lucia/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - DAVID LUCIA\nDave started as a C++ developer but has refactored himself into a passionate Elixir dev. He is proud of building https://theoutline.com, as well as rebuilding Bloomberg.com in 2014\n\nDave is currently using Elixir and Rust to build high load, real-time sports betting software at SimpleBet. Before that, Dave spent two and a half years at The Outline, where he built its custom CMS and advertising platform in Elixir and Phoenix. Prior to that, he worked for Bloomberg where he was an integral part of the 2014 Bloomberg.com relaunch.\n\nDave lives in Queens, NY with his wife and 6lb pomeranian named Pearl.\n\nMore on David Lucia: https://codesync.global/speaker/david-lucia/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM SF 19\nCode BEAM SF is powered by Code Sync.
