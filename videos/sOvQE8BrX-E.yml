title: 'Extending Cloud Foundry with Custom Integration'
recordingDate: 1399414872
description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2013 in Santa Clara, CA.\nSpeakers: Cornelia Davis, Scott Frederick\nAs you find it in the open-source codebase, Cloud Foundry includes a set of prepackaged services (Postgres, MySQL, Redis, MongoDB and RabbitMQ) and a number of application runtimes (Java, Ruby and Node.js). In addition, CloudFoundry.com integrates with a number of external service providers through a services gateway. When you are deploying your own Cloud Foundry you can extend the existing open-source features by adding additional services and runtime support. In fact, you can bring your own runtime to any Cloud Foundry (including CloudFoundry.com) via buildpacks. In this session we will show you how to build and deploy, or broker custom services. We will also introduce you to buildpacks, show you how to create your own, and how to get your apps to use them.\n\nLearn more about using CloudFoundry at:\nhttp://www.cloudfoundry.com/use"
