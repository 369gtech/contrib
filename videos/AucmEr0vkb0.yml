description: "The full title of the presentation is \"More than Smart Toasters: How Companies Are Using the Internet of Things to Fight Climate Change\"\n\nPeter Thiel once said, “We wanted flying cars. Instead, we got 140 characters.” \n\nWe need to be applying our best technology to our most significant problems. And today, some of our biggest problems are resource scarcity and climate change. \n\nAs our population grows to 9.8 billion people by 2050, we will continue to strain the planet’s resources to produce enough electricity, food, and water. At the same time, consuming all these additional resources will cause more climate change, pollution and waste management problems. For us to survive, we need companies to create innovative and profitable solutions for better managing our scarce resources.\n\nIn this talk, Daniel will share inspiring examples of companies leveraging the Internet of things to address complex challenges in the energy, food, and water industries. These solutions combine cutting edge technology such as smart sensors, edge computing, the cloud, and artificial intelligence.\n\nThe speech took place on 9th May 2019 on Inspire Stage during Infoshare 2019."
