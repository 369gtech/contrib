description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nIntroducing KFServing: Serverless Model Serving on Kubernetes - Ellis Bigelow, Google & Dan Sun, Bloomberg \n\nProduction-grade serving of ML models is a challenging task for data scientists. In this talk, we'll discuss how KFServing powers some real-world examples of inference in production at Bloomberg, which supports the business domains of NLP, computer vision, and time-series analysis. KFServing (https://github.com/kubeflow/kfserving) provides a Kubernetes CRD for serving ML models on arbitrary frameworks. It aims to solve 80% of model serving use cases by providing performant, high abstraction interfaces for common ML frameworks. It provides a consistent and richly featured abstraction that supports bleeding-edge serving features like CPU/GPU auto-scaling, scale to and from 0, and canary rollouts. KFServing's charter includes a rich roadmap to fulfill a complete story for mission critical ML, including inference graphs, model explainability, outlier detection, and payload logging. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UaZo"
