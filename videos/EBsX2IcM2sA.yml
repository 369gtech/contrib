language: English
recordingDate: 1447405790
description: 'When facing a technical migration of its application server infrastructure, Smals reviewed its business needs and ended up with Platform as a Service. We quickly saw that setting up a PaaS cannot be done by your Operations department alone. When you add the forces of Development, everybody wins. Now one year further, we can share with you some of the lessons learned and tell you how this became part of a bigger movement into a Belgian Government cloud.'
