description: "Functional Programming is becoming increasingly popular and relevant with each year that goes by. With so much discussion around languages such as F#, Haskell and Erlang, it can seem as though getting started with Functional programming would mean first learning a whole new syntax...but what if it didn't?\nUsing just a few JavaScript libraries, such as RamdaJS, developers can implement some of the most powerful patterns and techniques from the world of functional programming?\nThis talk will demonstrate how, using ES6 and a few extra libraries, we can write Functional code that is:\n\n- More robust\n- Easier to read\n - Easier to maintain\n\nThis talk might be of interest to anyone looking into moving to a new platform, or in improving the scalability of an existing application, or even just interested in seeing what Functional Programming is all about, but all within the comfort of a familiar language.\n\nWe might even attempt the impossible, and explain what a Monad is! \n\nEVENT:\nFOSS-North 2020\n\nSPEAKER:\nSimon Painter\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed)\n\nATTRIBUTION CREDITS:\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLSNxtFPVlg"
