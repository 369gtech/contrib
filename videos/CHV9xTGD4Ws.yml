description: "We're working to make every smartphone a Magic Window into the world. See how a sofa looks in your living room. Know which exit to take when you get off the subway. Play with a virtual cat that jumps on your lap. With a few extra sensors and some software magic, your device understands the world the same way you do. Eitan Marder-Eppstein discusses the technology behind these applications and how to take advantage of it.\n\nWatch more talks from Ubiquity Dev Summit here: https://goo.gl/FS9v3U\n\nSubscribe to the Google Developers channel at http://goo.gl/mQyv5L\n\nMusic by Terra Monk: http://terramonk.com/"
