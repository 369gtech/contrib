recordingDate: 1526549927
description: "Oleg Selajev\n\nGraalVM is an embeddable virtual machine created for running all languages efficiently, from Java and Kotlin, to JavaScript, C and Swift and so on. It uses the existing JVM architecture to ensure the best peak performance for long-running apps but also can run programs compiled ahead-of-time for better startup time and lower runtime overhead. One can embed GraalVM in their app creating secure execution sandboxes for polyglot applications. This way GraalVM can be run in the Oracle RDBMS and MySQL databases with zero overhead for accessing the database. All in all it allows you to run any language and libraries from all ecosystems wherever you want! From this talk, you'll learn key use cases of GraalVM for Java and JavaScript developers."
