title: 'Vue & Vuex: Structure Your App With Centralized State Management'
language: English
recordingDate: 1551375001
description: "Vue.js is the latest major SPA framework that has grown in popularity immensely, becoming a legitimate competitor to React and Angular. In part, this is because it combines—according to many—the best of both worlds. Simplicity is another key characteristic of Vue.js, manifesting itself not only in its excellent documentation and the possibility to start off with a simple script tag but also through the superb Vue-CLI that helps you structure and scale your projects. Apart from the fundamentals of the framework, such as components, directives, routing, and testing, we will dive into centralised state management in the form of Vuex.\n\nEVENT:\n\nØredev 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nChristoffer Noring\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nØredev Conference Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video."
