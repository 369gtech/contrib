description: "Sergio Rodrigo implements the Bowling Game kata in Kotlin using TDD, showing some of the features of the language, such as support for Functional Programming (Higher Order Functions, Lambdas and built-in functions), Pattern Matching, Extension Functions, Expression Bodies, and method names as free text. The kata is performed in a way that shows the expressiveness of Kotlin.\n\nThe Kotlin plugin for IntelliJ is used to show the IDE support for the language, using live templates and performing small automatic refactorings.\n\nThe code used in this video can be found on GitHub at https://github.com/codurance/bowling_game_kata"
