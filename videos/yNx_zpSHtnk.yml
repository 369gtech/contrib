title: 'Building modular applications with JPMS and Layrry - Andres Almiray (Jfokus Brown Bag series)'
recordingDate: 1632768992
description: "The Java Module System lays the foundation for building modularized applications on the JVM. It doesn't concern itself though with resolving module versions and obtaining modules from repositories. This is where Layrry comes in: an API and launcher for modularized Java applications which takes a descriptor of the module layer(s) to assemble, fetches the modules and starts up the application.\n\nRecorded Tuesday 13 October 2020 kl. 12:00"
