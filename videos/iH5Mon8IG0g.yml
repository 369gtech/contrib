language: English
recordingDate: 1490922284
description: "Most Clojurians can come to consensus on two things:\n– Clojure is a great language for scalable data processing.\n– Mainstream Clojure adoption is difficult.\n\nThis talk introduces Pyroclast, a commercial distributed data processing tool built on top of Onyx, and describes its architecture. Pyroclast is built to make Clojurians feel at home when the parens need to be left behind – demo abound!\n\nMichael is the co-founder and CEO of Distributed Masonry. In 2013, Michael began work on the Onyx platform – a scalable, high performance, distributed data processing platform for Clojure. He spends his days growing and maintaining the platform for the open source community. He spends his nights sleeping."
