title: 'An in-flight port from Angular to React, a tale of performance and happiness - Christiansen & Paulin'
recordingDate: 1567511580
description: "A real-world story of how we used some clever trickery to completely rewrite an app, bit by bit from Angular to React, resulting in better performance, a smaller footprint, a shorter feedback loop, less coupling, fewer bugs, increased development velocity and happier developers.\n\nWe did the re-write, while deploying to production frequently. New features were added to the product throughout the whole rewrite process, and stability was maintained throughout the entire process.\n\nThe application is an e-commerce payment solution (Nets Easy), used by numerous merchants in their web shops to get paid.\n\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks in the following links!\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcoslo.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
