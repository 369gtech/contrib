description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nNext Generation of CI/CD: Analytics-driven Traffic Management on Kubernetes - Fabio Oliveira, IBM \n\nWe will describe and demonstrate how to architect a CI/CD solution to upgrade Kubernetes services while relying on fully automatic traffic management driven by principled metric and success criteria analysis. Our solution relies on Istio’s support for traffic management and on iter8 (https://iter8.tools), a new open-source Kubernetes controller and analytics engine. Iter8 automatically shifts user traffic to a canary version as it becomes increasingly confident in the canary’s performance and correctness, and it rolls back to the current version if things go bad. By way of example, we will show how IBM Watson Health migrated to our proposed solution and the lessons learned in the process.\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zep8"
