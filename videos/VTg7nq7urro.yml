description: "Video recording of a presentation given at JDK IO conference in Copenhagen in June 2018 at the IT-University organized by the Danish Java User Group - Javagruppen.\n\nhttps://jdk.io/jdk-io-2018/speakers/226-kamil-szymanski\n\nNailing down bugs in distributed systems\n\nSpeaker: Kamil Szymański\n\nFinding bugs in distributed systems is challenging.\n\nFinding bugs on production in distributed systems is even harder due to time pressure, especially if the bug is on critical path.\n\nAt times like that you can't afford guessing what's wrong, you have to take decisions based on real data.\n\nIn this slides-free session we will see how can we use live data for making bugs discovery quicker and finding root causes of such bugs easier.\n\nMoreover we will discuss how to deal with production outages and quickly recover from them."
