description: "Of Mice & Elephants\n\nKoon Seng Lim and Sandeep Hooda, DBS\n\nJust as in the well-known myth that the mighty elephant cowers before the tiny mouse; the presence of small files in the Hadoop Distributed File System can literally bring the elephant of big data to its knees! In this talk, we chronicle our journey of managing small files after an unfortunate incident rendered our multi-petabyte cluster inactive for close to 5 days. The aftermath of the incident spawned a flurry of collaborative work between our infrastructure SRE, enterprise SRE, platform SRE and application teams. We discuss the various lessons learned and experience gained from experimenting with and implementing various mitigating measures in the domain of people, process, and technology to combat the scourge of small files; a perennial problem in Hadoop. We show that with the proper mitigating controls and technical capabilities afforded by newer distributed file systems, mice and elephants can coexist happily, just as in real life.\n\nView the full SREcon21 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon21/program"
