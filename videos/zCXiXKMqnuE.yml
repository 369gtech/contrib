description: "The Kubernetes Control Plane for Busy People Who Like Pictures - Daniel Smith, Google \n\nLet’s dive into the modular design of the Kubernetes control plane together. We’ll talk about the specific resources and controllers which make Kubernetes what it is, and how this pattern generalizes--which problem domains are well solved by the Kubernetes control plane architecture? This talk will speak to people ready for a 201-level introduction to the Kubernetes control plane, and also to people contemplating using Kubernetes API Machinery for their own purposes. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPa5"
