title: 'A Practical Guide to Compliance with the GNU GPL'
recordingDate: 1484965397
description: "Bradley M. Kuhn, Karen M. Sandler\nhttp://linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/17/\nCo-presented by an instructor who has done more GPL compliance work (and taught more courses on it) than anyone, and one of the most experienced lawyers in FOSS licensing, this tutorial, teaches the practical details that developers, business managers and lawyers must know to ensure their company's proper compliance with the GNU GPL and related licenses.\r\nThe tutorial first explains the key provisions of GPL for those who wish to redistribute modified versions of GPL software, including handling binaries found in consumer devices.  Thereafter, the tutorial explains in plain and straightforward langauge the most challenging concept in GPL: complete, corresponding source code (CCS), its preparation, and its procurement.\r\n\r\nFinally, the tutorial explains what companies can expect if, despite their best efforts, they fail to comply with GPL, and furthermore outlines the necessary remedies to receive restoration of GPL's permissions.\r\n\r\nBoth the written and spoken portions of this tutorial have been carefully honed and crafted over a decade to yield material that is useful to all three constituencies interested in GPL compliance: developers, business managers, and lawyers.  All three groups will learn important information that relates to their role in the process of effective GPL compliance.\r\n\r\nThis tutorial does not provide rote procedures for compliance; rather, the tutorial focuses on the policy goals that GPL seeks to achieve, and helps developers, lawyers and managers understand how to design processes that both fit their own work-flow and focus on the oft-ignored but most important aspects of the GPL.\r\n\r\nAttendees should already know the very basic concepts of Open Source and Free Software licensing, but the tutorial should be accessible to anyone who has spent at least some time in the Open Source industry."
