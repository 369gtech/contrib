description: "How Did Our Garden Grow? Advances in the Cloud Foundry App Runtime's Container Engine - Giuseppe Capizzi, Pivotal & Yulia Nedyalkova, SAP\n\nGarden (the Cloud Foundry App Runtime's container engine, optimised for PaaS workloads) saw awesome features bloom over the last year. This talk will help operators understand and leverage new security features such as rootless, and will introduce developers to the new and long-requested CPU Entitlements feature.\n\nGarden is the first production runtime to support rootless mode; a wonderful security benefit. Leveraging containerd, Garden now uses more industry standards than ever, allowing for a much more familiar operator experience. New container CPU metrics enable operators and tooling to make better decisions about scaling; the speakers will demonstate concrete decision making based on reliable, consistent CPU metrics.\n\nAbout Giuseppe Capizzi\nGiuseppe is a Software Engineer at Pivotal. He has been working on Cloud Foundry for two years, first on the Platform Recovery team and now on Garden, CloudFoundryâ€™s container runtime. Previously, he helped enterprises build awesome products with Pivotal Labs. In his spare time he enjoys turning flour, water salt and yeast into delicious bread (with sometimes questionable results).\n\nAbout Yulia Nedyalkova\nYulia Nedyalkova is a software developer at SAP currently contributing to the Garden project. Before joining the Garden team, she worked on the integration and operation of different projects in the SAP Cloud Platform, including Abacus and ELK.\n\nhttps://www.cloudfoundry.org/"
