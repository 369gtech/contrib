description: 'In Agile, we value “working software over comprehensive documentation” - there is value in documentation, but we value working software more. This helps us get things done and avoid waste. However, extremes are very common: teams who avoid documentation altogether (“our code is self-documenting”), or teams who create way too much documentation. This talk will cover how to leverage documentation to improve team documentation, align everybody to a common vision, as well as underutilised forms of documentation that go beyond drawing the current system state.'
