recordingDate: 1593111623
description: "As the adoption of Kubernetes is increasing it is common to see multiple clusters being managed by organizations. Managing multiple clusters, their access to teams, and enabling information securely is important.\n\nBotKube ( https://github.com/infracloudio/botkube ) is a lightweight, configurable and pluggable app for “chatting” with multiple Kubernetes clusters and monitoring events. Today it supports Slack, Mattermost, Elastic, and support for Microsoft Teams, Discord, and Telegram is coming soon.\n\nIn this webinar, we will show a demo of various use cases and ways of enabling your teams and operations efforts with BotKube.\n\nPresenters:\n\nPrasad Ghangal, Creator of BotKube and Software geek @InfraCloud\nVishal Biyani, CTO @InfraCloud\nHrishikesh Deodhar, Director of Engineering @InfraCloud"
