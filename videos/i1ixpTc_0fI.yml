description: "Kevin Galligan\nPresident, Touchlab\n\nMOBILE ORIENTED ARCHITECTURE\nMost \"Cross-Platform\" is coming from the web, with web ideas and solutions. The future we should build is one where the technology moves in the other direction. The web inherits mobile architecture, and everything below the UI is shared. This will be a discussion of existing and emerging tech. What we can expect, and what needs to be built. The talk will be roughly based on this blog post: https://medium.com/@kpgalligan/mobile-oriented-architecture-moa-1fd113ff05fd. Shared Android and iOS architecture, along with WebAssembly, will power the next decade of development, with a focus on Kotlin multiplatform at the delivery technology."
