description: "Join our Meetup group at https://www.meetup.com/erlangusergroup\n\nJuan Facorro joined the Virtual BEAM Meetup GMT to introduce us to Clojerl, a Clojure implementation running on the BEAM.\n\nAbstract\nClojerl (Clojure implemented on the BEAM) provides powerful constructs and abstractions capabilities. Protocols and multimethods give you full control on how to organize your abstractions. Macros give you the power to create new language constructs. Data manipulation functions work on most data structures (e.g. maps, vectors, lists, sets) given they all implement common abstractions (i.e. protocols). That all sounds very nice, but how do you build applications with it? In this talk we share how you can create applications (or scripts) using this wonderful language, both by creating a project from scratch and through existing projects.\n\nBio\nAfter working with object-oriented languages for years, Juan entered the functional programming world working on personal projects in Common Lisp and Clojure. That’s when he knew he had found something great. While at Inaka he discovered Erlang and coding at work became a joy again. As a Klarna software engineer, he’s been building and improving highly available systems both in Erlang and not-Erlang (although mostly Erlang) and enjoying the beautiful Swedish summers. Whilst at Inaka (the most awesome company he worked for in Buenos Aires) he started learning and building systems in Erlang. He is now living in Stockholm with his wife, working for Klarna building and maintaining Erlang applications."
