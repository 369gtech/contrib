description: "Everyday we hear more and more about businesses in the \"big data\" space, but how many of us really understand how to build an engineering team driven by data? In this session I'll explore my experience building a data driven engineering team from the ground up. I'll walk through how a small team at Intent Media transitioned to using hundreds of terabytes of data a day to do real-time decisioning, dive deep on some of the tough technical issues that we faced, and discuss some of the problems that we're still dealing with, as well as some plans for the future. \n\nMost importantly, I'll show how data now drives almost everything we do, and how we're a more focused and productive team because of it.\n\nKurt was a team lead at Thoughtworks and helped build engineering teams at several start-ups, including Collaborative Drug Discovery, Triggit, and Ten Ton Labs, where he was a co-founder. He has more than 15 years of experience building scalable distributed systems and high-performance engineering teams. Kurt holds a BSE from the University of Michigan.\n\nFor more on YOW!
