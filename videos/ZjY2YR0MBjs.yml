description: "Google TechTalks\nJune 29, 2006\n\nGeorge Wolberg\nhttp://www-cs.engr.ccny.cuny.edu/~wolberg/\n\nABSTRACT\nThe photorealistic modeling of large-scale scenes, such as urban structures, requires a fusion of range sensing technology and traditional digital photography. In this talk, we describe a system that integrates multiview geometry and automated 3D registration techniques for texture mapping 2D images onto 3D range data. The 3D range scans and the 2D photographs are respectively used to generate a pair of 3D models of the scene. The first model consists of a dense 3D point cloud, produced by using a 3D-to-3D registration method that matches 3D lines in the range images. The second model consists of a..."
