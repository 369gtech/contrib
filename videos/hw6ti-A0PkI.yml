title: 'Facebook Flux Architecture with AngularJS'
language: English
recordingDate: 1424188801
description: "An overview of the Flux application architecture - an exciting new twist on a staid old approach to managing complexity in large GUI applications. We’ll then show how we apply it to AngularJS using Song Flux - a library that was written by David and Gabo for using Flux in Angular. No Angular experience needed - this presentation will show you everything you'd want to see on how these technologies can simplify large application codebases. \n\nGabriel “Gabo” Obregon (@gah_boh) is a developer focusing on web and iOS technologies. David Souther (@david_souther) is a developer focusing on web and server technologies. Both think software should be easier to build, but know building easier software just makes the abstractions break more. \n\nSlides available at https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Q_3hMqctlFVXuW3VoNuot_DLlk1A8HPaDgSdc6UZMHY/edit?usp=sharing\n\nPresented at Code & Supply in Pittsburgh, PA.
