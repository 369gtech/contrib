description: "In this video we will review the new experience of creating Build and Release (CI and CD) pipelines using YAML files in Azure DevOps. We will show how the YAML file is automatically generated based on the analysis of your Git repository. Finally, we will demonstrate the process of reviewing the code changes that went into your release, build and release logs and other details of your deployment jobs.\_URL: https://azure.com/pipelines\nDocumentation: https://aka.ms/YAMLpipelines"
