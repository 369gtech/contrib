It is popular for its flexible routing topologies, high scale throughput and support for multiple messaging protocols. This talk presents RabbitMQ on Kubernetes. It gives an introduction to the RabbitMQ Cluster Operator on how to reliably operate RabbitMQ clusters. It provides best practices about monitoring and upgrading RabbitMQ while millions of messages flow through the broker. The presentation covers the Messaging Topology Operator and its use cases to declaratively deploy RabbitMQ resources such as queues, exchanges, and bindings. The session ends with an update of newly released RabbitMQ features and an outlook of what the community can expect of RabbitMQ on Kubernetes in 2022."
