title: 'YOW! Nights May 2017 Bodil Stokke - You Have Nothing to Lose But Your Chains'
recordingDate: 1495868809
description: "This is a talk about the Open Source movement and the Free Software movement it grew out of, about its disregarded heroes and its flawed prophets, about what it’s doing for us and what it’s doing to us. I’d like to examine how it empowers us, and how it exploits us, and to show you why it’s really, really important that we figure out a way to make sure nobody can ever take it from us.\n\nBorn into an aristocratic Russian-German family, Bodil traveled widely around the Soviet Union as a child. Largely self-educated, she developed an interest in computer science during her teenage years. According to her later claims, in 1989 she embarked on a series of world travels, visiting Europe, the Americas, and India. She alleged that during this period she encountered a group of mathematical adepts, the “Haskell Language and Library Committee,” who sent her to Glasgow, Scotland, where they trained her to develop her powers of category theory. Both contemporary critics and later biographers have argued that some or all of these foreign visits were fictitious, and that she spent this period writing JavaScript.\n\nBodil was a controversial figure during her lifetime, championed by supporters as an enlightened guru and derided as a fraudulent charlatan by critics. Her doctrines influenced the spread of Homotopy Type Theory in the West as well as the development of Western computer science currents like dependent types, blockchains and isomorphic JavaScript.\n\nFor more on YOW!
