title: 'Hot Garbage: Clean Code Is Dead'
language: English
recordingDate: 1541102806
description: "The Code is rising up to enslave us. An army of linter-plugins have given it a voice and it's angry. Clean code isn't the goal, its the enemy. Great code isn't clean, it's hot garbageâ€”hot-swappable and easy to throw out. Code is a means to an end. When we stop fetishizing code and start fighting it, we've found the right enemy and we can get back to to the good work of serving customers.\n\nEVENT:\n\nNEJS CONF 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nMichael Chan\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ri10aE-Idc&t=172s"
