description: "Google Tech Talk (more info below)\r\nJune 1, 2011\r\n\r\nPresented by Scott Davidoff, Ph.D.\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nThis talk describes how my work with busy families:\r\n(1) identifies how their coordination breaks down (from 3 years of fieldwork and experience prototyping)\r\n(2) Identifies how we can apply unsupervised machine learning to this problem context (using mobile phone GPS)\r\n(3) Creates a new way to visualize the calendar that combines manually input and learned information"
