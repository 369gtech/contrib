description: 'Over the years Go compiler become smarter and standard library become faster, yet sometimes one still needs to fix a bottleneck, to resolve a locking problem and understand garbage collector pauses. My talk is about all this. We will learn to write proper benchmarks, use pprof and execution tracer, will look into runtime debug information and will touch a Linux performance tools. I will also mention a few of Go compiler optimizations and how not to accidentally disable them.'
