description: "An overview of the challenges and possibilities that a large company can face when implementing an agile way of working.\n\nSome short info on SEB with focus on the changing landscape for the banking industry that are becoming increasingly evident and will lead to a need for radical changes in business- and IT development. The need for speed and innovative mindset is becoming much more crucial and as a consequence a need for another way of working. How are we in SEB working with this and some insights from the work so far.\n\nWhich are the main challenges when you go for a more agile and innovative thinking when you have a long history and also a legacy to relate to? The size of the company is also a challenge in itself and I will try to talk a bit on how we, so far, have thought about these challenges and how we are handling them."
