description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nThe Open Source Revolution: How Kubernetes is Changing the Games Industry - Dominic Green, Netspeak Games \n\nTraditional multiplayer game development involves dozens if not hundreds of engineers over several years building custom made backends - often from scratch. Companies have recently moved to GCP or AWS but most games infrastructure runs on metal - often using multiple providers. Cost, latency & security are all cited as the primary deciding factors when architecting a modern online game; but a new vector is emerging - speed. Specifically, speed of development; how fast can you FIND the game to make is the new race that modern games companies are finding themselves in & the open-source ecosystem is going to be their new best friend. Dominic Green will run through how Netspeak Games has taken advantage of cloud-native technologies and built out their games infrastructure on top of Kubernetes, Agones & Open Source Software - building an MMO that supports 100,000s of concurrent players. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ek9u"
