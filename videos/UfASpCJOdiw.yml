There’s more to Helm v3 than just the removal of Tiller though! In this session we’ll learn about the new features of Helm v3 and the changes and new architectures to support them. We’ll discuss the changes to the CLI and the underlying library and the subsequent improvements to usability. We’ll look at library charts and the new client/server security models. We’ll finish with a discussion on migrating charts from v2 to v3.\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zx4K"
