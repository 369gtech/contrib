description: "In this code-driven session, you will learn how to take a Java EE 6 application and leverage the new features in the Java EE 7 platform to further simplify the code. You will see how default resources allow you to replace commands specific to the application server to create these resources. Java Message Service has been renovated with all the modern language features and leverages dependency injection heavily to cut down on the boilerplate. Hacks for doing server-push are no longer required with the introduction of WebSocket. Third-party proprietary frameworks are not needed with the introduction of batch and concurrency. Learn more in this session.\n\n\nAuthors:\nArun Gupta\nArun Gupta is Director of Developer Advocacy at Red Hat and focuses on JBoss Middleware.
