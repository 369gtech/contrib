title: 'Toward A Better Front End Architecture: ELM'
language: English
recordingDate: 1507391286
description: "Amidst the overwhelming cacophony of competing JavaScript frameworks, Elm is a promising voice. Elm is a relatively new language that compiles to JavaScript. Elm is a functional language that encourages describing UI, state, and events in a declarative manner, while performing as good as or better than the current JavaScript framework hotness. With type safety and pure programming constructs, Elm promises code that has fewer bugs and is easier to reason about. In this talk, dive into Elm, exploring its syntax and more importantly its architecture. Learn about unidirectional data flow, composable UI components, update functions, and commands for side effects. Ultimately, discover how functional programming with Elmâ€™s architecture can solve real problems. Leave this talk equipped to start utilizing Elm to construct non-trivial apps with more maintainable code and better determinism.\n\nNote: (Around 42:54 Jeremy erroneously claimed that the error at the top of the file is a \"type error\". He meant to state that it was a syntax error.)\n\nSPEAKER: Jeremy Fairbank\n\nPERMISSIONS: Coding Tech received permission from the content owner to republish this video."
