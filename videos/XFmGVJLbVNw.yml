title: 'Real time identity graph - Fakrudeen Ali Ahmed'
recordingDate: 1588246640
description: 'Identity services team at Adobe builds identity graph that links multiple identities for a user across multiple devices into a single unified identity. As an use case, this graph can be used to transfer a "build your own vehicle" session at car website from desktop to mobile, "personalization without a login". This graph building was a batch process and was being updated once a week. This talk describes the design for Real time identity graph on Flink which builds and updates this identity graph in near real time with 50000+ events/second, 2B+ devices and serving 400 Million users. It also covers how we arrived at Flink itself after evaluating multiple systems for our use case.
