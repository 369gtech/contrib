title: 'YOW! Nights April 2015 - Ken Scambler - 2 Years of Real World FP at REA'
language: English
recordingDate: 1430017096
description: "Functional Programming has dramatically risen to mainstream prominence in the last decade, on the back of multi-core processors and growing developer disillusionment with the dominant OO paradigm. Frustrated with Java’s limitations, REA’s Residential team moved to Scala in 2013, to take better advantage of the benefits afforded by FP.\n\nAfter almost two years and 13 apps in production, Ken presents the lessons learnt so far, and how REA is navigating the challenges of introducing a new technology.  He also covers how they have managed an often-steep learning curve for multiple local and off-shore teams while reaping genuine technical benefits at the same time.\n\nKen Scambler is an experienced developer with a long interest in Functional Programming. As a Senior Developer at REA Group, he mostly works on Scala microservices, mentors new Scala programmers and fosters the contagion of FP. He is known for rote-learning the curiosities of legacy systems, and writing lengthy, therapeutic blog rants about them. He can be easily trolled by using the word “isomorphic” incorrectly.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
