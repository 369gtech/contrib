description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nServerless or Servicefull - Sebastien Goasguen, Triggermesh \n\nWhile containers and container orchestration has taken the world by storm over the last five years, serverless offering that hides the complexity of the underlying infrastructure and the application management mechanisms are becoming the norm within the main Cloud providers. In this talk we will discuss whether or not serverless should in fact be called \"servicefull\". Indeed serverless computing architecture is all about using events and functions to integrate cloud services together. The world is not so much without servers, they are definitely still there somewhere, but the world is now full of services. The cloud has become our kernel, it is made of a myriad of API exposing cloud services, our world has become servicefull and not serverless. With this difference exposed we will discuss how k8s extensions can help us integrate services and move towards servicefull applications. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ekEh"
