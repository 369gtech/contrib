title: 'David Greenberg -  Building Interactive Query Tools on Datomic'
recordingDate: 1395784375
description: 'One of Datomic''s oft-touted features is that its queries are just data structures. What does this mean for us as developers? In this talk, we''ll look at how we leveraged queries- as-data to build a UI that dynamically generates queries to answer complex questions about our data. We''ll look at design patterns for building a composable query engine on top of Datomic, UI patterns for exposing this to non-developers, and data modeling considerations to maintain high performance.'
