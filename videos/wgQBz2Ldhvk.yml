description: "Everyone worries about performance but few of us have the time to truly understand it. Fortunately, our modern JVMs and CPUs are capable of some amazing performance tricks, but those same tricks only make reasoning about performance that much harder.\n\nIn this talk, we'll take a look at some surprising and often unintuitive performance problems and solutions. Not simply with the goal of memorizing solutions but also to better understand the complexity that lies inside both JVMs and CPUs.\n\nDouglas Hawkins has been passionately developing software for the past 10 years -- creating applications for bioinformatics, finance, and retail.\n\nBut Doug's true interest has always been VM internals. Now a VM engineer at Azul Systems, he works on Azul's Zing VM full-time and is the lead developer of Azul's ReadyNow technology."
