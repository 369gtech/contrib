description: "Did you know that Kotlin is being used in production for over a few years now already? Both inside and outside of JetBrains there are people deploying Kotlin applications for Android platform, for Web Applications and just about any other type of application.\n\nWhy are people using it instead of Java or some of the other languages out there? Primarily because it provides significant benefits in terms of conciseness, readability and safety, without some of the drawbacks that adopting a new language has such as a higher learning curve or interoperability with existing code and ecosystems.\n\nIn this talk we’ll cover some aspects of Kotlin that can really help you in your daily development, focusing on solving issues versus highlighting language features.\n\nHadi Hariri, Software Developer. Creator of many things OSS. Passions includes Web Development and Software Architecture. Authored a couple of books, a few courses and has been speaking at industry events for nearly 15 years. Currently at JetBrains in the Evangelism team, among other things, and spends as much time as he can writing code."
