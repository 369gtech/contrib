description: "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised \n\nMobile computing as we know it today is just one application of wireless technology, and a fairly limited one at that. The iPhone—perhaps the most advanced piece of consumer electronics ever created—is going to look like a fax machine compared to what's next. Mobile is a warning shot—the coming wireless wave will profoundly change every aspect of society and potentially redefine what it means to be human. Please join Jonathan Stark for a hands-on webcast for a look at the past, present, and future—and what we can do to prepare for the revolution.\n\nAbout Jonathan Stark\n\nJonathan Stark is a mobile strategy consultant who helps CEOs transition their business to mobile.\n\nJonathan is the author of three books on mobile and web development, most notably O'Reilly's Building iPhone Apps with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript which is available in seven languages.\n\nHis Jonathan's Card experiment made international headlines by combining mobile payments with social giving to create a \"pay it forward\" coffee movement at Starbucks locations all over the U.S.\n\nProduced by: Yasmina Grecp"
