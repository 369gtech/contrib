title: 'Shawn Fair: Making the Shift From Boss To Coach at Stretch Conference 2020'
recordingDate: 1582182004
description: "This presentation is loaded with disruptive content for all leaders. It is dynamically delivered, engaging throughout and practical. Managers will learn about the five critical attributes and the three leadership styles a leader must demonstrate on a daily basis to ensure their team members follow.\n\nThe goal of this presentation is to help managers and executives of all levels to make the leap from boss to coach, from leading by their position to connecting with their employees. This is obtained by learning how to provide developmental coaching as a part of everyday contact. Becoming a coach begins with the manager understanding the coaching process and using it to move their employees and managers to self and peer coaching, so that everyone on the team becomes a coach and leader.\n\nA boss controls, exercise authority and mostly consume themselves with their own personal and professional growth. A coach trains, instructs and develops his or her team’s capacity in all facets of the industry. This allows their employees to see their job, their industry and the company’s vision through the lens of binoculars. Ironically the toughest person to lead is yourself. If you don’t lead yourself well, there is a high probability you won’t lead others well. The same principle that apply to developing others are the same principles that are necessary to develop yourself.\n\nStretch is a non-profit leadership and management conference that brings 500 attendees and 16 speakers from all around the world who want to build effective organizations since 2013. An international platform and community for leaders and managers to share stories, hands-on solutions and explore new trends and ideas to lead, fail, learn and stretch.
