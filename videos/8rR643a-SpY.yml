description: "At GTN we are combining ideas from quantum physics and chemistry with machine learning to aid the process of discovering new medicines. In this talk I will discuss the challenges of applying machine learning to molecular datasets. Issues of data representation are starkly different then for, say, image or text based data, and I will describe various ways to represent molecules, starting with simple representations such as SMILES strings, chemical fingerprints, and going on to more advanced graph based, and quantum mechanical representations. In going beyond text or matrix based representations to graphs, standard convolutional or RNN networks are no longer appropriate, and recently developed architectures specifically tailored for graph data need to be utilised. I will describe recent advances in so called “graph convolutional networks” that have generated best in class results on chemistry datasets, and will demo how one can curate molecular datasets from public sources, most prominently ChEMBL, and run advanced ML algorithms on them using publicly available python libraries such as RDKIT and deepchem.\n\nEVENT:\n\nPyData London Meetup #46\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nMichael Graig\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nPyData Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HOulHAUhQw"
