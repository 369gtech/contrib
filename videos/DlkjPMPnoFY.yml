title: 'YOW! CTO 2019 - Ted Tencza - Remote Teams: 5 Things I am Doing Wrong and Maybe You Should Too.'
recordingDate: 1582747202
description: "Its increasingly common that teams are distributed across multiple offices, in different countries, all working on the same product or project. But how do you make this work well? There seem to be a number of readily accepted tenants of conventional wisdom to help deal with leading distributed teams, from seeming good ideas “teams must be co-located” to ones that are purely economic “offshore teams can be run at a far lower cost”.\n\nThis talk will challenge the conventional wisdom around leading distributed teams. I will explore how I have structured distributed teams at finder.com, and explain where and why I deviate from conventional practices (teams are not co-located or bounded by geography for instance). I will show how ignoring or modifying these can produce much better outcomes, happier, more productive teams, and a great culture of distributed work.\n\nI have over 10 years experience leading geographically dispersed teams (in the US, Australia, Manila, and Europe) and growing successful high performing tech teams. I recently set up teams in the Philippines and Poland and will be drawing on that experience for this talk.\n\nTed has been a Software/Web development professional since 1997. Ted has over 21 years of experience in Software Development, the last 13 of which have been in leadership roles. He has ran multiple teams at Atlassian, Bigcommerce, finder.com and now Prospa, with experience in both Operational and Development projects. He enjoys focusing specifically on the SaaS offerings, as well as working on improving the recruiting, hiring, and on boarding of new developers.\n\nFor more on YOW!
