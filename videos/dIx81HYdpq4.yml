description: "Batch processing is a long-standing pillar of enterprise computing. But how do you handle batch workloads in a modern environment? This talk will introduce you to Spring Batch, the de facto standard in batch processing on the JVM. We will walk through how to configure batch applications using Spring, handle error conditions in the various ways that Spring Batch provides, and look at many of the features that Spring Batch has to enable developers to create robust batch applications.\n\nMichael Minella: Sr Manager, VMware\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/batching-for-the-modern-enterprise"
