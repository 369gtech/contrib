description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nThe Kubernetes Bug Bounty Program - What Researchers and Users Need to Know - Taahir Ahmed, Google & Reed Loden, HackerOne \n\nIn January, Kubernetes launched a bug bounty program (BBP), creating a centralized way for security researchers to report vulnerabilities they find in products in exchange for monetary rewards. Just as many organizations support open source by hiring developers, paying bug bounties directly supports security researchers. The Kubernetes BBP is particularly interesting as it’s still rare for a large scale, open-source infrastructure project to have a public BBP.  In this talk, we’ll cover what a BBP is and what it means for Kubernetes. We’ll cover vendor selection for the bug bounty, defining the scope and rewards, learnings from the private beta, and what you need to know as a researcher and user today. We’ll also reiterate how the Product Security Committee responds to new vulnerabilities, so you know what’s being done to keep clusters safe.\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zesx"
