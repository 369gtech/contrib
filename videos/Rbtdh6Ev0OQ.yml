description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io\_The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nIntroduction to NATS Streams and Services on Kubernetes -\_Waldemar Quevedo, Synadia \n\nStreams and Services are the two main building blocks for creating applications using NATS. \_Streams are perfect for emitting and consuming data whereas Services can be used for endpoints that expect a response (aka RPC). \_Furthermore, with NATS v2 features you can use these to model the flows of your data with imports and exports that are isolated via account namespaces for multi-tenancy. \_In this talk, you will learn how to architect your distributed application in terms of streams and services all plugged into NATS, as well as how to best use the tooling in the `nats-io/k8s` to setup a secure multi-region NATS deployment in Kubernetes using NATS Gateways and Leafnodes.\_ \n\nhttps://sched.co/cpAq"
