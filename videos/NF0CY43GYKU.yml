language: English
recordingDate: 1563201107
description: "Video from Devoxx Poland 2019.\n\nI don't know any other language with more pitfalls, perils and gotchas than Bash. Still, we use it in almost every larger project for deployment or maintenance scripts, because there is no any better and more ubiquitous choice on Unix platform. However, there is ridiculous amount of things that could go wrong if you don't have deep understanding of shell scripting. Your experience about typical issues with Java or other JVM languages is definitely not enough here. You need to deeply understand Linux ecosystem and its history in order to write correct script... or you don't? I will prove to you that Bash could be tamed and made easy if proper code quality standards and static analysis tools are applied and enforced in your delivery pipelines. I'll share my opinions and experiences from a large banking project and I'll tell you which IDEs, tools and style guides we use."
