description: "Filmed at https://2020.dotswift.io on February 3, 2020 in Paris. More talks on https://dotconferences.com/talks\n\nApp architecture has been a topic of many discussions in the iOS development community. Many developers and companies propose novel architecture options to supposedly improve the development of iOS apps, while Apple keeps supporting the MVC architecture. Guilherme shows what causes people to have problems with that architecture, how to avoid the common pitfalls and why adopting a shiny new architecture might not be the best solution."
