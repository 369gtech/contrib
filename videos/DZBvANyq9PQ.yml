description: "When /bin/sh Attacks: Revisiting \"Automate All the Things\"\n\nJ. Paul Reed, Netflix\n\nThe HBO hit series Westworld tells us of a place where we can \"Live without limits!\" This promise might remind us of the \"magic\" with which automation is often spoken about. To be sure, automation is a cornerstone of DevOps, SRE, and modern operations practices, the A in DevOps' venerable CAMS, and the subject of one of its oldest, most famous memes: \"Automate ALL the things.\"\n\nBut are there processes we shouldn't automate? What if HOW we automate actively causes us and the systems we're responsible for harm? We'll take a look what human factors have to do with automation as well as at some of the impacts and challenges pervasive automation has presented for systems administrator and SREs, along with some important considerations when automating our complex, living socio-technical systems, and some strategies to cope when the shell scripts strike back!\n\nhttps://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa19/conference-program"
