title: 'Demystifying Micro-Frontends (Luca Mezzalira, 2019)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1636120786
description: "Microservices provide a way to break up a monolithic architecture into multiple atomic units, allowing an independent scalability of a service. They also provide a better way to divide the domains across multiple teams.\n\nLuca Mezzalira explains how to apply the same principles to frontend applications, enabling you to scale up a project with tens of developers without reducing the throughput."
