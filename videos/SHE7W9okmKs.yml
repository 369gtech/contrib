description: "New architecture models based in Cloud services offer new possibilities to architects to design new kind of solutions. The objective of the session is to evidence that is possible to design architectures forgetting required infrastructure.\n\nDuring the talk we will start introducing serverless architectures based in Amazon Web Services. After that, we will show how an application can be executed without the needs of an explicit infrastructure. Servers and deployments knowledge are not necessary in this scenario.\n\nIn the session we will explain how we have built a sample of an incidents manager serverless application. The components required to execute and manage this application are Amazon API Gateway, AWS Lambda functions, Amazon S3 buckets, Amazon DynamoDB non-relational database, AWS CloudWatch operational and performance monitor, and AWS IAM Identity and Access Management.\n\nWe will explain, step by step, all the application modules."
