description: "Even the biggest commercial datasets can't rival those produced at CERN, home of the Large Hadron Collider. As scientists research the conditions that created our universe, the volume of data captured is truly staggering.\n\nKyle Cranmer\n\nNew York University\n\nKyle Cranmer is an Assistant Professor of Physics at New York University searching for new fundamental particles and interactions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Geneva, Switzerland. The LHC is producing what is arguably the largest dataset in the history of science, and Cranmer is one of the leading thinkers on how to exploit its scientific potential. This includes novel technologies for publishing scientific results, collaborative design of statistical models, and new approaches to open access and preservation of scientific data."
