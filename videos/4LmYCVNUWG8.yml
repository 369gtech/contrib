language: English
recordingDate: 1589900405
description: 'Robot Operating System(ROS) is a middleware that enables you to build distributed, scalable and modular robotic applications. The Edge Robotics team ported ROS on Windows and we are working on tools to make it easy for developers to use ROS on Windows. In addition to running your unit and integration tests as a part of your CI pipelines, you can also test the quality of a build, by running tests in simulation as well.  This is a quick demo to setup Continuous integration and Continuous simulation using Azure Pipelines for the ROS packages that you develop.'
