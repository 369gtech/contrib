language: English
recordingDate: 1433261121
description: "Today so many projects, both open source and closed source, suffer from lack of quality. Many of us are aware of the importance of testing in our development processes, but code review is something that is often overlooked or misunderstood. What does it mean to review code? Find bugs? Complain about tabs versus spaces? Or something more? Code review is about quality, humility, and sanity checks, and a good one takes some skill to do right. This session’s speaker goes over some tips he has found useful over years of doing code reviews. Good code review practice means changing the way you work for the better.\n\n\nAuthor:\nTrevor Lalish-Menagh\nTrevor Lalish-Menagh is a senior software engineer at thePlatform. Previously at Comcast Interactive Media, he spearheaded the front-end unit testing initiative, and co-created EnvJasmine (github.com/trevmex/EnvJasmine), a headless self-contained framework for testing front-end code in a continuous integration environment. He also headed up the move to git and gerrit for department-wide pre-commit code reviews. He has been a part of the Philly tech scene for the last six years and has been involved in organizing Philly.rb, Philly Lambda, Functional Fall, A.I. Winter, BarCamp Philly, and Philly ETE.
