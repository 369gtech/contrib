language: English
recordingDate: 1521249644
description: "Last year, Benoit and others were busy integrating and customising Barrel, a modern and opensource data platform with master-master replication written in Erlang.\n\nThis talk will describe the different challenge we faced in building a P2P middle-tier platform in Erlang to persist the data and “actors” states from micro-services in different levels of storage and replicate them between different locations. This talk will also describe the different patterns used for Reads and Writes concurrency but also continuous automated indexation of the data and “actors.”\n\nMore details here: https://codesync.global/speaker/benoit-chesneau/"
