Then came Kotlin\n\nThis pretty much sums up many presentations about Kotlin in the past two years. And it is a pretty reasonable opinion.\n\nBut let's not forget something: Kotlin is a programming language. In the end it is us who decide which code we are creating. And most of the time we seek what we envision as \"good\" code - clean, concise and understandable.\n\nThese 15 minutes will explore the darker parts. They will be dedicated to deliver \"evil\" intentions, possibilities to misuse even an appreciated language like Kotlin. So prepare for a discussion about obscurity, code injection and a little bit of ethics as spice.\n\nYou will like this talk if you...\n\n...want to do some \"unproductive\" but creative thinking\n...like jumbling with language features\n...simply love everything about Kotlin, even the questionable parts\n...never knew anything questionable about Kotlin and are eager to learn more about it\n\n \nSimon Schell \nFrom Provinzial Rheinland Versicherung AG\nI've always been bad at guessing what might be important for a biography. I started working for Provinzial right after school and completed my bachelors degree two years ago. During most of that time i worked with Java-based technologies and learned to love the language (always with a few points of spite of course). But i never got hung up on a single language. So far i dabbled with Scala, C#, Ruby, C++, Python and quite a few more exotic ones. Which is also the reason why i'm concentrating more on Kotlin right now, as it combines my interests in both old and new beautifully. At the same time i'm also enjoying some frontend development with Node, Angular and Typescript right now. So a healthy mix all in all ;)"
