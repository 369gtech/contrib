description: "Mashhood Rastgar \n\n\n\nLooking to deploy Python code on AWS Lambda? Getting started with serverless can be a bit daunting at times with creating the functions, configuring them, configuring api gateways and what not. In this talk you will learn about the magic of rapid serverless api development using AWS Chalice.\n\nOne of the best part of serverless is that you dont need to think much about the provisioning and deployment of your service once you are ready to deploy, and Chalice framework makes that a reality when working with Python. With its super simple CLI which scaffolds and deploys on AWS Lambda within minutes, and its helpful utility libraries you can create fast, scalable services in Python in no time.\n\nWe will demonstrate on how to get started using this simple framework, and what are some of the challenges to consider when working with serverless on AWS Lambda. How does local development work and what are some of the things to look out for when building using Chalice."
