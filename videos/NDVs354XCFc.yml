description: "https://jeeconf.com/program/apache-maven-support-all-java/\n\nWith the increased pace of new releases of Java it is good to understand how Maven can keep up with this new cadence. The biggest challenge was to have integrated support for the modular system as introduced with Java 9, but once this hurdle was taken it should be relatively easy for projects to move to the latest Java version, with or without the usage module descriptors. This session will demonstrate that Maven itself is ready for the migration process of Java projects, the challenge is much more in the projectcode itself."
