description: "Oracle is getting serious about the cloud and is building out new cloud services at a rapid pace. In order to build those hyper-scale, resource efficient multi-tenant services, they have chosen Docker containers and Kubernetes to optimize resource consumption and DevOps processes. Developing such services is just half the story; the other half is how to apply DevOps best practices, in order to run those services in an always on, hyper-scale and resilient way. Attend this session to hear the lessons learned by Oracle engineers from building these hyper-scale managed cloud services. They will discuss pros and cons of the architecture chosen, and will cover development as well as DevOps best practices, which allow them to offer those services to their customers. Come find out about the new forces at work within Oracle today.\n\nSpeakers: Dhiru Pandey, Boris Scholl"
