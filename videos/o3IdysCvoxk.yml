description: "Trisha Gee, Programmer / Developer, JetBrains\n\nMany JVM languages promote “less boilerplate code” as one of their selling points. Even updates to Java in recent years have removed unnecessary syntax. Although this is clearly meant to be a Good Thing, many of us think, “So what?” Our IDEs can generate code, and our brains get used to ignoring the stuff that doesn’t matter. This session explores common coding scenarios with Java and Kotlin. You’ll see what’s important for developers to write (and, more importantly, read) and what can be removed. You’ll also see how Java has evolved to improve our productivity as producers and consumers of code and why understanding new languages and staying up to date with the features of Java can ultimately make your life easier."
