description: "In the early days of my carrier as a Java developer most web applications where build using frameworks generating html (and JavaScript) on the server side. However, times are changing and nowadays most of us Java developers are branching out to new territories when building web applications. Angular, Ember, React or Polymer, they are quickly becoming part of the Java developer's toolbox.\n\nIn this presentation I will introduce you to yet another JavaScript framework for developing modern web applications; Aurelia. Written in tomorrow's JavaScript it is one of the least obtrusive frameworks out there. In a few slides and some code I hope to convince you why I think it is a worthy alternative.\n\nHarro Lissenberg\nI am a Software Engineer with a strong background in Java development. Slowly learning to appreciate frontend development using JavaScript (post ES5) and TypeScript.\n\n[ZWN-2846]"
