description: "The talk from .NET Fest conference in Kyiv, Ukraine.\nPresentation: http://www.nuke.build/netfest-kyiv-2019.pdf\nFb: https://www.facebook.com/dotNETFest/\nWebsite: http://dotnetfest.com/\n\nFounded in April 2017, NUKE is a free, open-source build automation system for C#/.NET that runs cross-platform on .NET Core, .NET Framework, and Mono. While builds are bootstrapped with conventional Bash or PowerShell scripts, their actual implementation resides in simple C# console applications. This approach unleashes the power of the type system and natively provides IDE features like code-completion, refactorings, and debugging. A custom global tool and several IDE extensions further improve how build projects are setup, authored and executed. A revolutionary code-generation approach ensures scalable integration of third-party tools like MSBuild or dotnet CLI. Come to this talk if you want to learn how to write maintainable and reliable builds with NUKE, which are also easily understood by everyone in your team!"
