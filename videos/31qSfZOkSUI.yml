language: English
recordingDate: 1602710380
description: "GitOps is a way of doing DevOps using git repositories as the source of truth for all configuration and code and automating deployments from those sources of truth. The team at InfluxData is running a database as a service on Kubernetes in multiple regions of multiple clouds, and they use GitOps to do this successfully and help us add even more clouds and regions without multiplying our effort.\n\nIn this webinar Rick Spencer, Head of Platform at InfluxData, will present:\n- What is “GitOps”, why the team adopted it, and what benefits they accrued.\n- Requirements and preconditions necessary for successful gitops.\n- Real-world examples of the metrics and observability used to monitor both deployments and the running application.\n- Lessons learned along the way.\n\nPresenter:\nRick Spencer, Head of Platform @InfluxData"
