description: "Ann Smith, Myk Dowling\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/77/\n\nSome projects seem to thrive year after year. Others get forked over and over until potential contributors face nigh-impossible decisions. Some just wither away and never produce a product.\n\nWhat keeps one project alive while others fail to thrive?\n\nWe look at an open source project in a crisis involving leadership and critical stakeholders, at how the crisis was resolved, and what the world of business research tells us about leadership. We can apply that body of knowledge to make our projects function better.\n\nReference list available at:  https://tinyurl.com/LeadershipSuccessReferences\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
