description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2018\n—\nIn spite of more than 40 years of programming practice, we still make even the most basic errors of API design and coding: integer overflow, error-prone floating point arithmetic, unconstrained/flawed templated interfaces.\nA few such examples from Boost, the C++17 standard and a discussion on generic and metaprogramming issues will illustrate why we need to focus more on quality and less on quantity.\nWhen the most basic building blocks offer few or no guarantees on the validity of their results, the task of writing correct programs becomes a lot more difficult. At the same time, the standard library is not providing some essential primitives that would make writing correct code easier and with better performance characteristics.\nThe presentation will also include a surprise guest from the functional programming languages family.\n— \nAndrei Zlate-Podani, Avast\nTeam Lead\n\nAndrei Zlate-Podani has been writing software professionally for 18 years, of which he spent more than a decade writing device drivers.\nHis software currently runs on more than 160 million computers worldwide and most bugs that ship in the release version will affect a significant number of customers. This gave him the motivation to look more deeply into the subject of writing correct software and not just functioning software. He has researched how could the guidelines used for critical systems (MISRA C & C++) be applied for normal application development.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
