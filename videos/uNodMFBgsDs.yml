title: 'Semantic Event Sourcing: case study of moving from CRUD to log based state management - Neil Boddy'
language: English
recordingDate: 1568464777
description: "Video from Devoxx Poland 2019.\n\nWhile big data techniques such as log based systems offer robust and scalable state management, crawling data at scale is not without its challenges. This presentation offers an approach developed for managing the state in a master data management system using MongoDB that facilitates accelerated traversal of a multi-dimension time series through the use of auxiliary information, in addition to improving the overall utility of the data.\n\nWhile this approach was developed specifically for master data management, it may be applicable more broadly to other applications managing batch oriented state at scale.\n\nThis presentation may be of interest to any practitioner considering adopting and advancing non-CRUD based state management across their firms."
