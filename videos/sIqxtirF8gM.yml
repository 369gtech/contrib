description: "How Can You Scale It If You Don't Trust It?\n\nDavid N. Blank-Edelman, Apcera\n\nWhen you scale up an infrastructure it is crucial that you can trust you have the right resources in play, the right code deployed and that information can only flow in a secure manner. When you scale the organization, trust is required amongst all of the people responsible for coding, testing, deploying and managing the applications that power the business.\n\nWith all of the chatter around scaling, you would think someone would have told you the key ingredient necessary for creating and fostering the required trust. Unfortunately it is very easy to get to the end of the diving board, right on the edge of jumping into something like a hybrid cloud deployment, before you realize you need to figure this out on your own.\n\nThis talk can help. We’ll discuss some concrete ways you can engineer trust into the system (complete with examples) you are building or operating so that it works well for cloud-native and legacy applications. By the end, you’ll have a good idea of the decision/enforcement points you’ll need to consider to be able to create a system (and an organization) that can scale.\n\nDavid is the Technical Evangelist at Apcera. He has spent thirty years in the systems administration/DevOps/SRE field in large multiplatform environments including Brandeis University, Cambridge Technology Group, MIT Media Laboratory and Northeastern University. He is the author of the O'Reilly Otter book (Automating System Administration with Perl) and is a frequent invited speaker/organizer for conferences in the field. David is honored to serve on the USENIX Board of Directors. He prefers to pronounce Evangelist with a hard 'g'.\n\nView the full LISA15 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa15/conference-program"
