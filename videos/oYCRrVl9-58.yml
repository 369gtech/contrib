recordingDate: 1459618542
description: "Building plugins for Gradle is not difficult. Building good DSLs for Gradle plugins is harder. I would like to take you on a journey through various recipes that can be applied to make your Gradle plugin more gradlesque. From the basic of handling task properties through to the esoterics of loading dependencies in integration tests or how to use a plugin to build itself (!). This session will also explore the new model which is currently incubating in the 2.x series.\n\nIf you are a experiences plugin author or a budding new one, you'll probably learn something; just as I did in the procecess of authoring a book on this subject."
