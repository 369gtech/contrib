description: "DeepMind builds AI systems that can learn new skills and ideas, to help people solve problems that can seem impossible today - such as the urgent challenge of climate change. Within Google, DeepMind’s systems have found creative new ways to reduce energy consumption at every scale, from the Android phone in your pocket, to the data centres that power web services. They’ve also discovered how to make the energy from Google’s windfarms 20% more valuable. DeepMind co-founder Mustafa Suleyman will share the insights the team has learned so far, and how these techniques could help many other companies and industries to reduce their costs and environmental impact. \n\nWatch more #io19 here: \nInspiration at Google I/O 2019 Playlist → https://goo.gle/2LkBwCF\nGoogle I/O 2019 All Sessions Playlist → https://goo.gle/io19allsessions \nLearn more on the I/O Website → https://google.com/io\n\nSubscribe to the Google Developers Channel → https://goo.gle/developers\nGet started at → https://developers.google.com/\n\nSpeaker(s): Mustafa Suleyman\n\nT9FFEA"
