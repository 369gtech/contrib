description: 'I will cover some of the new data structure developments that enable the Scala parallel collections, our new concurrent hash tries, and perhaps a couple of other new structures that will be public by then, All this from the internal algorithm and data structure design point of view rather that the language. All of them are applicable in the Clojure context and therefore perhaps of interest to your audience. The main focus has been on trying to make things simpler for the developer to exploit the multi-core performance potential of modern machines, hence the title.'
