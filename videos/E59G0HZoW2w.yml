description: "For years, developers have tried to find an easier way to create mobile apps. They discover hybrid mobile apps, but soon find out that hybrid wasn't ready for prime-time. Developers encounter problems with speed, building good-looking UIs, and a plethora of hardware differences that force them to go back to the land of native.\n\nAngularJS changed building apps for the web. Ionic changes building hybrid apps on mobile. Easy-to-use, beautiful, and ready to perform, Ionic is an open source framework made for hybrid apps. This talk introduces developing for mobile with AngularJS and how to supercharge it with Ionic.\n\nGerred Dillon\nDeveloper Evangelist, Ionic\nhttp://ionicframework.com/\nhttps://twitter.com/justicefries\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
