description: "From OSCON 2014: Kids can start to learn to program at any age; I started at six. All I needed was tools, guidance, and encouragement. Once I got hooked, a whole new world of possibilities opened up for me. I could create my own video games instead of being restricted by the rules of games made by others. I could make my school projects cooler by adding a technological aspect. And soon, I was processing DNA and neurological data using algorithms. I love to share my enthusiasm for programming and hope to inspire you to share that spark with others.\n\nAbout Shadaj Laddad (School):\nShadaj is a 14 year old who loves to program. He has programmed in Logo, NXT Mindstorms, Ruby, Python, C, Java, and Scala—his favorite. Shadaj hosts his projects on GitHub, and has an educational channel on Youtube. He has presented at Scala Days 2013, Scala Days 2012, and the Bay Area Scala Enthusiast group showing his Scala projects. Besides programming, he likes Math and Science. Shadaj is also an active member of his school community as Student Council President. He loves spreading a love of technology, and started TechTalks—a program that brings guest speakers to share their knowledge and enthusiasm with students at his school. When not doing his school work or programming, he plays guitar, sitar, and games, some of which he created.\n\nWatch more from OSCON, O'Reilly's open source convention: http://goo.gl/HlGwvP\nFind out more about the convention: http://oscon.com\n\nDon't miss an upload!
