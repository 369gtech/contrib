description: "GraalVM is a high-performance polyglot runtime for dynamic, static, and native languages. One of the abilities of GraalVM is to compile Java programs ahead of time into native images that offer performance comparable to running on the JVM but have instant startup times and much lower runtime overhead. Generating native images is proven to work on real-world applications and improve their startup miraculously.\n\nIn this session, you will learn how native images work and what is required to generate them and will look at several examples of compiling programs ahead of time and packaging them into minimal containers.\n\nYou’ll also see how to configure native image generation, use the autoconfiguration agent for reflection, proxies and alike, and make libraries support native images out of the box.\n\nHello there! Oleg is a friendly neighborhood developer advocate for @GraalVM at OracleLabs, Oracle. Loves all languages. Helps @virtualJUG, @GDGTartu. In 2017 became a Java Champion."
