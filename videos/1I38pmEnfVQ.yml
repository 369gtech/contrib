language: English
recordingDate: 1492679010
description: "Java is becoming a first-class language for cross-platform mobile development. In this session, we give an overview of the status of Java on iOS and Android. We cover the VM and AOT options, the JavaFX UI framework (using javafxports), the IDE plugins and other tools, and the integration options with cloud and back-end systems.\n\nThe Write Once Run Anywhere idea is no longer a dream. Your favourite IDE and the Gluon plugin is all you need to create apps that can be uploaded to the App Store and Play Store.\n\nJohan Vos started to work with Java in 1995. He was part of the Blackdown team, porting Java to Linux. His main focus is on end-to-end Java, combining back-end systems and mobile/embedded devices. He received a Duke Choice award in 2014 for his work on javafx on mobile. In 2015, he co-founded Gluon, which allows enterprises to create (mobile) Java Client applications leveraging their existing backend infrastructure. Gluon received a Duke Choice award in 2015. Johan is a Java Champion, a member of the BeJUG steering group, the Devoxx steering group and he is a JCP member. He is the lead author of the Pro JavaFX 8 book, and he has been a speaker at numerous conferences on Java.\n\nEugene Ryzhikov is a software architect with extensive experience in a wide range of technologies. For most of his career he has been working inside the Java universe using Java and Scala. In 2015, he cofounded Gluon, which allows enterprises to create mobile Java client applications leveraging their existing back-end infrastructure. Gluon received a Dukeâ€™s Choice award in 2015."
