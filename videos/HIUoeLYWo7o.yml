language: ""
recordingDate: 1513269137
description: "Spring Boot has adopted Micrometer as its built-in metrics instrumentation library with out-of-the-box support for popular monitoring tools like Prometheus, Datadog, InfluxDB, New Relic, Elasticsearch MetricBeat, Graphite, and more! Micrometer is a metrics instrumentation facade that helps you instrument your code once and ship to one more monitoring systems while avoiding vendor lock-in. Think SLF4J, but for metrics. In this talk, we'll walk through practical exercises that demonstrate proper way to instrument your application code to yield actionable metrics insights and alerts.\n\nJon Schneider, Principal Software Engineer, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2017"
