But did you know it is open source, and runs on Linux too?\n\nJoin this talk to learn why server-side Swift is the new hot topic. We'll talk about how the latest Swift 3 release brings improved performance, functionality and productivity to Swift, and how Swift is a great fit for the cloud.\n\nThere are new web frameworks written in Swift, such as Kitura. Learn how to get started with your first Swift web app, and how to join the growing open source Swift community.\n\nIan Partridge is a senior developer at Swift@IBM, working to bring Swift to the cloud on Linux.
