Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nSharing Is Caring! Push Your Cloud Application to an OCI Registry - Silvin Lubecki & Djordje Lukic, Docker \n\nDid you know that you can store anything into a container image registry? Did you ever wonder what black magic is behind multi-arch images? OCI Image specification is a standard purposely generic enough to enable use cases other than “just” container images.    While working on the Cloud Native Application Bundle (CNAB) project, we built tooling to package whole applications as OCI Images so that they could be pushed to and pulled from registries. We learnt a lot doing this and would like to share with the community.     During this talk, we will have a quick but in-depth view of:  * The OCI Image specification and its future  * How to push a multi service application to a registry  * Our battle scars with the different interpretations of the OCI spec by the mainstream registries\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zemr"
