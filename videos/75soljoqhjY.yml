description: "Kubernetes is great and solutions like Minikube allow to develop against a local cluster. However, it can get quite difficult when you need to run more than a dozen pods on developer's laptop.\n\nThe smart way would be to run a single pod locally (the service you are working on) and somehow connect to the other services in a development cluster. Your local copy should be able to talk to other services in the cluster while they should be able to communicate with your service as if it were in the cloud.\n\nThis is exactly what Telepresence.io allows you to do. Join me to find out how this clever open source tool can significantly reduce your development feedback time."
