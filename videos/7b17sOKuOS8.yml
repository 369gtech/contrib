Jenkins job configuration within the build.\n3. Release process configuration with gradle-release plugin.\n4. How to store credentials and other secured information not in the script (locally and on Jenkins).\n5. Problems whit hierarchical multimodule projects.\n6. Common rules how we moved puld logic to plugin.\n7. How to apply plugin for itself (Because plugin is also project and we have to follow company conventions that we applied to other projects through the plugin.\n8.
