description: "Reactive Programming is receiving quite a bit of attention and for good reasons. It’s a nice logical next step from functional programming. It takes the concept of function composition and lazy evaluations to the next level. It streamlines handling of many critical issues that are architectural in nature: resilience, scale, responsiveness, and messaging. In this session, we will start with a quick introduction to reactive programming. We will then dive into code examples and learn how to create reactive applications. We’ll learn to implement observables, to deal with errors in a graceful manner, learn both synchronous and asynchronous solutions, hot vs. cold observables, and dealing with backpressures.\n\nDr. Venkat Subramaniam is an award-winning author, founder of Agile Developer, Inc., creator of agilelearner.com, and an instructional professor at the University of Houston. He has trained and mentored thousands of software developers in the US, Canada, Europe, and Asia, and is a regularly-invited speaker at several international conferences. Venkat helps his clients effectively apply and succeed with sustainable agile practices on their software projects.\n\nVenkat is a (co)author of multiple technical books, including the 2007 Jolt Productivity award winning book Practices of an Agile Developer. You can find a list of his books at agiledeveloper.com. You can reach him by email at venkats@agiledeveloper.com or on twitter at @venkat_s\n\n[NXW-8662]"
