description: "Securing Kafka with SPIFFE at TransferWise - Jonathan Oddy, Levani Kokhreidze\n\nFor a long time in order to achieve mutual TLS between Kafka brokers and its clients we had to use long-lived certificates which is a nightmare to manage at large scale. At TransferWise, we have around 300 microservices and most of them use Kafka for the async communication, stream processing, event sourcing, etc. We wanted to implement Kafka security in a way that reduced the maintenance burden on platform teams, while making migration of diverse clients as simple as possible. In this talk we will describe how we have achieved that goal using SPIFFE with SPIRE and Envoy, requiring zero code changes on the client side.\n\nDon’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects."
