description: "In his Lambda Jam keynote, \"Everything I Have Learned I Have Learned From Someone Else,\" David Nolen exposed the joys and benefits of reading academic papers and putting them to work. In this talk, we show how to translate the mathy figures in Computer Science papers into Clojure code using both core.match and core.logic. You'll gain strategies for understanding concepts in academic papers by implementing them!\n\nNada Amin is a member of the Scala team at EPFL, where she studies type systems and hacks on programming languages. She has contributed to Clojure's core.logic and Google's Closure compiler. She's loved helping others learn to program ever since tutoring SICP as an undergraduate lab assistant at MIT.\n\nWilliam E. Byrd is a Postdoctoral Researcher in the School of Computing at the University of Utah. He is co-author of The Reasoned Schemer, and co-designer of several declarative languages: miniKanren (logic programing), Harlan (GPU programming), and Kanor (cluster programming). His StarCraft 2 handle is 'Rojex' (character code 715)."
