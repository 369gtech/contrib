description: "They say Spring Boot is full of strange magic, but if you’ve already managed to get things in order, don’t be sad, as there are lots of things that can be added when you use not Java, but it’s “modernized” version.\n\nAt least, that’s how Xtend language postures itself on the official website. The first thing the modernizations allow you to do is to write less code in a manual way, which means you’ll do it faster and make fewer mistakes.\n\nIn this talk, we’ll develop a simple app based on famous technologies, such as Spring Boot and Spring Data (Rest), using all the features provided by Xtend, like Active Annotations.\n\nThere’ll be enough magic, but, as we’ll see, you can keep everything under control if you choose the right instrument.\n\nIn the exposure part, we’ll dwell on Xtend basic features and look at Active Annotations out of the box, the way they work, along with how and why to write your active annotation processor and how to test it."
