language: English
recordingDate: 1530620576
description: "Filmed at https://2018.dotscale.io on June 1st in Paris. More talks on https://www.dotconferences.com/talks\n\nTimescaleDB offers three seemingly heretical insights about data: (1) all data is time-series; (2) what you've heard about it is wrong; and (3) SQL should and does remain the lingua franca for databases.\n\nThese insights enable new possibilities for architecting database systems, and Mike briefly discusses how TimescaleDB, an open-source time-series database purpose-built on top of PostgreSQL, realizes these needs."
