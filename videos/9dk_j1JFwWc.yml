As containers can be started in no time, building new container images replacing old ones has become the predominant way of applying updates. Having continuous delivery pipelines for building these images becomes a key problem. This talk will show how the Open Build Service provides a way to automate container builds including tracking updates and automatic rebuilds of dependent containers. This makes it easy to create secure and up to date containers all day.\n\n\n\nCornelius Schumacher"
