title: 'GeeCON Prague 2019: Jakub Nabrdalik - Common mistakes when moving to microservices'
recordingDate: 1574262662
description: 'While helping organizations move to microservices and public clouds, I’ve noticed a lot of common problems. Architecture is described at infrastructure level (k8s, cloud services, etc.) without any focus on domain architecture. Enterprise architects are put in charge of software architecture. Architecture guilds are created without introducing the required practices and culture. QA still thinks that end to end tests are possible. Managers want to sign-off and control deployments. Pipelines and processes are forced on devs, not allowing them to become devops (the culture doesn’t change). Devs do not learn the different flavors of event based architecture, relying on REST everywhere. Kafka is treated as a message queue (no streaming, no read models, no persistence). Half-baked tools provided as a service by the cloud are assumed to be cheaper/safer to use than self-hosted open source. Teams are created without repo ownership, creating an error prone setup. Finally business pivots are not taken into account, when designing the system. I’ll discuss all those problems, and hopefully provide some usable solutions.'
