description: "by Mat Booth\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/UD2.218A/dark_peak_data_co_op.webm\n\n\nDark Peak is a user-run co-operative providing hosted open-source software for the benefit of our members. \n\nThis is the story of how some geeks from Sheffield are working together to free their data from the tyranny of global corporations! We each want better control over what we share online and how our data is used, so we founded an organisation democratically run and owned by its users. By sharing resources and expertise, our volunteers aim to provide convenient alternatives that put you back in control, according to our four main principles: \n\n\nData with representation\nPromote the dignity of data ownership\nProvide the freedom to host some or all services yourself\nFederate and interoperate where possible\n\n\n\nThis talk aims to give an overview of our organisation and how we came to be, what choices we made and why we made them and the mistakes we made along the way -- we want to share what we've learned from both organisational and technical points of view. \n\nWe hope the audience will be enthusiastic about self-hosting, and are interested in seeing the power of running or joining a self-hosting co-op. \n\nRoom: UD2.218A\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 16:00:00+01"
