title: 'The Velvet Revolution: Dockerizing Legacy ASP.NET Apps - Elton Stoneman'
recordingDate: 1492682108
description: "Docker has the potential to revolutionize how we build, deliver, support and even design software. But it doesn't have to be a violent revolution. The end goal might be breaking your existing ASP.NET monolith into microservices which run cross-platform on .NET Core, but the first step can be as simple as packaging your whole application as-is into a Docker image and running it as a container.\nIn this session we'll take an existing ASP.NET MVC application and package it as a Docker container image, which we can run on Windows Server 2016 and Windows 10. We'll see where the packaging process fits in a CI/CD build, and deploy our app on a clustered Docker Swarm running in Azure. That gives us a scalable, reliable platform for our legacy app, and we'll end by exploring where that can take us."
