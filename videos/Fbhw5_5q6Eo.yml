description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.    \n\nSponsored Keynote: The Rise of the End Users - Diane Mueller, Community Development, Red Hat\n\nToday, end users are not just “using” open source software, they are active and valuable participants in the communities and are helping to drive innovation into the upstream projects, driving projects out into the open from behind the firewall for the benefit of all.  End user participation is key to the success and health of the entire ecosystem. After all, who understands better the challenges of cloud native adoption and migration than the users themselves? Helping more companies to navigate the cloud native ecosystem and participate in open source is essential to all our success. Come hear how they are making an impact in open source and learn what we can all do to ensure their success. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ep4i"
