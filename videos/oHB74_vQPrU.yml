Whether via frameworks like React, native techniques like web components, or something else, components are rapidly becoming an essential part of web development. With them come tools and services designed to support teams using components, and cultural change too. This talk will make you think about the principles of your development process, with innovative approaches to style guides, component registries and other services to support new, more scalable web development practices. Using these new approaches requires modern browser features, so I’ll also be talking about a new public project sponsored by the FT and Fastly to build a community polyfill service. It’s time to upgrade the web.\n\nAbout Andrew Betts (FT Labs):\nAndrew is a web developer, standards advocate and founder of FT Labs, an emerging web technologies division of the Financial Times in London.
