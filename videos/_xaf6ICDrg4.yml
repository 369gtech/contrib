title: 'Keynote: Stream analytics made real with Pravega and Apache Flink - Srikanth Satya'
recordingDate: 1588246712
description: 'Streaming applications have evolved and the systems that support such applications along with them. Applications today are part of complex ecosystems and not standalone applications. As such, the expectation of the features offered by streaming systems and platforms are more stringent than ever. With such requirements in mind, we have designed and built Pravega, a software system that exposes stream as a core storage primitive. Pravega enables applications to ingest and store unbounded data streams in an elastic and consistent manner. Combining Pravega and Apache Flink, we are able to build data pipelines that are able to tail and historically process stream data, to dynamically and to satisfying exactly-once semantics end-to-end. We have joined Pravega and Apache Flink in the Streaming Data Platform, a Dell Technologies product, and we share in this keynote our experience so far with the users of the platform. Use cases span from analyzing drone video streams to computer vision in connected cars.'
