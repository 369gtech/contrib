description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nUsing Argo and Knative to Orchestrate Media-intensive Services in 5G Edge - David Breitgand, IBM \n\nKubernetes is at the core of the cloud-native transformation. In this talk, we will discuss how Argo Workflows, Argo Events and Knative can help with cost-efficient and extremely flexible orchestration of complex network-intensive services on Kubernetes. We will discuss a Knative based deployment of Argo Workflow and Argo Events and demonstrate how we used these technologies in 5G-MEDIA (http://www.5gmedia.eu/) to orchestrate media intensive network services, such as tele-immersive gaming and mobile journalism in a 5G Edge. We argue that CNCF technologies can very efficiently complement traditional orchestration tools used by telcos, such as OSM, which are not sufficiently flexible to orchestrate highly dynamic session-oriented container based workloads of this kind.\n\nhttps://sched.co/ZesQ"
