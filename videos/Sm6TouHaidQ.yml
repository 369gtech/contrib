description: "Weâ€™re familiar with Python as a scripting language, as a web server language, as a teaching language, as a data analysis language, and as a teaching language. But is that the limit of where Python can be used? What is the future for Python on other platforms?

And how does this threat intersect with other threats we have to our community, and to our industry?\n\nEVENT: PyCon Australia\n\nSPEAKER: Russell Keith-Magee\n\nPERMISSIONS: The original video was published on the PyCon Australia YouTube channel with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nORIGINAL SOURCE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1sDyVJm3Ht0&t=259s"
