title: '#HITB2021AMS D1T2 - When Qiling Framework Meets Symbolic Execution - KJ Lau, Kong, ZiQiao & ChenXu'
language: English
recordingDate: 1623120514
description: "Ever since the release of Qiling Framework in 2019, It provides reverse engineers with the best instrumentation experience across the industry. Various tools build on top of Qiling Framework for dynamic analysis purposes. But, there is one thing missing in the framework, symbolic execution.\n\nSymbolic execution is one of the most powerful strategies to automate binary analysis. By integrating Qiling Framework and Radare2 ESIL(an open source and target neural intermediate language), Qiling Framework is able to bring symbolic execution to all the supported architecture. As always, a symbolic execution engine with lots of high level APIs.\n\nIn this talk, we will discuss the reason why we decided to add a symbolic execution module into Qiling Framework. We will also share the problems and how we manage to solve all the challenges.\n\nThere will also be few very exciting demonstrations on how the engine works and how we can solve challenges with this new symbolic execution engine. \n\nWith this new module added into Qiling Framework, it will be a brand new experience in both dynamic analysis and symbolic execution world. Hope to see more exciting ideas and tools built on top of the Qiling Framework.\n\nFinally, specials guess appearance, Qiling Framework latest EVM engine DEMO!\n\n=== \n\nKaiJern (xwings), is Lab Director of The ShepherdLab, of JD Security. His research topic mainly on embedded devices, hardware security, blockchain security, reverse engineering and various security topics. He presented his findings in different international security conferences like Blackhat, Defcon, HITB, Codegate, QCon, KCon, Brucon, H2HC and etc. He conducted hardware Hacking courses in various places around the globe. He is also the owner of hackersbadge.com, actively involved in Unicorn (https://unicorn-engine.org) development and founder of Qiling Framework (https://qiling.io)\n\n--- \n\nZiqiao Kong is a security researcher at the Shepherd Lab of JD Security and a core member of Qiling Framework. He has broad research interests in binary analysis, reverse engineering and code audit. He was awarded the Hall of Fame in GeekPwn 2019 and gave talks at BlackHat, SDC 2020 and HITB. He also has papers published in top security conferences.\n\n---\n\nChen Xu Wu is a security researcher at the Shepherd Lab of JD Security. His research focuses on automated binary analysis. He was a speaker of BlackHat Asia 2020, BlackHat Europe 2020, China kanxue SDC 2020, HITB Labs 2020.  He is also a core developer for Qiling Framework (https://qiling.io)"
