description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nCloudEvents - Looking Beyond Event Delivery - Remi Cattiau, Nuxeo\n\nWhile CloudEvents helps in the delivery of events from a producer to a destination, when considering the entire lifecycle of an event there's a lot more to consider. For example, how does someone discover which events can be generated and by which producer? What transport mechanisms for event delivery are available? How does someone subscribe to receive events? Today there's no consistent mechanism to answer these questions. This session will explore how the CloudEvents project is working to solve these issues by providing a quick overview of the new specifications being developed - and, of course, give an update on the CloudEvents specification itself."
