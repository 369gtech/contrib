description: "That's My Monkey (A Functional, Reactive, Domain Driven Design, and Common Sense Approach To Architecture) - Rob Martin (Lambda Days 2017)\n\n\nhttp://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2017/rob-martin\n\nArchitecture is something we usually get for free from our web frameworks, and then struggle with as we try to keep servers standing when our projects succeed. There's a reason for this: the vast majority of our frameworks are based on patterns that worked in 2007 but don't match today's need for highly reliable, highly scalable applications. That's My Monkey explores an architecture based on domain driven design, event stores, distributed databases, message queues, and functional programming principles; then looks at how this architecture affects workflow, design, and the value delivered to the user and the business."
