title: 'Printed circuit artboards - how rapid PCB manufacturing is a thing of beauty'
recordingDate: 1548125250
description: "Christopher Biggs\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/219/\n\nFor Christmas 2018 I made an IoT-enabled LED star for our Christmas tree. \r\nI designed it in an afternoon and had the circuit boards in my hands 5 days later, for a cost of $5.00 for ten.\r\n\r\nLearn how to get the most out of PCB design tools and PCB manufacture services to let your electronic circuits become a feature of your art.\r\n\r\nA circuit board doesn't have to be green, and it doesn't have to be rectangular.  You can make your circuit part of your art by varying\r\n  * the shape of the board itself, or\r\n  * including artistic elements in the silk-screen overlay, or even\r\n  * make your copper tracks an artwork of their own\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
