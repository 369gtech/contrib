description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nOutgrowing Terraform - Nic Cope, Upbound & Dalorion Johnson, Guidewire\n\nCurious how Crossplane compares to Terraform? In this session Dalorion and Nic will discuss some of the challenges organisations can face when they need to scale their Terraform use to empower multiple teams to collaborate on declarative infrastructure management, and how Crossplane addresses these challenges. The session will be rooted in Dalorion’s experiences building and managing advanced Terraform configurations for a large software engineering organisation. Nic will highlight how the kind of challenges faced by Guidewire have informed Crossplane’s architectural decisions, allowing it to overcome some of Terraform’s pain points."
