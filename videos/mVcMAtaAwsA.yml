title: 'Jani Eväkallio - This is a Talk About You'
recordingDate: 1536844630
description: 'Over the last three years, I’ve spoken to hundreds of React Native developers, and slowly a picture emerges. It’s a picture of excitement and frustration, obsession with technology and pushing the boundaries. It’s a picture of you. This talk will blend meticulous research, subjective personal experiences and speculative fiction to discover the core of that elusive Developer Experience, and ask the inconvenient questions you’ve always been afraid to ask.'
