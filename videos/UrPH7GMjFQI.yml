description: "The talk from QA Fest 2019 conference in Kyiv, Ukraine.\nPresentation: will be added soon\_\nFb: https://www.facebook.com/QAFest/\nWebsite: http://qafest.com/\n\n\nHave you ever collected code coverage with tests? Most likely it was unit tests. But have you tried to collect them from automated tests, manual tests? What if you even had an incredible number of 100% coverage, does it give you any understanding. Can you make it actionable? In order to solve this issue - we wrote our own tooling, made it simple and pluggable, without app code affect, and accidentally did more than competitors, but open sourced. With this talk I will introduce the new tool, share our approach, describe benefits of test to code mapping, tell you how to make coverage numbers actionable, introduce first steps to try it at-home, and will share our plans going forward and how we plan to shift black-box testing to white-box."
