title: 'Next Generation Asynchronous Patterns in JavaScript - Jonathan Mills'
recordingDate: 1493103341
description: "With ES6 and ESNext we are no longer limited to simple callbacks when dealing with our asynchronous JavaScript code. This session will walk through four options for async patterns, addressing when to use each one and identifying the problems they solve.\nWe will start with a discussion of ES6 Promises and generators, continue with ESNext Async/Await, and close with a conversation about RxJS. Broaden your understanding of the available tools and start writing better asynchronous JavaScript today."
