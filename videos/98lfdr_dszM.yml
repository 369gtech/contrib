description: "The Agile Manifesto makes little mention of anyone except developers pairing with each other, which we feel is a missed trick.\n\nThe idea is that designers and developers should work more closely. Share desk space, war stories, and insight into customers and technology. From better mutual understanding comes better results.\n\nWe will use a live pairing demo to show just how valuable designer and developer pairing can be.\n\nWe’ll use examples to cover off pairing developers with designers: from understanding of the customer to the opportunities presented by the technology, and why it’s so relevant in out IoT, mobile and multi-touchpoint society\n\nCharles is a developer at ThoughtWorks. He enjoys working with mobile devices and hardware to create cool experiences for users - he’s made iPad-controlled robot arms, Kinect-powered mouse pointers and a personalised weight-loss app that learns about you over time.\n\nGreg is a designer at ThoughtWorks. He’s worked with clients in a variety of sectors and contributes to the Melbourne UX scene. He’s passionate about all things design and spent time working in Architecture before adapting his experience to digital.\n\nFor more on YOW! Connected, visit http://connected.yowconference.com.au"
