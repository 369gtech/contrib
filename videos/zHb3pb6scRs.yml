description: "JavaFX has added tools to simplify the creation of standalone applications for the core platforms that Java supports. In this session, you will learn how to use your build tool of choice (as long as it is Gradle, Ant, or Maven) to create these native bundles and the many ways you can customize the resulting bundles.\n\n\nAuthor:\nDanno Ferrin\nDanno Ferrin is a Software Engineer at Fluke Networks by day, where he is enhancing a long-standing application to work on JavaFX and mobile devices. He has worked with Java since the beta release in 1995 and has only had one software job where he hasn't used a JVM on a daily basis.  He has contributed to several open source projects including committing to Apache Tomcat, Apache Ant, the Groovy Programming Language and co-founded the Griffon Framework.  He sings tenor, used to play the clarinet and piano, and was an award winning debater for his high school speech team.  His favorite colors are green and orange.\nView more trainings by Danno Ferrin at https://www.parleys.com/author/danno-ferrin\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
