description: "Android Security is quite multifaceted - not surprisingly given the depth and complexity of the Android OS. In this talk, you will learn what makes up the various layers of security and how they work together. By the end of this talk, you'll have a solid understanding of various security concerns from the low level kernel to the high level app permissions, and everything in between. This talk focuses on the entire platform, not just the apps layer.\n\n** More resources on open source development at http://marakana.com/s\n**Want to learn more about Android Security?
