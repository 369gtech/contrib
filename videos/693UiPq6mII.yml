description: "Opening a warehouse is a long and challenging process, not to mention costly. So if you're going to go through all that work to open and operate a warehouse, you'll want to make sure you can run it as efficiently as possible. Enter SimPy (rhymes with \"Blimpie\"). SimPy is a discrete event simulator software library that allows us to asynchronously schedule and process events.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.
