recordingDate: 1463810359
description: "What could wearables for cats be? Iâ€™ve been working on wearables that aim to improve feline fitness and overall happiness. The system is made up of a smart collar and smart toys.\n\nThe talk will cover:\n\n* Research involved: hardware, cat psychology and IoT\n* Prototyped the different parts of the wearables at different stages\n* Calculating an algorithm for cat steps\n* User testing with cats\n\nI would like to challenge attendees to think of new directions for where to take the internet of things. This talk will empower attendees to pursue IoT projects that they otherwise would have been scared off of, through showing them how to simply and effectively prototype and carry out user testing.\n\nSally Shepard is an iOS developer, accessibility consultant and hardware hacker who has worked on a wide variety of award winning apps. She previously worked at Dennis Publishing as Head of App Development, working on some of the top Newsstand apps. Before the iPhone, she studied audio engineering, a field which combined her love of music and tinkering with expensive hardware.\n\nFor more on YOW!
