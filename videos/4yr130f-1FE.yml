description: "Domain-Driven Design Europe 2020\nhttp://dddeurope.com - https://twitter.com/ddd_eu\n\nFor the past decade and a half, Domain Driven Design has been giving teams the tools to successfully tackle the complexity at the heart of software. But lots of people fail when they try to put its techniques and patterns into practice, especially at scale.\n\nWhy? It can't just be because the Blue book is so thick? We're going to argue that the \"near enemies\" of DDD are to blame. Things which look like DDD, but which are in fact counterfeits that push us farther away from our goal.\n\nOur talk tells the story of a large-scale DDD implementation that got complicated. We'll talk about how took stock of the situation as we found it, how we identified where the root problems lay, how we set everyone off on a course of success, and the mistakes we made along the way.\n\nRegardless of whether you are working with serverless, microservices or a more monolithic architecture (nothing wrong there!) - this fun session is for those who want to learn the lessons of implementing DDD at scale, with a healthy dose of pitfalls and hazards to watch out for too.\n\nBio Gayathri Thiyagarajan\n\nA software engineer with over 13 years experience in Java development. I have been working on designing and developing distributed systems for the past 5 years.\nI am passionate about Domain Driven design and architecture.\n\nI have experienced first hand how much DDD can help in designing and building distributed architecture.\nI have been working as a DDD consultant for a high profile public sector client for the past year and half. I am looking forward to sharing the significant amount of knowledge I have gathered in course of that time.\n\nBio Andrew Harmel-Law\n\nA highly enthusiastic, self-starting and responsible Tech Principal; Andrew specialises in Java / JVM technologies, agile delivery, build tools and automation, and domain driven design.\n\nExperienced across the software development lifecycle and in many sectors including government, banking, and eCommerce, what motivates him is the production of large-scale software solutions, fulfilling complex client requirements. He understands that people, tooling, architecture and process all have key roles to play in achieving this.\n\nAndrew has a passion for open source software and its communities. He has been interested in and involved with OSS to a greater or lesser extent since his career began; as a user, contributor, expert group member, or paid advocate.\n\nFinally, Andrew enjoys sharing his experience as much as possible. This sharing is not only seen in his formal consulting engagements, but also informally through mentoring, blog posts, conferences (speaking and organising), and open sourcing his code."
