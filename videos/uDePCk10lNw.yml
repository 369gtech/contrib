description: "This tutorial is aimed at people new to pandas. Knowledge of Python will be useful but is not essential. JupyterLab will be used, and attendees are expected to complete short exercises during the tutorial. The tutorial will start by the basic pandas features, but it will go deep into some of the pandas implementation details, so attendees are prepared to deal with real data.\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
