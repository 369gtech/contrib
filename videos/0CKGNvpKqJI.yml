description: 'The best design is invisible, everyone tells us, and so we design products to feel easy and effortless. But what happens when we design products that require the humans who maintain them to also be invisible? Worse, what happens when we design products and don’t even consider these humans at all? This talk explores a part of the design process we don’t often think about or value: Human infrastructure, and the people who keep our systems and organisations running. - Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/amuse'
