description: "Jorge Hidalgo, Senior Technology Architect, ACCENTURE, S.L.\nJulio Palma Vazquez, Technology Architect, ACCENTURE S.L.\n\nIn the brave new world of microservices, the need for polyglot solutions is growing, making it harder to standardize continuous delivery pipelines across many different languages and runtimes. Tasks such as compiling, packaging, profiling, or verifying software components are now more diverse, and the developer tool belt does not stop growing. Thankfully, there are ways to prescribe and standardize without losing freedom and flexibility. This session showcases an architectural approach, based on real-world project experiences, that leverages the power of Jenkins, Docker, and OpenShift to continuously and easily deliver polyglot components."
