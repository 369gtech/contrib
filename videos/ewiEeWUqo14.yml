title: 'Holographic Programming – Exploring the HoloLens - Lars Klint'
recordingDate: 1489743422
description: "Virtual reality and augmented reality are terms most developers and technical enthusiasts recognize. What about “Mixed reality”? A reality that is part real world, part digital world, a reality that is enhanced with Holograms.\nMicrosoft’s HoloLens introduces users to an entirely new way of thinking about computing. Learn how to use the Holographic Development Kit (HDK) to build completely new experiences that will blow your mind (only figuratively, I hope), and get a sense for what is possible. You will be challenged to think of how to solve problems in an entirely new way that leverage holographic projections, to provide intuitive natural interactions with the digital world."
