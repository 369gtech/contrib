description: "Software Patching Needn't Be a Can of Worms\n\nPhilip Rowlands\n\nLet's face itâ€”manual patching is no fun, all toil. The solution? Better automation, better patching.\n\n\"There's no record of what third-party software/versions we use. I don't know what updates are available, and of those, which are the most important. It's hard to get downtime on production systems. There's no test environment for this. I'm scared the upgrade will break stuff, and when it does, rolling back will be even harder.\"\n\nIf these complaints ring true for your organisation, this talk chases each one away with examples of applying automation for an easier life.\n\nView the full SREcon19 Europe/Middle East/Africa Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon19emea/program \n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
