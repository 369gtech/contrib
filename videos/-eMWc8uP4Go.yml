title: 'Krys Blackwood: Calling Voyager: Interface Design for NASA’s Deep Space Network'
recordingDate: 1496250222
description: "Never been to an FITC event? We'd like to change that. Just email us at neverbeen@fitc.ca for a VERY special offer!\n\nNASA’s Deep Space Network (DSN) is one of its oldest and longest running projects. Without the DSN, we can’t talk to the legendary Voyager Spacecraft, or even Curiosity on Mars. The DSN is monitored and controlled by a steadfast group of unsung heroes who face situational awareness and vigilance challenges every day, and for whom change always introduces risk. Krys will talk about the DSN itself, and describe how the JPL Human Interface Group is using participatory and ethnographically inspired methodology to approach the challenges of innovation in a risk-averse, well-established culture.\n\nKrys Blackwood\nSenior Lead User Experience Designer, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory\nhttps://twitter.com/shodoshan\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
