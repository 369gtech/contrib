description: "Slides and more info: http://www.codemesh.io/codemesh2015/andreia-gaita\n\n\n Commercial VR devices are just around the corner, and more and more content is being created for them. This singular environment poses new and unique challenges, not the least of which is the ability of the developer to make the user physically ill. Not only do you have to worry about making your experience fun, but also about making it comfortable.\nIn this talk we'll look at the current state of VR hardware and software, and talk about the most common problems that can make a VR experience not fun - and look at great examples of excellent VR experiences. We'll talk about latency, motion sickness, cameras, shaders, movement, refresh rates, tracking, along with practical examples and tips of how to tackle these issues in game engines, using Unity as a platform.\n\n\nAbout Andreia\n\nAndreia Gaita is a C#/C++ developer and long-time open source and Mono contributor that found herself in the strange and fascinating world of game development and VR when she started working at Unity Technologies, and even though she currently works at GitHub, the fascination for game development and virtual realities continues unabated. For the past 16 years she has been involved in the development of cross-platform applications, services and libraries, embedding browser engines, creating bindings and making tools that help developers be successful. She hails from the sunny city of Lisbon, Portugal and currently lives in Copenhagen, Denmark, where she bikes a lot."
