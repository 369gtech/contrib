description: "This interview was recorded for the GOTO Book Club. #GOTOcon #GOTOBookClub\nhttp://gotopia.tech/bookclub\n\nPhil Winder - Author of \"Reinforcement Learning\" & CEO of Winder Research\nRebecca Nugent - Stephen E. and Joyce Fienberg Professor of Statistics & Data Science at Carnegie Mellon University\n\nDESCRIPTION\nReinforcement learning (RL) focuses on sequential decision making and it is significantly different from machine learning. The recommendations based on RL algorithms could help you attain your business goals faster while also increasing engagement.\nJoin Phil Winder, Author of \"Reinforcement Learning\" and CEO of Winder Research, while he is talking with Rebecca Nugent, Fienberg Professor of Statistics & Data Science at Carnegie Mellon University, about key concepts from reinforcement learning and reveals the industry applications while also focusing on why some of the fundamentals like “ problem definition”, “how to get started with RL” and the switch in risk-taking from the management level to the engineering department while software is shaping the heart of the business.\nThe interview is based on Phil's book \"Reinforcement Learning\": https://amzn.to/3t1S1VZ\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n01:25 Introduction of Rebecca & Phil\n01:57 Reinforcement learning (RL) vs machine learning (ML)\n05:20 Key terminology for RL\n12:44 RL in education\n20:35 What kind of industry applications is RL best suited for?\n26:19 Can we apply RL to long-term strategies?\n30:49 Are the people running the algorithms, running the company?\n35:54 RL and people\n40:45 Problem definition and RL\n44:35 The book\n52:15 What excites you the most about RL?\n55:18 What are the challenges with the interpretability of RL results?\n01:04:54 Applying RL algorithms to real life\n01:11:42 Thank you and goodbye Rebecca & Phil\n01:12:55 Takeaways\n01:13:35 Outro\n\nRead the full transcription of the interview here:\nhttps://gotopia.tech/bookclub/episodes/how-to-leverage-reinforcement-learning\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nPhil Winder • Reinforcement Learning • https://amzn.to/3t1S1VZ\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#ReinforcementLearning #RL #AI #ML #Programming #ArtificialIntelligence #MachineLearning #DataScience #PhilWinder #RebeccaNugent #CarnegieMellon\n\nSUPPORTER\nThis episode of the GOTO Book Club was made possible thanks to the support of GOTOpia.tech.
