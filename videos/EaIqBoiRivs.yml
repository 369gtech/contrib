Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nGraduated Project Lightning Talk: Using Trace Data for Monitoring & Alerting of Application Health, not Just Debugging - Albert Teoh\n\nTrace data is ideal for debugging slow or erroneous requests, but how can we find (and be alerted about) these problem “needles” in our “haystack” of requests within our constellation of services and endpoints? A proposal of aggregating trace data into metrics is presented; identifying statistically significant problems such as a consistently slow endpoint, then visualizing these results within Jaeger UI or Grafana."
