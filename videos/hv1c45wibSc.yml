description: "A Set of Tools for Any Kubernetes Project - Mario Manno & Venkata Krishna Rohit Sakala, SUSE\n\nIn our effort to build an operator that can deploy Cloud Foundry on Kubernetes, we've discovered several opportunities for features. We'd like to demo these capabilities to the Cloud Foundry community. These can be useful for core contributors to Cloud Foundry, but also users of Kubernetes that have encountered the same limitations as we did. Secret generation, canary deployments, server-side templates, config change detection, feature-rich jobs and more."
