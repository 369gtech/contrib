title: 'Using Python to build an AI to play and win SNES StreetFighter II - PyCon 2018'
recordingDate: 1526152744
description: "Speakers: Adam Fletcher, Jonathan Mortensen\n\n![ryu-python](http://www.thesimplelogic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/ryu-python.png)\n\nHear the story of how we used Python to build an AI that plays Super StreetFighter II on the Super NES. We'll cover how Python provided the key glue between the SNES emulator and AI, and how the AI was built with `gym`, `keras-rl` and `tensorflow`. We'll show examples of game play and training, and talk about which bot beat which bot in the bot-v-bot tournament we ran. \n\nAfter this talk you'll know how easy it is to use Python and Python's machine learning libraries to teach a computer to play games.  You'll see a practical example of the same type of machine learning used by AlphaGo, and also get to find out which character in StreetFighter II is best to pick when playing your friends.\n\n  [1]: https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Mh9uzCm4JeevMN5w-SWJgzWabrqOClAVMsa4jJtMRm-il1dP6oVTsRstJSQlbgKf4qh3A08yMZ36pwezsITA=w3230-h1786\n  [2]: http://www.thesimplelogic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/ryu-python.png\n\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2018 and https://github.com/PyCon/2018-slides"
