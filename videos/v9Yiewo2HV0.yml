description: "Many tried or at least heard of the benefits of Linux containers. Docker has become the de facto standard. However, innovation moves quickly and tools like Kubernetes and Istio appeared addressing the problem of container and application orchestration at scale. What do you know about these tools? In this presentation, we will talk about various tools of the container world, what they do and how they relate to each other. How can individual developers use them and how can they be used to build next-generation applications. There will be a mix of theory and background information, practical tips and some demos. After the talk, you will hopefully know where the container evolution is heading and whether it is worth to tag along.\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
