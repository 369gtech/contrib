description: "Europeâ€™s Leading Laravel Conference\nBlind-bird Tickets 2020 Available\nhttps://laracon.eu/2020/tickets\n\nOver the last years in my job as CTO for various companies I talked and met a lot of developers. Often these developers were good ones but only a few of them were actually really great. The talk will explore the fact that becoming a great developer is possible for everyone by learning some specific skills and behaviors. You will see that being a great developer has nothing to do with expertise or technology (language, framework, stack ..) more with how you work and communicate."
