title: 'Web Performance Tuning with browser APIs - Yaser Adel Mehraban - NDC London 2021'
language: English
recordingDate: 1624522294
description: "As web applications become more complex, with a corresponding increase in required bandwidth and bundle sizes, to meet users' expectations the need to consider web performance has never been more important.\n\nYes, there are third-party tools that can help with performance but what about what is available \"out-of-the-box\"? In this talk we will look at some of the browser APIs which can greatly assist in implementing techniques to improve web performance.\n\nFrom Network Information API, to Device Memory and Performance APIs, these are all right there in the browser and a great set of tools with which to design our apps from the ground up with performance in mind and the means to identify where we can focus to help our users."
