title: '.NET Assembly Binding Redirect'
recordingDate: 1377173004
description: 'bindingRedirect in an application configuration file (app.config) instructs .NET to probe for a new version of an assembly. Thus you can bind to new assembly version revision during assembly resolution. We define this binding via the inside the dependentAssembly element and name the dependent assembly via assemblyIdentity tag. Examples written in C#.'
