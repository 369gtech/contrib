language: English

description: "Julien Goodwin\n\nhttps://lca2021.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/104/\n\nIn 2017 I came one keypress from causing Google's main backbone to largely fall off the Internet. This is the story of how we used that incident as a learning opportunity, how a lack of buy-in hindered further improvements, and how an existing toolkit of python libraries allowed testing and validation tools to be quickly built, preventing any chance of a recurrence.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/\n\nProduced by Next Day Video Australia: https://nextdayvideo.com.au\n\n#linux.conf.au #linux #foss #opensource\n\nSat Jan 23 17:05:00 2021 at Blemings Labs"
