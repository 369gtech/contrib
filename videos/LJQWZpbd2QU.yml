title: 'The Layout Framework - Nick Lockwood'
recordingDate: 1574948761
description: 'Layout is a framework for implementing iOS user interfaces using runtime-evaluated XML template files. It is intended as a more-or-less drop-in replacement for Nibs and Storyboards, but offers a number of advantages. It''s simpler for simple layouts, more powerful for complex layouts, easier to collaborate on and debug. To make this possible Layout introduces a new node hierarchy for managing views, similar to the ''Virtual DOM'' used by React Native.'
