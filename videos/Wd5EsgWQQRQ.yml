title: 'Transient Test Environments with Octopus - Robert Wagner'
recordingDate: 1506326716
description: "If you have just a handful of interelated applications, or a whole host of microservices, creating and maintaining a realistic integration test environment can be time consuming. Would it not be great to have a new, clean, repeatable test environment for every commit?\n\nIn this session, Robert will demonstrate how to create integration test environments on the fly. He will cover how to create VM templates, create environments on demand, and deploy the right version of your dependencies, stringing it all together with Octopus Deploy and it's API. Finally he will demonstrate how to automatically deploy an application when auto-scaling occurs."
