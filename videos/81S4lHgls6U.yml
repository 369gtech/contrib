description: "Microservices for the Enterprise: Myths vs. Reality\n\nMark Tomcza, Electric Cloud, Global Devops Solutions Architect \nMarc Hornbeek, Principal Consultant - DevOps, Trace3 \n\nMicroservices offer compelling benefits for accelerating agility, flexibility, and quality. The concept of building and releasing applications based on contained, bounded architectural components is as attractive and logical as the idea of a Lego brick that can be used to build complex systems without regard to the purpose of the ultimate system itself. \n\nWhile we “dream small to go big”, the reality of microservices for enterprise use cases is not as simple. While we’re told microservices are not supposed to be dependent on each other, but often real-world services behave a bit differently... We’re told they should be easier to manage – but are they really?\n\nDecomposing monolithic legacy applications to microservices, re-architecting components of your application to be services-based, and maintaining business continuity of services comprised of multiple micro-components -- all come with unique challenges. From unavoidable dependencies no one tells you about, testing challenges, monitoring, and tooling – this talk covers some of the myths we often hear about microservices, and how these play out IRL for enterprise applications. We share some “gotchas” to keep in mind and proven patterns to help organizations get the most of moving to microservices.\n\nDOES17 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
