description: "Industrial IoT has been around for a lot longer than most people think, predating the consumer internet of things. Its early incarnations were originally called M2M, or machine-to-machine, networks. These early systems were always networks of wired machines communicating via Ethernet, Fiber, DSL or even twisted copper pair landlines over a modem. \n\nWired systems require a significant infrastructure to be in place, which is why most modern-day systems are centered around manufacturing or industrial automation. What about remote facilities that are not connected to a fiber network, or where a communication network is prohibitively expensive? What about things that are in motion, like automobiles, freight trucks and rail? What about small sensor devices that are battery-powered and now being deployed for asset tracking, or for environmental and agricultural needs?\n\nIn this talk, Brian will explain the differences between Low Power Wide Area Networks and Cellular IoT, and how to use them when deploying a real-world IoT solution in the wild, whether it is for remote wind and solar farms, rail, smart power poles, or real-time asset tracking for supply chain.\n\nMore details here: https://codesync.global/speaker/bryan-hughes/"
