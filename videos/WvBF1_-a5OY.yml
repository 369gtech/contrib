description: "Ahh… CSS and performance. Two of Harry’s favourite things! But how well do they play together? It depends…\n\nIn this very matter-of-fact talk, he’ll be looking at all of the different ways CSS can make our websites faster or slower. From the common and perhaps more obvious, to the unusual and obscure ways in which CSS can impact performance for better or worse.\n\nHarry Roberts\nConsultant Front-End Architect, CSS Wizardry Ltd.\nhttps://twitter.com/csswizardry\nhttps://www.instagram.com/csswizardry/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/csswizardryltd\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/csswizardry\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/csswizardry\nhttps://github.com/csswizardry\nhttps://dribbble.com/csswizardry\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc\n\nSave 10% off any FITC event with discount code 'youtube'.\nSee our upcoming events at www.fitc.ca"
