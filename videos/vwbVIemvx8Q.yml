description: "Tomek Polanski, Software Developer, Groupon\n\nI CONVINCED GROUPON TO FLUTTER. DO SAME WITH YOUR COMPANY!\n\nFlutter is a new cross-platform mobile application solution from Google. While its touted benefits like the speed and the simplicity to create cross-platform applications sound appealing and you might be keen to adopt it, your team might be hesitant to adopt it because of perceptions of risk and uncertainty as the solution for your real-world app. I will tell my story about how I convinced my team at Groupon to try out Flutter. How highlighting the benefits, whilst being fully transparent about the risks will strengthen your argument.\nNext, we will help you address your team’s concerns; starting with fellow developers through to management. I will share how to get the whole team onboard, by showing your:\nDesigners; how to make a beautiful application\nQA; how to make your application more robust\nDevelopers; how easy and captivating is to use Flutter\nProduct owners; that Flutter is feasible for product goals\nFinally, I will share some of the challenges while integrating Google’s cross-platform framework into an already existing application and how we tackled them.\nAfter the talk, you should know if your team would benefit from Flutter, and if it does - how you can convince your colleagues."
