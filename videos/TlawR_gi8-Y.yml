description: "PyData DC 2018\n\nProcessing data is hard. Building a robust system for data processing is even harder. This talk examines how data engineering has been impacted by the demands of modern data science architectures. We’ll use real-world examples gathered as a PMC member of Apache Airflow to motivate a discussion of best practices for building robust data pipelines.\n===\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
