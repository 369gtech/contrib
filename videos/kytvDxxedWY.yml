Although it is unfair to compare them directly, this talk aims to provide a clear comparison with a pre-defined criteria applied to a specific use-case. \nWriting a simulation engine is very similar to writing a game engine and requires certain features from a language or framework.\nPossible comparison criteria: \n1. Performance\n2. Simplicity\n3. Amount of code necessary for a MVP\n4. Utilities: docs, tests, profile\n5. Compatibility\n\nTl;dr\nDo I want to go back to Python after Rust?
