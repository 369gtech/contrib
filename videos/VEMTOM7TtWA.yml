recordingDate: 1605679219
description: "Azure Skåne User Group is happy to invite you to another great session covering Azure DevOps, this time about how the IT Pro can excel with the tools.\n\nAzure DevOps is a great tool for software development processes and deployment. But what about the IT Pro? Azure DevOps has been developed into a product that can provide great use for teams of IT Pro's when working with PowerShell, ARM Templates and Azure Resources. It can take your daily work from a few scripts on your local drive to an enterprise solution that is auditable, secure and well documented.\n\nIn this session, we will take a look at the possibilities that Azure DevOps has to offer if you are an IT Pro that uses automation. We will see the options for teamwork, the different kind of connections with Azure and the use cases for cloud engineers familiar with PowerShell or Infrastructure as Code. With some practical demo's, real world examples and guidance you will be able to get started yourself right after the session.\n___________________________\nFoo Café is a meeting place for people with an interest in software development and IT. \nHere, user groups and partner companies find the perfect atmosphere for sharing knowledge and develop competence. \nFoo Café is open for everyone and is free to attend.
