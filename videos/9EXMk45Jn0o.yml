description: "A Google TechTalk, 4/11/17, presented by Eva Bacon, TJ Varghese, Nick Miceli, Lucy Bourne\nABSTRACT: Googlers spend millions of hours every year in meetings. Google CorpEng seeks to \"empower Googlers with world-leading technology\", and even a small improvement to the productivity of meetings results in big wins. When a team at G Suite first proposed Jamboard, a new collaborative digital whiteboard, there was an obvious overlap of the value this could bring to Google as well as the rest of the world's enterprises. We'll share the Jamboard story, the problems it solves, and how CorpEng helped develop, test, innovate, and incubate the future of collaboration with the Jamboard team."
