description: "\"New day, new framework\". How to handle this?\n\nI follow front-end trends and I want to share my thoughts on them. Both experienced front-end developers and the beginners, expecting a quick summary, should find something valuable for them in my talk.\n\nWhat are the main front-end players? Is Vue more popular than React? Can we use some kind of a common, framework-independent code? What are the trends and what is the future of JavaScript? I will do my best to address these questions in an entertaining way.\n\nThe speech took place on 8th of May on Fullstack Stage during Infoshare 2019 in Gdansk, Poland.\n\n#Trends #Front-end #FullStack #Tech"
