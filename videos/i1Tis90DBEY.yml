description: "http://www.Cppcon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2015\n—\nWe will be presenting on the evolution of a legacy monitoring subsystem modernized to C++11 with enhanced interfaces and better programming techniques. The presentation will cover some abstracted example problem areas, the solutions, and talk about the strategy employed to modernize the code.\n— \nRachel Cheng: Software Engineer, F5 Networks\n\nMichael VanLoon: Principal Software Engineer, F5 Networks\nI have been developing software for over 30 years. Yes, I started before I was born. I have been doing C++ for over 20 years, not very well at first, and slightly better now.\n\nI work at F5 Networks, and have worked at Disney, VMware, Yahoo!, and Microsoft, among many others. I have benefited from a wide range of experience and personalities.\n\nI have a personal grudge against code that does not strive to reach a high standard. I am dismayed at code that does not reach its potential. And I firmly believe that writing code well creates a better, more stable, more maintainable product.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
