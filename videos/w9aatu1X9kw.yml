description: "Disaster Recovery for Kubernetes Just Got Easier - Michael Rhodes, Dell EMC\n\nIn this talk we will walk through the value of running services in Kubernetes clusters, how they can be integrated quickly into Cloud Foundry, (via the Open Service Broker API), and how you can use a new OSB API extensions model called “Actions” to offer up backup & restore utilities to your end users. Pair all of this with Dell EMC Data Domain to reduce the transfer and storage size of backup data and you have a solid production data service story.\n\nThis topic is especially relevant with the release of Kubernetes persistent volumes there has been a shift in the way that data services are being deployed to production. Service Providers can choose from an endless number of open source components and get an (almost) production ready database up and running in kubernetes very quickly. With help from the Open Service Broker API and its extensions enhancement, Cloud Foundry Administrators can integrate kubernetes backed services into their platforms and give their users additional tools for managing instances, such as backup and restore. \n\nAbout Michael Rhodes\nMichael Rhodes is a Cloud Native Architect in Dell EMCs Data Protection Division.
