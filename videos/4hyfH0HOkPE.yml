title: 'YOW! Lambda Jam 2016 Rob Howard - A Whirlwind Tour of PureScript'
recordingDate: 1465604057
description: "This talk and (and subsequent Workshop / Jam) will introduce you to PureScript, a strongly-typed, Haskell-inspired programming language that compiles to JavaScript. The talk will provide a tour of the language and its ecosystem of tooling and libraries. You should leave both sessions with a grasp of PureScript fundamentals, and a self-sufficiency to tackle your own projects and experiments.\n\nTalk Prerequisites: Basic programming experience; the talk is explicitly targeted at a range of experience levels. A familiarity with Haskell and JavaScript will help you understand more of the talk, but is not a strict requirement.\n\nRob is a web developer who hops between Haskell, JavaScript and PureScript at Ambiata. Heâ€™d like nothing more than to make functional programming more accessible, and to encourage programming communities to learn more from each other. Rob likes coffee purely to spite his tea-loving colleagues.\n\nFor more on YOW! Lambda Jam, visit http://lambdajam.yowconference.com.au"
