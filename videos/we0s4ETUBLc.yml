description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nGo? Bash! Meet the Shell-operator - Andrey Klimentyev & Dmitry Stolyarov, Flant \n\nWhile using Kubernetes, the need to automate our work is everpresent. Usually, the task boils to a simple pattern: subscribe to Kubernetes resource changes and acting upon them. In the simplest case, a ConfigMap creation will suffice. In the complex one, interaction with a Custom Resource might be required.  Most of the operations engineers know a scripting language (e.g., bash) and are familiar with the jq tool, which employs an indigenous paradigm of traversing JSON structures inspired by the functional programming paradigm.  A general-purpose programming language, without a doubt, provides tons of benefits, but do they not create a steep learning curve on the path to automating and extending Kubernetes?  This talk focuses on writing simple operators with the shell-operator, using a scripting language (bash) and jq, and justifies such an approach.\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zeo1"
