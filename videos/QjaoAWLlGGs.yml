description: "Recorded at SpringOne Platform 2016.\n\nIn this talk we'll cover the host of new features that have been added to Spring Boot 1.4 to help with testing. We'll discuss how to unit test your code, how (and when) to involve Spring in your tests, and talk about the various tools and libraries that you should be using. Taking a simple application, we're going to add: - Unit tests for basic components - Integration Tests for JPA entities and queries - Tests for JSON marshalling and unmarshalling - Tests for Spring MVC controllers - Tests for remote RestTemplate calls (using mocking) - End-to-end integration tests (hitting a real HTTP endpoint) Well also look a little bit at the internals of Spring's testing support and pick apart how the magic actually works."
