description: "Web technologies have become the default way to develop data visualizations: they are easy to use, convenient to debug and work across all kinds of devices. And thanks to ever-faster smartphones even they have become a valid platform for web-based visualizations - but creating something decent for them requires a whole new set of skills.\n\nIn this talk, I will present a quick run-through of all the relevant aspects of mobile web-based datavis: * What graphics technology (Canvas, SVG, WebGL) to choose? * How to include all the neat HTML5-supported sensors to do cool stuff (GPS, device orientation)? * What amazing things can be done with multi-touch input? * What changes for information and chart design? * How to best debug mobile visualizations?\n\nTranscript/Slides at: http://2014.jsconf.eu/speakers/dominikus-baur-webbased-data-visualization-on-mobile-devices.html\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
