description: "3Blue1Brown aka Grant Sanderson is an outstanding math animation artist, scholar, & educator. In this episode, I ask him about his workflow, the tools he uses, the nature of consciousness, machine learning, & so much more!  Grant studied mathematics at Stanford as an undergraduate, then became a multivariable calculus fellow for KhanAcademy through their talent search program. He started making math animation videos on Youtube in 2015, and has since amassed over 2 million subscribers. It was a wonderful conversation, and I hope you enjoy it! \n\n0:41 Intro\n2:40 Trip to India\n6:00 Grant’s Animation Tool: Manim\n8:54 Siraj’s experience with Manim\n14:33 Grant’s thoughts on Manim documentation\n17:14 Other math animation tools\n18:50 The Evolution of Grant’s creative process\n25:46 Techniques to read math papers\n28:40 Machine Learning\n30:00 Grant’s musical tastes\n31:05 Data Science\n33:10 Grant’s parents\n35:40 Immigrant parents\n37:50 A problem that stumped Grant\n40:47 The nature of consciousness \n45:50 Richard Feynman\n49:00 Siraj’s current theory of consciousness\n54:00 Impactful books\n57:55 Next steps for Grant\n59:07 Qualms with Youtube\n1:04:14 Fears \n1:08:21 Controversial opinions  \n\nINSTAGRAM: https://bit.ly/312pLUb\nFACEBOOK: https://bit.ly/2OqOhx1\nTWITTER: https://bit.ly/2OHYLbB\nWEBSITE: https://bit.ly/2OoVPQF\n\nFind my podcast on these sites:\nAnchor: https://anchor.fm/sirajraval\niTunes: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/siraj-raval-podcast/id1468351190?ign-mpt=uo%3D4\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/2Zmsffv\nBreaker: https://www.breaker.audio/siraj-raval-podcast\nPocket Cast: https://pca.st/7cU2 \nRadio Public: https://d12xoj7p9moygp.cloudfront.net/images/podcast/logo-square/006/radiopublic.png \nStitcher: \nhttps://www.stitcher.com/podcast/anchor-podcasts/siraj-raval-podcast\n\nGrant's Youtube channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw\n\nGrant's Twitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/3blue1brown\n\nMathematics of Machine Learning:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8onB7rPG4Pk\n\nHow to Learn Mathematics Fast:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzfdL58virc\n\nJoin us in the Wizards Slack channel:\nhttp://wizards.herokuapp.com/\n\nHit the Join button above to sign up to become a member of my channel for access to exclusive live streams!\n\nJoin us at the School of AI:\nhttps://theschool.ai/\n\nSignup for my newsletter for exciting updates in the field of AI:\nhttps://goo.gl/FZzJ5w\n\nAnd please support me on Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/user?u=3191693"
