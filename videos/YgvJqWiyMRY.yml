description: 'As Clojure programmers, our software is full of trees. Both the values we manipulate and the code we manipulate them with, are made from trees. It''s all to easy to get caught up in a project and miss the forest for the trees, but how often have you missed the trees for the forest? This talk is an exploration of trees from a unique perspective that will hopefully inform your thinking and lead your program design out of the woods.'
