description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nPanel Discussion: Marketing as Code: How to Rock Out with Non-Code Contributions - Bart Farrell, Data on Kubernetes Community; Kunal Kushwaha, Civo; Kaslin Fields, Google; Matt Broberg, Red Hat; Chris Short, Red Hat\n\nFor new folks in the CNCF space, becoming a contributor may sound daunting, and even overwhelming. But guess what? There are tons of ways to contribute apart from code. 5 members of the Contibex Marketing working group (Kunal, Bart, Chris, Kaslin, and Matt) are all participating and contributing through positive attitudes, documentation, networking, videos, drawings, and even raps. They want to share the welcoming spirit of the CNCF where no contribution is too small, and everyone will have something to share. Contributors' stories must be heard, and that's where the upstream marketing team comes in. (This proposal is for the Students' track)"
