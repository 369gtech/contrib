description: "In this talk, we will look into what it means for a company when there is a security issue in a piece of software. This talk will provide suggestions on who needs to get involved.\nWe live in a world of technology and engineering. Almost everything around us requires software. Unfortunately, the software we use or build has bugs. While most bugs can be fixed, there are these other types of bugs, called vulnerabilities, that cause headaches and haunt us at night. Security issues can be found in our own infrastructure, on customers' infrastructure, or — worse — around user data. It is on us as engineers to do the best we can to not make security issues in the first place. But it is on everybody involved in a product to provide communication, guidance, and support when an issue exists.\n\nAbout Markus Holtermann\nMarkus Holtermann works as a back-end and infrastructure engineer at Crate.io. For a decade, he has been a member of several Open Source communities and gained experience in communication, community management, engineering, and security by taking on various tasks. Markus has been a project lead at the German ubuntuusers.de community support platform, he is a member of the security team for the Django web framework, as well as an organizer and advisor for DjangoCon conferences. In his free time, Markus is a hobby photographer."
