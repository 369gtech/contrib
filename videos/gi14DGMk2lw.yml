description: "https://media.ccc.de/v/ASG2018-208-dbus-broker\n\nStatus update\n\ndbus-broker is an implementation of the DBus specification, intended to be a drop-in replacement for the reference implementation on Linux. It is now scheduled to be the default system and user bus in the next Fedora release. This talks shows some of the lessons learned during this relatively young project, the challenges faced, what the current status is and the plans for the future.\n\n\n\nTom Gundersen David Herrmann\n\nhttps://cfp.all-systems-go.io/en/ASG2018/public/events/208"
