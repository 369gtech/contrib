recordingDate: 1592325002
description: "# Better mental health and wellbeing literacy for developers\n\nNicholas Walsh - Lecturer\n\nRecent surveys have report that 66% of tech workers report feeling stressed by their work; 52% have suffered from anxiety and depression; and tech workers are 5x more depressed than the UK population. Findings are especially pronounced for neurodivergent groups (diagnosed with dyslexia, dyspraxia, ADHD, Autism etc.).\n\nIn this talk I will provide an overview of current thinking on mental health and wellbeing based on contemporary research. This will cover, how mental health phenomena is conceptualised, assessed, classified, caused, treated and the underlying brain mechanisms. I will also outline some general steps that individuals can take to improve their own wellbeing for themselves and their organisations. By increasing mental health literacy, I hope individuals will be better informed to create a more enjoyable and productive working environment.\n\n## About nor(DEV):con\n\nThe eastern region's biggest tech conference runs annually in February with a fantastic line-up of speakers and workshops.
