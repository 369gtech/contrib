I will also provide tips and tricks on how to increase the success of such projects. The second part of the talk will be about 2 open-source python projects I've created, as well as a project I'm working on regarding the trading of cryptocurrency... and their relation to machine learning. Specifically, the challenges and findings in making these cases work will be explored.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2018.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
