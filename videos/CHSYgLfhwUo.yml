description: "Ryan Boland on Embedded Programming for Quadcopters\n\nRyan tells us how he built a drone from scratch, including which components you'll need and how the code works to keep the copter flying.\n\nWe lost audio for 2 minutes. It was cut out, but if anything isn't clear because of this, we're sorry. It's still full of great information.\n\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/ryanboland18/quad-stripped\n\nPresented at Code & Supply in Pittsburgh, PA. Learn more at http://www.codeandsupply.co"
