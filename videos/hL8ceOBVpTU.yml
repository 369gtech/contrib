title: '"Opening a treasure trove: The Historical Aerial Photography project" - Paul Haesler (LCA 2020)'
recordingDate: 1579213042
description: "Paul Haesler\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/213/\n\nGeoscience Australia (GA) is the custodian of a significant collection of national aerial photography, curated by GA and its predecessor agencies. The data extends over 70 years, from the 1920s through to the mid-1990s. This archive represents an important resource for understanding Australiaâ€™s changing landscape as the majority of the collection predates high resolution satellite imagery.\r\n\r\nDigitisation of this archive is an ongoing priority as some of the original negatives are now very old and starting to degrade; but the approximately 280,000 images digitised so far are currently difficult to discover and access.\r\n\r\nSimilar but smaller archives of aerial photography are maintained by various state government agencies, and some are quite mature in their adoption of digital discovery and access, however each agency has implemented their own system, generally locked to a proprietary platform with little capacity for federating data across agencies.\r\n\r\nGA has therefore partnered with Data-61 under the Platforms for Open Data (PfOD) program to design and build a canonical metadata repository for images in the collection, and an open API for discovering and eventually accessing these images.  The project has a strong focus on open source and standards based solutions, with the hope that state government agencies will come on board, facilitating federated discovery of imagery across state and federally managed archives.\r\n\r\nThe project is a fascinating example of old technology meeting new, dealing with metadata sourced from nearly century-old hand-written documents on the one hand, and the latest cloud deployment technologies and emerging API standards for geospatial data discovery on the other.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
