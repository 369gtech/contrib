title: 'Glenn Vanderburg of LivingSocial on why software development is an engineering discipline'

description: "Watch more from the O'Reilly Software Architecture Conference: http://goo.gl/lXpXnG\n\nI believe strongly that software development is, incontrovertibly, an engineering discipline (albeit still an immature one). But a great many people in our field have decided that it’s not. I think this is a harmful mistake.\n\nBut it’s also a natural one, because most programmers have at least a passing familiarity with a body of knowledge known as “software engineering”—a body of knowledge that was taken very seriously for 30 years or so, but which has now been thoroughly discredited. If “software engineering” doesn’t work, then why would anyone say that software development is engineering?\n\nThis talk makes the case for software as engineering, and shows that it fits comfortably into the spectrum of engineering disciplines. The talk also explains why the software engineering field spent so long going down an incorrect path, and how we might correct that.\n\nAbout Glenn Vanderburg (LivingSocial):\nGlenn Vanderburg works at LivingSocial as the engineering director for architecture and core services.\n\nFor more information, visit: http://oreil.ly/1Cyt9nt\nSoftware architecture is a massive multidisciplinary subject, covering many roles and responsibilities, which makes it challenging to teach because so much context is required for every subject. It's also a fast-moving discipline, where entire suites of best practices become obsolete overnight.\n\nThe O'Reilly Software Architecture Conference is a new event designed to provide the necessary professional training that software architects and aspiring software architects need to succeed. A unique event, it covers the full scope of a software architect's job, from IT to leadership and business skills. It also provides a forum for networking and hearing what other professionals have learned in real-world experiences.\n\nStay Connected to O'Reilly Media by Email - http://goo.gl/YZSWbO\nFollow O'Reilly Media:\nhttp://plus.google.com/+oreillymedia\nhttps://www.facebook.com/OReilly\nhttps://twitter.com/OReillyMedia"
