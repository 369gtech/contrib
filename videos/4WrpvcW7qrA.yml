However, it's still not convenient for especially newbies to run in some closed environment or debug when some tests fail. This presentation will share experiences on running and debugging conformance tests, as well as ongoing sub-projects relevant to k8s conformance WG, etc. \n\nTo learn more click here:  https://sched.co/FuLS"
