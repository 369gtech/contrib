description: "Cheuk Ting Ho\n\nhttps://2020.pycon.org.au/program/VLPJZL\n\nAt the start, we will be using `dir` to look into the secret functions Python objects have. Eg:\r\n`__getitem__`, `__iter__` and `__next__` Then, we will investigate where is the dunder function goes? Why is it not accessible. And at the end, we will see how dunder functions can change the identity of the Python objects.\r\n\r\nThis talk is for attendees who have just begin their Python journey. By explaining the dunder functions and the nature of Python objects, attendees will have a better understanding of why Python is fundamentally different from other programming languages. Hopefully, this knowledge will help them out when they continue their Python journeys.\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, PyConline\n\nSat Sep  5 13:35:00 2020 at Obvious"
