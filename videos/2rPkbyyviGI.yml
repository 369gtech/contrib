recordingDate: 1445964178
description: "Our vision with Brillo is to bring the simplicity and speed of software development to hardware by joining together three things. First, an OS based on Android. Second, core services that enable a great getting started experience and allow you to operate at scale. Third, a developer kit with tools to build, test, and debug your solution. Watch this video for a quick overview of these major components and how they work together to quickly move from prototype to production, and manage at scale with over the air (OTA) updates, metrics, and crash reporting\n\nLearn more about Brillo - http://developers.google.com/brillo"
