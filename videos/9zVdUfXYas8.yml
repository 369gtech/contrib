description: "Filmed at http://js-kongress.de on November 28-29 in Munich\n\nIn this talk I will show how JavaScript can be used to build IoT applications that run on Linux-based devices like the Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone, UDOO or Galileo and that connect sensors, devices and cloud services.\n\nI will start with a brief overview of macchina.io, then demonstrate some of the APIs available to JavaScript developers to access different kinds of sensors and devices. Finally, I will compare macchina.io with other JavaScript toolkits and explain how JavaScript in macchina.io is different from node.js, despite both using the same JavaScript engine, V8."
