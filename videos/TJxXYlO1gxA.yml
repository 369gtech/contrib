description: "Do you believe that more than 80% of web traffic in China comes from mobile devices?\nWe live in an era where people don’t bother opening their personal computers for browsing anymore. Because of this, the performance of the website or web applications has never been more important.\n\nJoin me in this talk and we will go through what I do to speed up the applications I work on, why I do it, and the tools I use to optimise front-end performance. We will look at minimising requests, using resource compression, page rendering and some other techniques which are crucial to consider for fine tuning your applications’ performance.\n\nIt is going to be fun and I am sure you would take home some tips and tricks to keep you busy for a while, and once applied, you start hearing some wows and awesome feedback.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcsydney.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
