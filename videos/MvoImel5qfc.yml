description: "Kubernetes Networking at Scale - Laurent Bernaille, Datadog & Bowei Du, Google \n\nRunning large Kubernetes clusters serving high volumes of traffic (thousands of nodes serving thousands of requests/second) requires tackling scaling challenges in both the control plane and data plane. This talk will present options that allow for performant networking when the number of nodes, services, endpoints and traffic grow in your Kubernetes cluster. Laurent and Manjot will cover how to use CNI plugins for efficient routing by not requiring overlays, how kube-proxy can be configured to handle clusters with thousands of services and endpoint and how ingress controllers can route traffic directly to pods without requiring nodeports. In addition, many of these solutions are at an early stage and the talk will dive into the issues faced and how they were addressed. Finally, the talk will discuss upcoming technologies that will allow Kubernetes to scale even further. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPch"
