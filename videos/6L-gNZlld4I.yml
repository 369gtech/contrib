With new APIs like service worker, Push Notifications, background sync, Homescreen icons, PWAs can deliver a matching experience to most native apps. They load quickly, even on flaky networks, can re-engage with users by sending web push notifications and load as top-level, full screen experiences. Learn about these APIs and what it takes to build some of the core pieces of a PWA experience and deliver a super engaging experience with PWAs.\n\nPrateek Bhatnagar\nI am a UX Engineer at Google India.
