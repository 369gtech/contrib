title: 'Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs: Cloud Surprises for the Java Developer (Holly Cummins, 2019)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1636122461
description: "The Cloud. Everyone’s either already there or moving there. What makes the cloud so desirable? … And what can go wrong on the journey there? (Short version: monsters with big teeth. Longer version: Security, elasticity, the long leg of the legacy, business processes, portability, price models, and provisioning.)\n\nGiven that getting to the cloud isn’t trivial (at least not in a way that gets the full benefits of the cloud), are there particular challenges for Java developers trying to get to the cloud? In this talk, Holly will talk through some of the surprises on the road to cloud and describe strategies for getting round some of the monsters with big teeth.\n\nWatch thousands more tech talks in our SkillsCast library at https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts"
