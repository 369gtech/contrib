description: "Right now we are experincing a drive towards encryption on the web that's larger than anything we've seen in history. With this comes the rise of new security standards that are designed to help us better deploy, monitor and maintain our secure sites.\n\nThis is what the bleeding-edge looks like.We're going to look at standards like CAA and CT that give us massive transparency around the ecosystem we operate in while SameSite Cookies and Cookie Prefixes could alleviate technical burdens and completely neutralise threats like CSRF. With real-time monitoring thanks to OCSP Expect-Staple we can monitor our site and determine how prepared we are for new features like OCSP Must-Staple that are currently on the horizon.\n\n\nNote: Due to technical issues there is no picture from the stage until 5:13."
