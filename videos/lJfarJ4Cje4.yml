title: 'Reactive Architectures with Spencer Gibb'
language: English
recordingDate: 1591805243
description: "As more applications are experiencing the benefits of using a reactive programming model, one of the biggest problems they experience is the mismatch between Reactive Stream back pressure and current networking protocols. The RSocket protocol enables Reactive Streams back pressure to be transmitted across a network link connecting reactive flows in multiple applications to directly affect one another in a positive way.\n\nIn this talk, we will provide an overview of the key differences and benefits of RSocket-based networking and introduce the RSocket Routing project and the integration with Spring. We will discuss the benefits of this integration, including the impact on speed, scalability, security, and more. We will also discuss use cases, and show how you can leverage this new technology in your applications.\n\n---\n\nSpencer Gibb is a software engineer at VMware focusing on Spring Cloud. Spencer’s interests include distributed systems, JVM languages, web services frameworks, message-driven architectures, and making software development simpler. He loves to create software to solve a pain point (for example, by creating a tool to automate workstation setup in his free time). Spencer’s industry experience has taken him from early e-commerce platforms to government and nonprofit organizations to business intelligence startups. He has extensive experience in Java and other languages such as Scala and Python. His database experience runs from Oracle and MySQL to Riak and Cassandra."
