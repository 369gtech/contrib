title: '"Panfrost: Open Source meets Arm Mali GPUs" - Robert Foss (LCA 2020)'
recordingDate: 1579132546
description: "Robert Foss\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/68/\n\nOver the past years support for the different Arm Mali series of GPUs has been crystalizing in the Open Source space.\r\n\r\nThe first few steps towards supporting some Arm GPUs hardware were taken in 2012, and was aimed towards the low-end Mali 2/400 series of GPUs.\r\nWhile this work showed that it was indeed possible to create an Open Source driver, it would be a long time until the Lima driver actually materialized.\r\n\r\nVery much unlike the Open Source driver for the Mali 2/400 series of GPUs, support for the Mali-T and Mali-G series started to be looked at only in 2017. Since then development has progressed at a furious pace. The mesa driver, Panfrost, has now been merged and provides initial support for the T700 and T800 series of GPUs based on the Midgard architecture.\r\n\r\nIn this talk Robert will walk you through the process of creating a driver for a new GPU, from reverse engineering to upstreaming and then finally shipping a new Open Source driver.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
