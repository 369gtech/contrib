description: "Logic programming is perhaps underappreciated compared to its declarative sibling, Functional Programming. In this lightning talk, we will examine a logic programming DSL built on top of microKanren in Scala. \n\nWe will demonstrate it's expressive power by using it to help us find the solution(s) to a particularly mind-bending variant of a classic puzzle. The goal is to show that we can solve problems relationally yet write what feels like idiomatic, functional Scala.\n\nTalk by Stewart Stewart\nMarch 4th, 2016"
