title: 'Compromising the Tesla Model X Keyless Entry'
language: English
recordingDate: 1631725825
description: "This talk covers a practical security evaluation of the Tesla Model X keyless entry system. We will cover the internal workings of the system, including the key fob, the body control module and the pairing protocol. Additionally, we detail our reverse engineering techniques and document several security issues. The identified issues in the key fob firmware update mechanism and the key fob pairing protocol allow us to bypass all of the cryptographic security measures put in place. Our proof-of-concept attack allows to unlock and start a Model X in a matter of minutes. The vulnerability in the key fob firmware update mechanism was fixed by Tesla using an OTA update.\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).
