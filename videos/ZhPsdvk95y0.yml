recordingDate: 1474443315
description: "Do you write Bash, BAT, Python, Ruby, Perl, Lua scripts for system administration and scripting purposes? Stop! You don't have too. Since JVM ecosystem has a perfect answer - Groovy. With the release of version 2.3, Groovy is a mature and stable language that can be employed to deploy small scripts or to build large, mission-critical applications.\nThis talk focuses on some less-known features of the language that are going to make the life of a Java/Groovy developer more fun than ever.\nIn particular, this presentation will cover system administrator scripting toolkit that developers can take full advantage of: I/O operations, mini-DSLs, comparison to other languages like Python and Bash.\nBeing part of various projects where several scripting languages were involved without good purpose, I can share experience on how to use Groovy and leverage Java knowledge to implement different support scripts using Groovy language features."
