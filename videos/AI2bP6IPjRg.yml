description: "Reactive Desktop Applications using React, LevelDB and Electron \n\nElectron has become the de facto standard for writing desktop applications using web standards like JavaScript, HTML and CSS. With all the well known web stack, it's not just another web target though, although it's very similar it is really to be treated as a new environment. The interesting part we're going to focus on is what that means for working with data and databases, how overthinking our current web assumptions can yield us great results in simplicity, efficiency and reliability. You're going to be surprised how simple it can be to implement something like a real time chat-like application! ReactJS and LevelDB are a perfect match for this approach due to their reactive nature, pluggability and flexibility. Come join me!"
