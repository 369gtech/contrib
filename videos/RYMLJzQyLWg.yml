The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nIdentity Bootstrapping in Multi-tenant Multi-cluster Kubernetes - Manish Mehta, Volterra & Derek Suzuki, The Voleon Group  \n\nWith the increasing popularity of Kubernetes, providing managed K8s has been a great way to convert enthusiasts into adopters. However, current solutions mainly focus on providing isolated clusters and adopters are responsible for making workload identities work across clusters. If multi-tenancy is added to the mix, the challenges of bootstrapping identities that work across clusters - but within tenancy - are even greater.  In this presentation, Manish Mehta will share challenges of securely bootstrapping identities in such a setup (especially when the individual clusters could be running in untrusted environments), the tradeoffs, and possible solutions. Manish will also introduce planned open-source components of a solution used by Volterra Edge Services for identity bootstrapping and other security services. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UaZW"
