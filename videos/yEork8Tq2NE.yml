description: "RubyConf 2018 - No Title Required: How Leadership Can Come From Anywhere by Jim Liu\n\nThink you can't take on a leadership role because you're too junior? Because you're in a remote office? Because you don't have \"manager\" in your title?\n\nThe truth is that all of these blockers (and more) are artificial. How do I know this? Because over the past 6 months, I could answer yes to all three of the questions above. At the same time, I was able to co-lead the engineering effort on one of the most complex parts of our company's product. We'll explore how to bridge the gap between that title you wish you had versus the impact you can actually have."
