title: '"Overcoming the limitations of the POSIX shell command language" - Curtis Millar (LCA 2021 Online)'
recordingDate: 1612053633
description: "Curtis Millar\n\nhttps://lca2021.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/32/\n\nShell scripts in all their incarnations have been the go-to for constructing portable glue that interacts with other scripts and programs. With the evolution of UNIX, the introduction of the POSIX Shell Command Language gave us a standardised shell language the is the most common mechanism for distributing code to operate in the most diverse of situations.\r\n\r\nWhilst many shell implementations extend upon this standard to make it more usable, this talk will see how we can produce more expressive programming primitives to allow for truly composable and portable shell scripts, showing what the true power of the POSIX shell standard is, where the pain points lie, and why this standard is ultimately restricted in what it can provide.\r\n\r\nGiven the amount of effort required to make shell scripts that are both portable and reusable, we'll also discuss when you should reach for a shell script and when its best to reach for something more powerful, even if that power brings problems of its own.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
