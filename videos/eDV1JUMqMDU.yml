description: "At this conference, no doubt we're going to learn all about what's coming in Java 9, and it's so much more than just Jigsaw. But what we're really wondering is, will it change the way we develop, like Java 8 did? Will my tools break when I try to use it? Is it worth playing with it before it comes out, or should I just wait until everything stabilises?\n\nIn this talk, Trisha will take a look at the features in Java 9, demonstrate, via live coding, using the new features in IntelliJ IDEA, talk a bit about the current and future support for Java 9 in IntelliJ IDEA, and look to the near future to see how Java 9 may impact our day to day development.\n\nTrisha has developed Java applications for a range of industries, including finance, manufacturing, software and non-profit, for companies of all sizes. She has expertise in Java high performance systems, is passionate about enabling developer productivity, and dabbles with Open Source development. Trisha is a leader of the Sevilla Java User Group and a Java Champion, she believes community and sharing ideas helps us learn from mistakes and build on successes. She’s a Developer Advocate for JetBrains, which means she gets to share all the interesting things she’s constantly discovering."
