description: "Visit the largest developers congress in Europe: WeAreDevelopers World Congress, 16 - 18 May 2018 in Vienna, Austria.\n\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/congress/\n\nFor more than 200 years we put identities on parchment paper and plastics – now we work on dematerialization of identity. Step one: creating the first integrated, secure, and user-friendly ID-solution for public use.\n\nStep two: adding artificial intelligence and creating decentralized personal identity bots that keep track of your most personal information. \n\nStep three: before the decline of the smartphone kicks in, prepare IDs for the new form factors: self-grown biochip, full integration to ubiquity-systems, and legacy glasses devices.\n\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/wearedevelopers.org/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/wearedevs/\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/wearedevelopers.org/"
