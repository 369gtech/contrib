recordingDate: 1572897600
description: "High-performance, low-cost computer vision (https://aka.ms/IoTShow/Deepstream) at the intelligent edge is here! During this IoT Show, you will watch Emmanuel Bertrand, Senior Program Manager, Azure IoT Edge product team, demo an NVIDIA Jetson Nano device analyzing eight HD video streams to extract information real-time. After viewing this demo, you will be able to use NVIDIA DeepStream with Azure IoT Edge to run your own AI models across multiple cameras in the most efficient way possible. The Jetson Nano device is ideal for RSTP cameras deployed in the fieldâ€”simply add an edge device and transform your cameras into sensors to detect critical data in retail stores, warehouses, manufacturing facilities, connected buildings, construction sites, urban infrastructure and other environments.\n\n#iot #azureiot #nvidiadeepstream"
