In this demo we will show you how easy it is to add authentication and authorization to a web app using the Microsoft Identity platform\n \nContact\nChristos Matskas | @christosmatskas\nJohn Patrick Dandison | @azureAndChill\n \nResources\nCheck out the Microsoft.Identity.Web repo on Github (https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-identity-web)\n-------------------------------------\n\nAPI Security with .NET 6 and the Microsoft Identity Platform\n\n.NET 6 is just around the corner and in this demo we'll show you how to use the new minimal API template with the Microsoft Identity platform to secure access to sensitive data\n\nContact\nChristos Matskas | @christosmatskas\nJohn Patrick Dandison | @azureAndChill\n\nResources\nExplore the Minimal API Documentation on Github Minimal APIs at a glance (github.com)\n(https://gist.github.com/davidfowl/ff1addd02d239d2d26f4648a06158727)\n-------------------------------------\n\nA new tool to help you configure Azure AD for your apps\n\nThe`dotnet new â€“auth` command is great for setting up authentication in your code but this only takes you half way through the process. What if there was a tool to help you configure the Azure AD Side of things as well so all you have to do is run it and then press F5? Jean Marc Prieur will show us how to install and use a new tool to configure Azure AD for your .NET apps\n\nContact\nchristos matskas, Jean Marc Prieur, @christosmatskas, @jm_prieur\n \nResources\nRead about the new tooling here (https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-identity-web/blob/master/tools/app-provisioning-tool/README.md#msidentity-app-sync)\n-------------------------------------\n\nAutomate Azure AD App Registrations with Python Jupyter Notebooks\n\nOne of the challenges that developers face is provisioning and configuring Azure AD App Registrations. Using Microsoft Graph and Python or .NET Notebooks we can automate complex scenarios and set up Azure AD to work with our solutions. The benefit of using this approach is that it can also help with DevOps since we can run Notebooks as part of our release pipeline and hence make the transition from Dev to Production more robust and consistent.\n \nContact\nchristos matskas, @christosmatskas\n \nResources\nWorking with Jupyter Notebooks in Visual Studio Code\n(https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks)\n \nChapters\n--------\n00:00:00 Intro\n00:00:21 Quick Overview\n00:06:38 Secure .NET Web Apps using the Microsoft Identity Platform\n00:16:56 A new tool to help you configure Azure AD for your apps \n00:30:57 API Security with .NET 6 and the Microsoft Identity Platform\n00:42:13 Humans of Microsoft\n00:49:06 Automate Azure AD App Registrations with Python Jupyter Notebooks\n\nUseful links\n-------------------\nJoin us Backstage: https://aka.ms/HelloWorld/BackStage   \niCal URL: https://aka.ms/helloworld/reminder"
