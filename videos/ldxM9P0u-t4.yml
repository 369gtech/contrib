description: "DevDay,\n5th October 2012, Krak√≥w\n\n\"In this talk, Mark will introduce some of the internal code that drives the Simple.Data library and the Simple.Web framework. There will be coding tricks and techniques learned while building the packages, including runtime dynamics and code generation (not as scary as it sounds); a look at some of the architectural and design decisions; and tips on how to build add-ons and plug-ins to extend them for your specific requirements.\""
