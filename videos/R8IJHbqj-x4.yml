title: 'Message Driven Architecture (Part 3)'
recordingDate: 1299526902
description: "By Mark Fisher\r\nThis seminar will provide an overview of Spring's support for scheduling, messaging, and enterprise integration. You will learn how these features provide a platform for message-driven architecture. You will also learn about Spring's support for Hohpe and Woolf's Enterprise Integration Patterns. This will include demos of several basic patterns such as Message Channel, Message Transformer, and Message Router, as well as composite patterns such as Scatter/Gather using a Splitter and Aggregator. The examples will also cover different options for adding custom integration logic within the configuration-driven context. Those options include not only POJOs, but also Spring 3.0's Expression Language and Groovy scripts. Finally, you will see Channel Adapters and Messaging Gateways that support JMS, Web Services, Email, and more."
