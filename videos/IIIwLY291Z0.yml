description: "Talk \nCOVID-19, the pandemic that kills 30K+ globally by May 18th, is also the hot topic in data analytics/science. Media, research institutes and data scientists created many visualization projects. Some projects are informative and creative, some are flawed. Quite a few are designed to mislead people without analytical skills. This talk serves as a critical review of such projects.\n\nSpeaker \nData science instructor, senior data scientist at Galvanize.\n\nM.S. in Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California\n\nM.A. in Physics, University of Southern California\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.
