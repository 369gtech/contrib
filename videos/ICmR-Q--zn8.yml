title: 'Reactive UIs with the Model-View-View-Model (MVVM) Pattern: Simple with Ankor.io'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433245571
description: "In this session, you will learn about the benefits of using the MVVM design pattern for a state-of-the-art UI. You know MVC and why it is good to distinguish between the model and the view? You will learn why it is also a good idea to introduce a specialized  view model  and deliberately separate it from your  domain model.  This pattern is perfect for modern rich clients (JavaFX) and also for server-side UI facades. A rich server-side presentation model with all the UI logic and simple-to-write clients in various client technologies (HTML5, JavaFX, iOS, Android, ...)? Event-driven nonblocking technologies to boost your multicore server machine to full capacity? Yes, all this is possible and easy with the new Ankor open source framework.\n\n\nAuthors:\nManfred Geiler\nManfred lives in Vienna, Austria and is Senior Software Developer at IRIAN Solutions.\nHe is co-founder of Apache MyFaces and Apache member.\nView more trainings by Manfred Geiler at https://www.parleys.com/author/manfred-geiler\n\n Thomas Spiegl\nThomas is CEO and Senior Software Developer at IRIAN Solutions.\nHe is co-founder of Apache MyFaces and Apache member.\nView more trainings by  Thomas Spiegl at https://www.parleys.com/author/thomas-spiegl\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
