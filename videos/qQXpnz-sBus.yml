description: "Have you always been curious about what machine learning can do for your business problem, but could never find the time to learn the practical necessary skills? Do you wish to learn what Classification, Regression, Clustering and Feature Extraction techniques do, and how to apply them using the Oracle Machine Learning family of products?\n\nJoin us for this special series “Oracle Machine Learning Office Hours – Machine Learning 101”, where we will go through the main steps of solving a Business Problem from beginning to end, using the different components available in Oracle Machine Learning: programming languages and interfaces, including Notebooks with SQL, UI, and languages like R and Python.\n\nThis first session in the series will cover Classification, where we will learn how to set up a data set for classification modeling, build machine learning models that can, e.g., discern between good or bad customers for a marketing offer, and evaluate the quality of that model."
