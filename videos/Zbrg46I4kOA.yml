title: 'Stepping up the game against Web trackers'
recordingDate: 1548300293
description: "Martin Krafft\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/248/\n\nThe attempt to standardize the Do-Not-Track HTTP request header is going nowhere, and it's cute anyway, in that it expects the other\r\nside to honour the request, and how would we know if they did? After all, tracking is serious business, and it's hard to imagine a company in this field walking past money lying on the street without picking it up.\r\n\r\nMartin is at war with what the Web has become, and he's here to talk to you about techniques he's using to minimise his browsing\r\nfootprint on a day to day basis. Do not attend if you'd prefer to think of the Web as the decentralized knowledge-sharing network it was originally conceived as.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
