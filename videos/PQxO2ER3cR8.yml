description: "In conjunction with Project Lambda (JSR 335), Java SE 8 will enhance type inference for method and constructor invocations. This session explains everything you need to know about inference in Java 8. It discusses (1) the algorithm’s much broader use of context, which eliminates the majority of common failures; (2) how dependencies between type variables are more intelligently resolved; (3) the special treatment given to lambda expressions and method references that appear as invocation arguments; and (4) how these changes affect migration of legacy code and the error messages generated by javac. You’ll leave empowered to understand and make the best use of type inference in your Java code.\n\n\nAuthor:\nDaniel Smith\nundefined\nView more trainings by Daniel Smith at https://www.parleys.com/author/daniel-smith\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
