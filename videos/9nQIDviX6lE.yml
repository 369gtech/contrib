recordingDate: 1547645939
description: "\"Magical caches are terrorizing engineers. When engineers are afraid, they debug. Contain this, or itâ€™ll mean refactoring.\" (c)\nThe story of how an internal Hibernate cache can consume 99% of 30GiB of your application memory with just the addition of a single line of code. The way it was discovered and root cause analysis to prevent it in the future will be the topic of the talk."
