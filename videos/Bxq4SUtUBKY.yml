description: "I was messing around with the Fibonacci function with non-integer inputs and I had to figure out how to find nth roots of negative numbers. While I was figuring that out I discovered how roots work on the complex number plane and I was so amazed (astounded?) that I had to make a Sal Khan style video to demonstrate what I learned.\n\nNOTE: I know I sound kinda like Sal Khan but I'm not him. I have no association with him other than that I admire his teaching style and so I emulated it.\n\nIf you have any questions or corrections you can contact me at bs.vino@gmail.com or on Twitter @VinoBS"
