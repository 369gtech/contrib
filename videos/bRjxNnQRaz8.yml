Creating a sustainable self-service funnel can be a game-changer for scalable revenue creation. At Appcues, we used product-driven semiautomation and enablement to double our conversions on this high volume segment, creating hundreds of new paying customers. In this talk, we'll walk through the steps involved, and show how what we learned can be applied to both low- and high-touch sales processes. \n\n1. Define what a person needs to do before they buy\n2. Make it easy for your product to talk to your team\n3. Give one person autonomy over the content + leads\n4. Enable the rest of the sales/marketing team\n\nThe speech took place on 8th May 2019 on Marketing Stage during Infoshare 2019."
