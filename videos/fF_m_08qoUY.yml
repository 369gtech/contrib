description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nMicroservices Made Easy! - Donovan Brown & Jessica Deen, Microsoft\n\nHave you made the jump to microservices only to discover the development experience is less than ideal? We get it, microservices can be HARD, but they don’t have to be. In this session we will help you simplify your developer interloop and boost your productivity. We will focus on Dapr and Bridge to Kubernetes, both open source, and geared towards simplifying your life as a developer. Dapr is a portable, event-driven runtime that makes it easy for any developer to build resilient, stateless, and stateful applications using any language, targeting any cloud or the edge. Bridge to Kubernetes uses Envoy to extend the Kubernetes perimeter to your development computer allowing you to write, test, and debug microservice code while connected to any Kubernetes cluster with the rest of your application or services. The bridge to microservices harmony can be messy, but a technical deep dive powered by the open-source tooling will have you looking Dapr in no time."
