description: "Speaker: Leon Lim and Lynus Hee\r\n\r\nA projector is a useful tool in creating a visually captivating display. Projection mapping takes that one step further by mapping the projected image onto a given surface. Combine that with electronics and you are able to create an immersive and interactive experience for the viewer.\r\n\r\nLast year, Leon Lim and Lynus Hee made a interactive table top using projection mapping software, custom motion graphics and electronics. In this talk, they will share how it was made and put together.\r\n\r\nYou can view a video of the project here\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NHYFKV5uQ4\r\n\r\nLeon Lim will also talk about his latest project which is an interactive wall that is on display at the science center from 5th August to 25th of August.\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.facebook.com/events/1176717582474588\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/9MCb/"
