language: English
recordingDate: 1594847107
description: "Build tools are an integral part of modern web development, making it possible to build great apps that are bandwidth-friendly and delivered as-needed. However, it's surprisingly difficult to choose and configure build tools in a way that produces consistent and good results. We're often forced to make tradeoff decisions in our tooling, which can stand in the way of delivering the best possible applications on the web.\n\nWe developed a guide to help you choose tools which are best suited for your next project with example of how to set one up. Come find out how we defined what's the best tool for a job and how we investigated and tested each one.\n\nResources:\nwebpack → https://goo.gle/3eFLmsT \nrollup → https://goo.gle/2ZfQJse \nParcel → https://goo.gle/3i3Z1fr \nEleventy → https://goo.gle/2BdWUFh \nGatsby → https://goo.gle/2Zd1USr \n\nCheckout the website → https://goo.gle/3eDuvad \n\nThank you to tooling authors and reviewers for their support in the development of tooling.report!\n\nRelated Playlist:\nDay 3 → https://goo.gle/WDL20Day3\n\nSubscribe to the Chrome Developers → https://goo.gle/ChromeDevs\n\nSpeaker:\nMariko Kosaka\n\n#webdevLIVE #webpack"
