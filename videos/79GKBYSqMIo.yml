language: English
recordingDate: 1520754653
description: "It’s 2017 and we’re all doing microservices and continuous delivery now (yay!). Except, somehow with all of this betterness we’re not able to create more value to our customers as fast as we should.\n\nIn this talk, we’ll discuss the fallout from the post-Monolithic era, a key to understanding why we are where we are. We’ll discuss why integration testing is bad for your health, how to deal with legacy architectures and how to truly optimise delivery for the entire value chain.\n\nBeth became a developer not because she particularly likes computers, but because she loves to solve problems and make things that are useful. Her involvement with the open source project, Pact, has led to speaking opportunities at conferences around Australia. Beth’s favourite things to do at work are talking about Pacts and deleting code.\n\n\nFor more on YOW! conferences, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
