description: "Presented at droidcon Italy 2020\n\nMOTIONLAYOUT & RECYCLERVIEW\nJason Pearson, Principal Android Engineer, Hinge\n\nOne of the first and easiest things we do as Android Developers is rendering a list of items. Commonly, one of the hardest things we do next is trying to animate items in that list in a variety of ways.\n\nEver since Hoford & Roard showcased the possibility of animating a RecyclerView with MotionLayout a lot of people have wondered how to actually implement it. I'll be showcasing how my work has evolved in the past year in this specific vein, the issues I encountered, and new routes forward.\n\nhttps://it.droidcon.com/2020/​​​​​\nhttps://twitter.com/Droidconit​​​​​\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/showcase/droidcon-italy\nhttps://www.facebook.com/droidconIt"
