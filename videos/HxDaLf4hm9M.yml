title: 'Lo√Øc Hoguin - The Last REST Client You Will Ever Need'
recordingDate: 1406106816
description: "People never seem to realize that writing a RESTful service -as opposed to a REST-like service like you see everywhere- pretty much lets them avoid writing a client and updating said client when the API changes.\n\nThis is what this talk is about.\n\nWe will start by discussing REST a little, summarize what really matters at the API level, and discuss how we can end up writing a single generic client that will work across all versions of all our REST services.\n\nAt the end of the talk I will present a series of tools and guidelines that make all this not only possible but also very easy, including the last REST client that you will ever need."
