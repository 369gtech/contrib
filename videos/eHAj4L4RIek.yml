description: "Ports & Adapters is an important part of any architecture in software engineering, no matter which coding language you are using. Those help you create boundaries between the business logic and implementation details, resulting in a scalable project that has the ability to replace any mechanism you want in a very short time, such as changing the DB, the UI or any third-party app your code uses.\n\nIn the forth episode of our new Wix Engineering - Tech Talks Show, Ofir Attal simplifies the why, and how we use ports & adapters in a short code example. Ofir also shows a code that violates the architecture and how we can fix that code to align with the ports & adapters architecture.\n\nStay tuned for episode 5..."
