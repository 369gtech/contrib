description: "On a mission to take that seriousness away from the world of web development Timâ€™s talk, Fun.css, delves into some of the strangest areas of the internet. Tim introduces us to unusual and bizarre techniques and ways of thinking that we can use to create friendlier and, at the very least, more interesting experiences.\n\nTim is an Australian developer who has both a love and a flair for all things quirky and strange online. When he's not working on Tumblr, you'll find him building something bizarre which, in his own words, the world definitely does not need.\n\nhttp://2015.cssconf.eu/"
