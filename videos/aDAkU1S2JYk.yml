title: 'Hit the Ground Running with WebAssembly (How To Start Using WebAssembly In Your Apps)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1631199600
description: "For over 20 years, JavaScript was the only scripting language you could use reliably in a browser. That all changed a few years ago, when WebAssembly became supported by all major browsers. This talk is a 29,032-foot overview of WebAssembly, why it's awesome, and how to get started using it. As concrete use cases, Robert will mention two open source tools he contributed to where WebAssembly improved performance, and enabled reusing C/C++ code on the web. The talk will also cover upcoming WebAssembly features such as threads and SIMD, and will end with a discussion of use cases where WebAssembly shines (...and when the added complexity might not be worth it!)\n\n***\n\nMost Googled Viruses: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnG4d2SaIYw\n\n***\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).
