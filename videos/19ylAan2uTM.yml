recordingDate: 1511995046
description: "Scaling DevOps Talent in a Large Enterprise\n\nPaula Thrasher, Director, Digital Services, CSRA \n\nOne of the biggest challenges to transformations in large organizations is growing competence fast enough to build on your initial successes. CSRA has implemented three programs to address talent at all levels of a DevOps transformation, including leaders and middle managers, technical resources, and our pipeline of new hires. By addressing the new skills needed to build a DevOps organization we helped drive adoption of DevOps technologies and culture across the enterprise. These programs were designed to be low cost but impactful, and drive both meaningful skill building as well as increase relationships between teams.\n\nDOES17 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
