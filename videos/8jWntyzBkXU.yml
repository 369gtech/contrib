description: "In part five of the Azure SQL Virtual Machine Reimagined series, we will a do deep dive of HA & DR technologies for Azure SQL VMs. We'll cover how to simplify HA & DR configuration by adopting multi subnet approach and thus eliminating the need for an Azure Load Balancer. Multi subnet congratulation is natively supported by SQL Server and Windows Server Failover Cluster and simplifies deployment, maintenance and improves failover time.\n\n0:00 Stream begins\n1:16 Introductions\n3:08 SQL VM HA & DR Overview\n26:30 Simplify HR & DR configuration\n32:20 Demo: Secondary IP, Add Secondary IP\n34:10 Multi subnet configuration - steps involved\n36:48 Demo: Windows cluster, AG resources in cluster, AG & AG Listener in SSMS, Test connectivity from client, Test failover, Test connectivity from client\n48:50 Demo: Zone Redundant Shared disk​, Windows cluster​, SQL FCI resources in cluster​, Test connectivity from client​, Failover in cluster​, Test connectivity from client​\n56:00 Comparing available HA DR configurations\n\n✔️Resources:\nSQL Server on Azure VM documentation: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/virtual-machines/\n\n📝 Azure SQL Virtual Machine Reimagined Series playlist: https://aka.ms/azuresqlvmyt\n\n📌 Let's connect:\nTwitter: Pam Lahoud, https://twitter.com/SQLGoddess\nTwitter: Rajesh Setlem, https://twitter.com/RajeshSetlem\nTwitter: Anna Hoffman, https://twitter.com/AnalyticAnna\nTwitter: AzureSQL, https://aka.ms/azuresqltw\n\n🔴 To check out even more Data Exposed Live episodes, see our playlist: https://aka.ms/dataexposedlive\n\n🔔 Subscribe to our channels for even more SQL tips: https://aka.ms/msazuresqlyt\n\n✏️ If you are interested in finding out about Reactor sessions please check out our Reactor meetup page or sign up for our monthly newsletter:\nhttps://aka.ms/MicrosoftReactorMeetup \nhttps://aka.ms/ReactorEmailSignUp\n\n#AzureSQL​​ #AzureSQLVM #AzureSQLVirtualMachine"
