description: "Data Scientists strive to experiment as quickly, easily, and effectively as possible. The difference between a 30 second local code change and a 10 minute CI/CD pipeline can cost days of productivity through iterations. In this talk, Rappi Data Engineer Gonzalo Diaz and Apache Airflow Committer Daniel Imberman describe a process for building a simple yet scalable data pipeline and massive scalable.\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
