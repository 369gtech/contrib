recordingDate: 1554770431
description: 'As an independent developer you probably don’t have the luxury of a dedicated product manager, but that doesn’t mean you can’t benefit from product management techniques. Learn about market research and finding the “jobs to be done”, getting useful user feedback, picking the right features to build and how to keep yourself on the right track to ship successful products and updates.'
