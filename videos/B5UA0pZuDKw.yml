description: "SQL Server object disks on Windows Server can be expanded at any time with no issues, but Linux doesn‚Äôt quite work like that by default. In a situation where you run out of space, you‚Äôre out of luck, unless you know some secrets about Linux. The mysterious Linux Logical Volume Manager must be used before you put anything on the disks to properly set up the disks so you can expand them in a pinch in the future. In this episode with David Klee, we‚Äôre going to walk through how to use this service to set up your object volumes the right way from the beginning and show you how to expand the disks with no outage.
