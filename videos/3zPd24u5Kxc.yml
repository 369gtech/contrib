title: 'Scala js: getting the best of JavaScript and Scala by Sébastien Doeraene'

description: "Scala.js is one of those languages that compile to JavaScript. Its distinctive feature is that it strives to a) be as close as possible to its big brother Scala/JVM and b) let you directly talk to JavaScript libraries. On the one hand, existing Scala libraries can be cross-compiled and have their tests pass with only a few changes in the build definition. And on the other hand, Scala.js developers can use JavaScript libraries, often without feeling that they cross a language boundary.\n\nIn this talk, we will present Scala.js through a running example of developing a small game based on the JavaScript library Phaser. In the process, the attendee will get a feel of the language, one possible development workflow, and what it's like to use a JS library right from Scala.js\n\nSébastien Doeraene is a compiler/runtime systems hacker and a Scala enthusiast. He is a Ph.D. student at EPFL in the programming methods laboratory (LAMP, aka the Scala team) led by Martin Odersky, where he designs and develops Scala.js. He holds bachelor and master degrees in computer science engineering from Université Catholique de Louvain in Belgium. When he is not busy coding, he sings in choirs and a cappella groups."
