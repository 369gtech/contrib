These are the voyagers of the average developer, to create stable features, to join in the CI/CD world, to boldly develop minimum amount of code!\n\nMany people say it is impossible to develop a front end application without opening the browser. I’m here to put these claims to the (unit) test!\n\nIn this talk we will build a working app - without opening the browser during the development process.\n\nBy the end of this talk, you will see the true meaning of TDD and how you can work with it to become a better developer.\n\nReady to become a TDD master? This talk is for you!\n\n---\n\nConFrontJS 2018 - #Frontend #Conference in #Warsaw, Poland\nDate: 29 October 2018\nVenue: Campus Warsaw, Poland\n\n??
