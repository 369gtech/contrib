description: "Zev Youra at JS.LA, the best JavaScript event in Los Angeles. Filmed at PatientPop in Los Angeles.\n\n\"I recently left Google after ~4.5 years to work on some new projects. Since then, I've been spending most of my time working on multi-layered data visualizations, and will talk through the creation of a few examples. I'll also discuss the workflow I've developed to present them both as interactive visualizations on the web and as pre-rendered videos for consumption on twitter, facebook, etc.\"\n\nhttps://www.github.com/zzzev\nhttps://www.twitter.com/zzzev"
