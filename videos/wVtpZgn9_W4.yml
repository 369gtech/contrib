recordingDate: 1410972975
description: "From the 2014 Velocity Conference in New York City.\n\nThe last decade has seen an investment by all market participants in technology at an unprecedented pace as evidenced by the ability to interact with thousands of order type combinations at speeds and capacity volumes enabled by the latest technology innovations. This is a testament to our ability to be able to adapt to change and implement solutions that amplify intentions of market participants. The increase in change to the “systems-of-systems” that are the technical foundations of our markets has markedly simplified our ability to automate and interact to any market center where instruments are traded. The complexity of our markets have increased. Failure and resiliency are just around the corner. This talk will cover some of the the pros and cons of complexity in the stock market.\n\nAbout Zoran Perkov (IEX Group):\nZoran is currently the Head of Technology Operations at IEX Group where he helps in ensuring that the trading system does not blow up in the middle of the day.
