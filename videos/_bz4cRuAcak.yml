title: 'LISP Part 2 - Mapping Database Infrastructure and Interworking'
language: English
recordingDate: 1269610867
description: "Google Tech Talk\r\nFebruary 17, 2010\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nPresented by Dino Farinacci.\r\n\r\nIn Part 1, we discussed how endpoint IDs and routing Locators are used to provide a level of indirection for routing and addressing. This session will describe all the database mapping algorithms we have considered for mapping an EID to a set of Locators. We will take about the technical challenges of each and brainstorm about the business models that develop as a result of each mapping database algorithm. We will then show how LISP can be deployed to interoperate non-LISP site that run IPv4 and/or IPv6 for a seamless integration.\r\n\r\nDino Farinacci:\r\nDino originally joined Cisco in spring of 1991 and was one of the first two Cisco Fellows. He has built routers for 27 years. Dino currently works in the Data Center Business Unit at cisco where his focus is on building a next-generation platform and operating system for Enterprise and Data Center environments. This platform is the Nexus 7000 running NX-OS which shipped in April of 2008. \r\nHis expertise specializes in routing protocols where he has intimate knowledge and implementation experience with IS-IS, EIGRP, OSPF, BGP, IGMP, PIM, and MSDP, as well as IPv6 and MPLS protocols.\r\n\r\nHe is an advocate for modular operating systems. Dino also has been a member of the IETF for 19 years making many contributions over this period of time. Dino has worked for Cisco since early 1991 but was away for 5 years at Procket Networks where he help build the highest speed and most dense router (still to date) in a half rack chassis which ran a fully modular operating system. He has been back at cisco for 5 years where he is currently working on new multicast routing technology such as Multicast Fast-Reroute, AMT, Multicast Virtualization, and layer-2 multicast for Data-Center Ethernet. Dino invented OTV with his routing colleagues in DCBU and wrote the initial implementation on NX-OS.\r\n\r\nDino is not just a multicast bigot but works on many other protocol and OS initiatives. For example, recently he is prototyping an idea called LISP to separate an IP address into an ID and Locator to allow the Internet to scale better. LISP has been accepted as a working group of the IETF where Dino participates intimately authoring 7 Internet Drafts."
