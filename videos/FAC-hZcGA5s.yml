description: "Qasim K \n\n\n\nWhile the best code is no code at all, we do need to deal with the rest of it\n\nCode review is essential for security, sharing knowledge, and preventing bugs. It can also take up a lot of time, especially if you want to be thorough - at one point I was spending more time reviewing than actually coding.\n\nFortunately, there is a wide range of tools that are very good at taking much of the common and tedious checking off your hands. Using these can leave us free to focus on the big picture, whether reviewing someone else's code or checking over your own.\n\nNaturally, I ended up spending more time wrangling with these tools than actually coding, but I did learn which ones were worthwhile for which situation.\n\nIn this talk we'll look at the tools available to check the code style, find bugs, or detect security issues, and find out how to best use (or avoid) them to speed up development both now and in the long-run."
