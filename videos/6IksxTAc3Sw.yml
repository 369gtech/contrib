title: 'Centralized Logging Patterns by Philipp Krenn'

description: "Most organizations feel the need to centralize their logs ? once you have more than a couple of systems, SSH and tail will not serve you well any more. This talk presents multiple approaches and patterns with their advantages and disadvantages:\n\nParse: Take the log files of your applications and extract the relevant pieces of information.\nSend: Add a log appender to send out your events directly without persisting them to a log file.\nStructure: Write your events in a structured file, which you can then centralize.\nContainerize: Keep track of short lived containers and configure their logging correctly. Orchestrate: Stay on top of your logs even when services are short lived and dynamically allocated on Kubernetes."
