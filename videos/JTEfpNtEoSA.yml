description: "JavaScript is often derided for callback hell and for quirks around equality, number handling, type coercions and the \"this\" keyword. This is largely a straw man argument. Developers work around these shortcomings through conventions, tools, and libraries and problems caused by these kinds of quirks come up infrequently. This talk instead aims to explore the best ways that I know how to write JavaScript- using good conventions, using functional libraries, using types, using promises and immutable data- and motivate PureScript as a way of pushing the limits and bringing development in the JavaScript ecosystem to the next level.\n\nEVENT:\n\nReaktor Breakpoint 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nNicholas Kariniemi\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nReaktor provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvPBMEYxP-Y"
