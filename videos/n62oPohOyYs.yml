description: "Lightning Talk: Behind The Scenes: Kubernetes Release Notes Tips & Tricks - Mike Arpaia, Kolide \n\nThis session aims to shed more light on the release note process from the Kubernetes contributor's point of view. We will briefly discuss the entire release note process from PR to release day. We will pay special attention to the labels and prow commands that contributors can (and should!) use to add context to PRs so that the release note automation can most effectively sort and prepare the document. Finally, we will discuss some common copy-editing tips and tricks that you can use to make sure the final document is consistent and helpful for end-users (spoiler: write your note in the past tense!). \n\nTo learn more: https://sched.co/GrV1"
