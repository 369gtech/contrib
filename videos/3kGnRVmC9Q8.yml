title: 'The Power of Open Source, Open Containers, and an Open Cloud by Philip Estes/Ralph Bateman'
language: English
recordingDate: 1447308044
description: "IBM has been fully committed to open source software for over a decade. Starting with an initial commitment to Linux, IBM's open source involvement has grown from an initial focus on the Linux kernel, to creating and open sourcing Eclipse, to present day involvement in the OpenStack, Cloud Foundry, and Docker communities.\n\nSo why do large enterprises like IBM value Open Source? This talk will reveal the power of open source communities, specifically looking at the arena of cloud computing. We'll look at how IBM is involved in improving hot technologies like Docker, enabling the \"build, ship, and run\" metaphor from a developer's laptop all the way up to a production-ready and secure public cloud.\n\nMore than just talk, we want to demonstrate these capabilities live in a fun and engaging way. We'll use a gaming application containerized and deployed in a public Docker cloud with audience participation to show how these technologies work in a real-world scenario that will hopefully offer a fun way to experience the power of an open cloud architecture!"
