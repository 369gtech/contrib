title: 'Oracle Java ME Embedded: Making Small Devices Smarter'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433784724
description: "Oracle Java Embedded enables devices to become more intelligent, remotely updatable, and able to make better  local  decisions. Oracle Java ME Embedded in particular is optimized for small devices, providing important support for on-the-fly application downloads and updates, remote operations without compromising the integrity of the underlying system, and addition of new capabilities without an impact on existing functions. This is exactly what small devices need if they have to be smart. One of the novel examples is Livescribeâ€™s Sky wifi smartpen. This session is a case study illustrating how a small embedded device can be so much more useful with extra intelligence made possible when the platform is opened up for additional value-added apps.\n\n\nAuthors:\nRenu Motwani\nRenu is a member of Oracle's Java Product Management Team.\nView more trainings by Renu Motwani at https://www.parleys.com/author/renu-motwani\n\nSekar Srinivasan\nTBD\nView more trainings by Sekar Srinivasan at https://www.parleys.com/author/sekar-srinivasan\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
