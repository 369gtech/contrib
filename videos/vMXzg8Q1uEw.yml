description: "When and Why Does Portability Matter? Exploring Multi-cloud, Open Source and Cloud Switching Costs - Dan Young, EngineerBetter\n\nIn a world without viable AWS alternatives and nascent levels of adoption, high cloud switching costs have been of secondary concern; productivity has always trumped portability. However as AWS usage and skills become more evenly distributed, the competitive advantage of early adopters begins to evaporate. \n\nBarbara Liskov said ‘Modularity through abstraction is the way things get done’. With Cloud Foundry and BOSH we now have an abstraction layer that allows us to imagine IaaS providers as modular building blocks, or a competitive utility market. \n\nIn this talk Dan will examine the evidence that points to multi-cloud defining the next phase of competitive advantage and also explain how business leaders in 2016 can use this to make better economic choices regarding their investment in cloud platform skills and technology.\n\nAbout Dan Young\nDan Young is CEO of the UK Cloud Foundry consultancy EngineerBetter, having worn a variety of hats over the last 15 years, spanning engineering, presales and product management. He’s been a Cloud Foundry enthusiast since 2012, long-term member of the London PaaS User Group meetup community and is also a Cloud Foundry Ambassador. His ongoing quest to understand and resolve organisational friction has led Dan to recognise PaaS as a helpful vehicle for changing things for the better. He has spoken at numerous industry events during his career, as well as LOPUG and CF Summit BOSH Day"
