description: "How do you make CSS easier to work with? Write less of it.\n\nThe more CSS we write, the more difficult our stylesheets are to work with. When stylesheets are difficult to work with, we're likely to write more CSS. This leads to more bugs, less consistency, and more frustration for both developers and designers.\n\nAdam focuses on both technical and human problems related to maintaining CSS and a few solutions that have worked best at Meetup in our pursuit to write less CSS.\n\nWhether you're working with a legacy website or building a new React application with component-specific styles, he shows you how the most powerful CSS is the CSS you don't have to write.\n\nEVENT:\n\ndotCSS 2017\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nAdam Detrick\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nThe original video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tvHSwFR4-Y"
