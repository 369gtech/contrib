title: 'Real-time Analytics with Azure Cosmos DB and Apache Spark - BRK4004'
recordingDate: 1557365371
description: "Spark is the world’s foremost distributed analytics platform, delivering in-memory analytics with a speed and ease of use unheard of in Hadoop. Azure Cosmos DB is the lighting fast distributed database powering Fortune 500 companies like Walmart, Exxon Mobile, Toyota and many others. Did you know you can combine them easily using our natively built azure-cosmosdb-spark connector or now you can use the new Spark API feature integration that allows Spark to fully take advantage of Cosmos DB to run real-time analytics directly on petabytes of operational data! \r\nIn this session we’ll go over some of the most common use cases of the azure-cosmosdb-spark connector and highlight how to avoid the most common pitfalls. We will talk about the new Azure Cosmos DB Spark API and the native support it brings for Apache Spark engines executing directly on petabytes of operational data stored in your globally distributed Cosmos databases. We will walk through the capabilities Spark API brings to developers, data engineers and data scientists such that they can use Cosmos DB as a flexible, scalable, and performant planet-scale data platform for running both OLTP and HTAP workloads alike."
