description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Chicago 2019. #GOTOcon #GOTOchgo\nhttp://gotochgo.com\n\nChris Richardson - Creator of the original CloudFoundry.com and author of 'POJOs in Action' and 'Microservices Patterns'\n\nABSTRACT\nThe microservice architecture functionally decomposes an application into a set of services. Each service has its own private database that’s only accessible indirectly through the services API. Consequently, implementing queries and transactions that span multiple services is challenging.\nIn this presentation, you will learn how to solve these distributed data management challenges using asynchronous messaging. Chris will share with you how to implement transactions using sagas, which are sequences of local transactions. You will learn how to coordinate sagas using either events or command messages. Chris will also explore how to implement queries using Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS), which [...]\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotochgo.com/2019/sessions/717\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOchgo\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\n#Microservices #CQRS #Events #APIs #AsynchronousMicroservices\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO Conference near you!
