recordingDate: 1530789714
description: "In this talk, Joe Sepi goes over the many ways in which you---YES YOU!---can get involved with open source. Whether you are highly technical or not technical at all, there are many ways to contribute to the open source community through: code contributions, issue triage, project management, communications, community relations, design, writing, testing, documentation, integrations, and more!. The more people involved the better, so let's destroy all barriers to entry, establish some on-ramps and hit the road! \n\nThe global dev community meets at WeAreDevelopers, an event dubbed by many as the “Woodstock of Developers”. The WeAreDevelopers World Congress 2018 brought together 8,000 techies from 70 countries for 72-hours of pure dev-fun.\n\nVisit the largest developer playground in Europe!\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/wearedevelopers\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/WeAreDevs\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/_wearedevelopers/\n\n#WeAreDevs\n\n©2018, WeAreDevelopers"
