Every design decision, from the circuit board to the plastic can effect the results. We'll talk about product design, manufacturing, firmware, software, and the Arduino API as we cover the Jewelbots timeline from Kickstarter to shipping to distribution. Additionally, hear from the two girls who are the top Jewelbots from the Bellevue area! You'll learn what they have built and how they view the future of C++.\n—\nSara Chipps: Jewelbots, CEO\n\nSara Chipps is a JavaScript developer based in NYC.
