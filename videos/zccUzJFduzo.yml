description: "TestCon Moscow 2017 Conference, April 27. www.testconf.ru\n\nPage Objects is probably the best-known pattern for UI Automation in Testing. Still implementing the Page Objects can be tricky in many ways even for the most typical web application. Alexei will introduce 3 types of PageObjects implementation (“Static”, “Void” and “Fluent”), which he has successfully used in his projects and explain their advantages and drawback. He will also explain why some other/additional patterns you can find in blogs/books or even get recommended in conference talks are actually no good. Warning: some pieces of advice may look provocative or even change the way you look at designing UI tests completely! The session will show Java Code examples (Selenium/Selenide) highlighting the implementation details."
