description: "During this presentation, you will see a demonstration, including live manufacturing equipment, for an end to end feedback workflow of Industrial Spring IOT:\n\nHow Spring driven IoT can be utilized to manufacture complimentary parts from multiple industrial processes, such as CNC boring and CNC turning manufacturing operations; (matching Pistons and Cylinders in a Turbine engine as an example)\nEdge based real-time analytics and control will be demonstrated in a multi-tasking industrial Programmable Logic Controller (PLC);\nData exchange between PLC and IoT Bridge utilizing Spring Integration TCP/UDP communications;\nFog based analytics in the IoT Bridge utilizing GemFire Multi-Site data exchange and Spring Websocket based HMI;\nFinal parts matching and Quality Assurance will occur in a PCF instance utilizing cloud caching and Spring micro-services where parts sequencing data will be returned to the IoT Bridge HMI for proper sequencing of the parts in container cells.\n\nMark Weislow, Engagement Director, Pivotal\nBarry Wood, CTO - IoT Practice, RPY Motion\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2017"
