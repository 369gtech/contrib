description: "If you're interested in concurrency, actor-oriented programming, and emerging technologies, then this talk is for you. We'll be discussing safe patterns for lockless concurrency and how Pony, an emerging actor language built on LLVM, provides a platform for describing these patterns in our code explicitly, verifying our code's safety, and compiling high-performance concurrent applications.\n\nKey takeaways\nYou'll learn about common patterns for safe lockless concurrency\nYou'll learn about how Pony enforces those patterns via reference capabilities in the type system\nYou'll learn about other key concepts in Pony\nYou'll get a brief look at where Pony is going\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
