description: "Google Tech Talks\r\nJuly 24, 2008\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nFaculty Summit 2008 - Day 1\r\nGeo API - Keith Golden\r\nOne of the keys to the success of Google Maps is a rich API that can be used by outside developers and researchers to create interactive applications and mashups. There are over 150,000 active Maps API websites representing a broad range of applications from Earth science to social networking. The Maps API continues to grow as new features are added to Maps; recent additions to the API include support for Street View panoramas, rendering 3D models through the Earth plugin, My Maps editing, geocoding, local search, driving directions and traffic. This interactive session will discuss Google Maps as a development platform and show how powerful web applications or research prototypes can easily be built on top of Maps. Audience participation is highly encouraged.\r\n\r\nSpeaker: Keith Golden"
