description: "Learning to code is full of AHA moments, failing forward, clarity, confusion, and everything in between. Sarah (Dr. G) has dedicated her professional career to not only learning new things, but also learning how people learn new things. \n\nWhile earning her PhD in computer science, she focused on building curriculum and tools to help novices of all ages take their first steps on their personal coding journey. Along the way, she's taught thousands of children, career changers, teachers, and university professors how to code, and more importantly, about the two most important pieces to success: perseverance and community.\n\nJoin Dr. G on an exploration of some of Microsoft's student programs and resources for novices interested in starting their tech journey.\n\nInterview with Pablo Veramendi\nhttps://aka.ms/LearnWithDrG/Hackathons\n\nStudent Programs\nhttps://imaginecup.microsoft.com/\nhttps://studentambassadors.microsoft.com/\n\nPrograms for Developers\nhttps://mvp.microsoft.com/\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learncloudchallenge/\n\nLearning Resources\nhttps://aka.ms/LearnWithDrG/Students\n\nPast Conferences with Novice Content\nhttps://aka.ms/LearnWithDrG/BuildWithStudents\nhttps://myignite.microsoft.com/learning-zone\nhttps://startdevchange.com"
