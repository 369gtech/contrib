description: "Welcome back! It's time to write our first classifier. This is a milestone if youâ€™re new to machine learning. We'll start with our code from episode #4 and comment out the classifier we imported. Then, we'll code up a simple replacement - using a scrappy version of k-Nearest Neighbors. \n\nYou can follow https://twitter.com/random_forests for updates on new episodes, and have fun!\n\nSubscribe to the Google Developers: http://goo.gl/mQyv5L - \nSubscribe to the brand new Firebase Channel: https://goo.gl/9giPHG\nAnd here's our playlist: https://goo.gl/KewA03"
