recordingDate: 1531123730
description: "The DevTools in all current modern browsers provide a valuable set of instruments for web developers to create, inspect and debug their work. But what about web designers?\n\nSophisticated tools for creating and experimenting freely with CSS have been missing from browsers. But there’s a recent uptick in specialised tools for CSS which bring the creative empowerment web designers expect from professional editors right into their browser: tools like the CSS Grid Inspector in Firefox, in-context editors for CSS Shapes, fonts, animations, transforms, gradients, backgrounds and many others.\n\nThis talk provides an overview of the specialised tools for CSS available today and ventures a look ahead at the tooling opportunities that will give web designers the creative freedom they need in order to truly design in the browser.\n\nCSSconf EU will be back on May 31st 2019: https://2019.cssconf.eu/"
