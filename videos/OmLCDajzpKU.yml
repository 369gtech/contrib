title: 'nor(DEV):live - Data Science in Practice'
recordingDate: 1590132644
description: "We'll be bringing you a selection of talks from organisations around Norfolk and exploring how they're applying data science in practical solutions within their organisations to both analyse and present trends.\n\nThey will deliver three 15min talks, and we'll then bring them together to form our Data Science panel, for an AMA and Q&A for the last 15minutes.\n\nGive us a Hola in the Live Chat! You've also got several other options to follow along, ask questions and speak with the community:\n\n- You can join our Discord server, where you'll find a new dedicated voice channel (#event-room) to hang out in\n- From 18:30 you can join the Zoom call (for attendees) where you'll find a member of the NorDev committee, who will be on-hand to field your questions. This is where the after-party will be too :+1:\n- Otherwise, as always, please connect with us on Twitter, LinkedIn, or Facebook and you can send us your questions to use there. Use the hashtag #NorDevLive."
