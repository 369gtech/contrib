title: 'nor(DEV): Flutter - An Advanced Look with Tom Alabaster'
recordingDate: 1592307012
description: "In this session we’ll build upon some of the basics we learnt in my last session (widgets, navigation and persistence) but start to look further at how we can add more functionality to our apps using states, passing data between screens and switching between different platform widgets.\n\n## Agenda\n\nThis will be a hands-on coding session which you are more than welcome to join along with! Code for the starting point can be found here: https://github.com/tomalabaster/flutter_introduction_nordev_may_2020\n\n1. Alert dialogs\n2. Switching between different platform widgets\n3. Mixins\n4. Statefulness\n5. Passing data between screens\n\n## Requirements\n\nTake a look at https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install to get Flutter installed as this isn’t something covered in this talk. You can follow along on Windows, macOS or Linux using Android or iOS (macOS only).\n\n## About Flutter\n\nFlutter is Google’s cross-platform development framework. It enables developers to make apps for both Android and iOS (and for desktop and the web) from a single codebase. It produces native apps with native performance and can allow for significantly faster development times.\n\n\"Having been making mobile apps for over 4 years, I haven’t been a lover of cross-platform frameworks until now, and while I could go back to writing purely native apps, I see very few reasons to as long as Flutter is around.\"\n\n## About Norfolk Developers\n\nComplementing the existing tech community, Norfolk Developers will be peeling back the high level and going straight to the heart of software development practices and processes. We aim to bring you local, national and international speakers and workshops.\n\nYou might want to try something new or wish to take your software development up to the next level.
