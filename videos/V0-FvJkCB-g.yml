language: English
recordingDate: 1626120353
description: "Do you contribute to open-source projects or share projects with coworkers and classmates? In this talk, you’ll learn how optimize Visual Studio Code for collaborative, cross-platform C++ development. This talk will cover recommended tools and extensions for collaborative, cross-platform development, diving deep into the C++ extension, the CMake Tools extension, the GitHub Pull Requests and Issues extension, and the Live Share extension.\n\nDuring this session, we’ll build and submit a PR to an open-source CMake project in Visual Studio Code, interacting with GitHub pull requests and issues directly in the editor. You’ll also learn how to create Live Share sessions for an nontraditional pair programming experience, where you can work together while retaining personal editor preferences as well as having your own cursor. Throughout the demo, we’ll showcase Visual Studio Code’s rich, productive editing and debugging features for C++ development.\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nCppCon Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish CppCon tech talks. \n\nCREDITS:\nCppCon YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/CppCon/videos"
