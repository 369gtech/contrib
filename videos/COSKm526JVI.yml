Norwich is one of many global cities deploying a city wide network for low cost, long life battery sensors, which will enrich the understanding of our City. Enabling new opportunities to positively improve the lives of citizens and organisation living and working in the City.\n\nSince joining Microsoft in 1994, Paul Foster (https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulfo/) has worked across a wide range of sectors and customers, providing a mix of technical and strategic guidance around the creative use of technology in relation to their business needs. Paul is currently a senior software engineer at Microsoft. As an established public speaker across Europe and having spent a considerable amount of time working on the cutting edge of technology providing leadership and inspiration on topics like Smart Devices, Cloud Computing, Education and App Development, Paul is currently focusing on the building of next generation sensor webs which automate the gathering of data from disparate sources, and how to enable the creative analysis of this data to start a new era of perception. For a short-time Paul was a member of a high-wire flying trapeze circus troupe, is a keen roboticist and an international marathon runner."
