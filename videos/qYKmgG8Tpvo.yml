description: "Jerry Talton, Director of Data & Machine Learning, Carta\nPresented at MLconf 2018\nAbstract: Carta was founded in 2012 with a mission to help private companies, public companies, investors, and employees manage their cap tables, valuations, portfolio investments, and equity plans. As a result, Carta is mapping one of the world’s most valuable propriety datasets: the ownership graph. In this talk, I’ll present recent work analyzing how startups distribute ownership across their employees, and discuss the implications for companies looking to deploy more just and equitable compensation strategies. Then, I’ll sketch some fundamental questions machine learning can answer about ownership, and outline strategies for tackling them at scale."
