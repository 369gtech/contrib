language: English
recordingDate: 1595473211
description: "C++ code is fraught with perils and pitfalls. That's why a thorough and meticulous code review is very important. The purpose of this talk is to (hopefully) improve your ability to take on such a task. We'll take a look at some error patterns easily overlooked. In all honesty, many people just don't know about them. Meet a dangerous emplace_back, an unexpected integer overflow, a skipped memset, perils of noexcept functions, and so on.\n\n--------\n\nYuri is a C++ developer at PVS-Studio. Currently working on the core features of the C++ static analyser made by the company.\n\n--------\n\nC++ on Sea is an annual c++ and coding conference, usually held in Folkestone, Kent in the UK. The 2020 conference was moved to a virtual event due to social distancing requirements.\n\nProduced and Edited by Digital Medium Ltd: https://events.digital-medium.co.uk\nEnquiries: events@digital-medium.co.uk"
