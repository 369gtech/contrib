description: "With business models and business needs changing so rapidly, an adaptable architecture is critical to enable systems to change to cope. Historically, adaptability has been sought through anticipating where a system must be adaptable and through various architectural approaches. However, recent experiences have shown these approaches to be inadequate, at least as currently practiced. This session presents some principles of evolutionary architecture that enable systems to respond to change without needing to predict the future. The presentation then describes three approaches that realize these principles and discusses how these approaches support system adaptability in an evolutionary way.\n\n\nAuthor:\nRebecca Parsons\nDr. Rebecca Parsons is ThoughtWorks' Chief Technology Officer.
