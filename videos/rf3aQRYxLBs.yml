description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2015.\nTrack: Data / Integration\nSpeaker: Christoph Strobl\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/boot-your-search-with-spring\nAbstract:\nSearch has become a major part in our applications. We want to find, quick and easy!  This session focuses on integrating search solutions like Solr, Elasticsearch as well as MongoDBs full text search into your application. We’ll have a look on Spring Data’s abstraction for those and do some hands on auto configuration using Spring Boot (100% XML free setup guaranteed)."
