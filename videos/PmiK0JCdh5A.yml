description: "by Igor Chubin\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/H.2215/console_services.webm\n\n\nThe talk is devoted to console oriented services, like: wttr.in, cheat.sh, rate.sx.\nWhich popular console oriented services exist currently and how can they be used in everyday life;\nwhat advantages and disadvantages do they have; how services like that could be created. I've created several console oriented services,\nthat you are probaly aware of, if you are a vivid\nconsole user. \n\nIf you've never heard about them, you can try to do\nthe following in your terminal, just to get the first impression: \n\n``` \n\n$ curl wttr.in/Karlsruhe\n$ curl rate.sx/btc\n$ curl cheat.sh/lua/:learn\n\n\n``` \n\nAs we will see, in many cases services creaated using this approach\nhas many advantages comparing to browser-orineted services:\n* speed;\n* portability;\n* small footprint and ubiquituous of the client;\n* good possibility of integration;\n* consciosness;\n* anonimity;\n* etc. \n\nIn the talk I will demostrate several popular\nconsole oriented services, that I've created, and tell:\n* how such services could be created,\n* what tasks could be and should be solved by means of them;\n* what advantages (and disatvantages) do they have;\n* what changes in curl we are currently doing, to make such services\neven easier to use, and even more universal and pervasive. \n\nThe talk will be accompanied with many technical examples\nand useful practical tips and tricks such as: \n\n\nhow to make weather forecast using nothing else but curl; \nhow to bring any text from you console one your smartphone\n  using nothing else but curl; \nhow to find an answer to (almost) any programming question\n  not leaving your editor; \n\n\n\nand many other like that. \n\nI would be happy to share my ideas with you, discuss them\nand get some feedback from you during this discussion. \n\nRoom: H.2215 (Ferrer)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 10:40:00+01"
