description: 'Nowadays a lot of websites try to guess what we could like: "Recommendation for you in books" "People you may like" Sounds familiar, isn''t it? Wouldn''t be cool if you could do the same in your application? Well, this session is for you! In the first part of this talk recommendation systems will be introduced, focusing on collaborative filtering algorithms (CR). After that we''ll dive in Prediction.io, an open source machine learning server for software developers to create predictive features, such as personalization, recommendation, and content discovery.'
