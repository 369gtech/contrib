recordingDate: 1382972756
description: "Slides: http://slid.es/forresto/jsconf-2013/fullscreen#/\nMeemoo.org is a sandbox for making creative image and animation hacking apps. The framework has a collection of modules (custom elements) that can be connected with wires (event listeners) that represent the data flow. The design of the framework encourages experimentation in different ways than working with code. It also enforces strict modular software design. Meemoo can be wired to make a stop-motion GIF maker, VJ software, textile pattern design, and more.\n\nExamples: http://meemoo.org/hack-our-apps/\n\nSource: http://2013.jsconf.eu/speakers/forrest-oliphant-vjjs-design-for-hackability-and-data-flow-programming-in-the-browser.html\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
