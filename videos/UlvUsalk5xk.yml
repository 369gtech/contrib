title: 'Anders and Roger discussing the fearless organization'
recordingDate: 1631854793
description: "We have become masters at setting goals. On just about everything. Do you want to be successful? Then you have to set goals!\n\nBut what happens when we set goals in an organization where silence is safe, where we choose comfort over courage, and safe is simply better than sorry? What happens to us as humans when we fail to speak up? What happens to our companies? And what happens to our goals?\n\nMaking the environment safe for open communication about challenges, concerns, and opportunities is not a nice-to-have, it's a vital leadership responsibility.\n\nJoin us and listen to our discussion about this super-important topic!\n___________________________\nFoo Café is a meeting place for people with an interest in software development and IT. \nHere, user groups and partner companies find the perfect atmosphere for sharing knowledge and develop competence. \nFoo Café is open for everyone and is free to attend. To make an event at Foo Café, you have to become a partner company with us or you can run a user group with an in-depth technical focus.\nWe welcome companies with sponsor challenges.\nWe are currently present in Stockholm and Malmö and have made over 2048 tech events since the start in 2012. \nAt Foo Café there’s an event going on everyday, year round."
