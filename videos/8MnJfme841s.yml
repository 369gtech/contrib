description: "At JSConf 2014, I debuted a NodeBots Dress. It had some issues, but overall it worked well and I had a TON of fun building it.\n\nWhen I got home, I thought \"What do I need to make a full NodeBots...outfit?\"\n\nAnd the work truly began.\n\nThis talk will walk through the ideas, construction, and javascript-ification of my NodeBots outfit: from the beginnings and dress v0.1 to my current iteration of a full outfit. Hopefully you'll learn about wearable technology, NodeBots platforms, and how you, too, can have a NodeBots wardrobe."
