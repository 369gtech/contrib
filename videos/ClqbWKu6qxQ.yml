description: "I'm going to walk you through the wilds of data handling in react. I say “the wilds” because when you first look at the landscape, it seems to be overflowing with an untamed profusion of different options. It's hard to figure out why you might want to use any one in particular.\n\nWhen you look closer, you'll see that it's actually easier to navigate than you might think. You just need a good guide."
