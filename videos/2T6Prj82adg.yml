description: "Filmed at http://2015.dotgo.eu in Paris on November 9, 2015. More talks at http://thedotpost.com\n\nWe struggle to conceptualize large software systems. This is a barrier to entry for new contributors and a large source of software errors. Can we build tools that help developers build mental models and understand unfamiliar complex codebases?"
