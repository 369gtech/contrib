description: "Please Note: The audio was recorded over a phone line and is not HD quality. \r\nThe specifics of a cloud's computing architecture may have an impact on application design. This is particularly important in Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud environments. This presentation analyzes aspects of the Amazon EC2 IaaS cloud environment that differ from a traditional data center and introduces general best practices for ensuring data privacy, storage persistence, and reliable DBMS backup. Best practices for application robustness and scalability on demand are reviewed and are especially significant in leveraging the full potential of an IaaS cloud. The need for a cloud application management and configuration system is briefly reviewed and two alternate approaches to cloud application management are described (RightScale and Kaavo)."
