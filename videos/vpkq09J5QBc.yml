It is the one that is most adaptable to change\".\n\nProject Amber is transforming Java's basic language constructs and introducing features to enhance productivity and coding experience. Join this session to stay ahead of the curve as Java adapts to the changing technology landscape and becomes more relevant than ever.\n\nThe audience will take away why, how, and where to use these language modifications that will transform your everyday coding experience. You'll see for yourself if it is worthwhile adopting all these new features."
