They are a new way to write asynchronous and non-blocking code. They can be thought of as light-weight threads without having to deal with all the problems that threads bring to the table. In this talk Marcin shows how to use Kotlin Coroutines and what makes them so special and so efficient.\n\nGeneral Partner – Verv (https://verv.com/) \nVideo Partner – Instabug (https://instabug.com/)"
