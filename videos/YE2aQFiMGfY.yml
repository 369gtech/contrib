description: "Fool-Proof Kubernetes Dashboards for Sleep-Deprived Oncalls - David Kaltschmidt, Grafana Labs \n\nSoftware running on Kubernetes can fail in various, but surprisingly well-defined ways. In this intermediate-level talk David Kaltschmidt shows how structuring dashboards in a particular way can be a helpful guide when you get paged in the middle of the night. Reducing cognitive load makes oncall more effective. When dashboards are organized hierarchically on both the service and the resource level, troubleshooting becomes an exercise of divide and conquer. The oncall person can quickly eliminate whole areas of problems and zone in on the real issue. At that point a single service or instance should have been identified, for which more detailed debugging can take place. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPbv"
