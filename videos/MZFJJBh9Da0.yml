Lots of places are better than this. They have workflow systems, ETL pipelines, analytics teams, data scientists etc. But, can they say months later which version of which code running on what data generated insights? Can they be reproduced? What if the algorithms change? Do you go back and re-run everything? \nScience itself has a reproducibility problem, but it’s worse in most companies and mistakes can be expensive.\n\nThere is a useful subset of data pipelines, let's call them “pure”, that only depend on the data flowing through them. For pure pipelines we can use techniques from distributed build systems to allow us to know what code was used for each step, not lose any previous results as we improve our algorithms and avoid repeating work that has been done already.\n\nThis talk contains interesting theory but is resolutely practical and with concrete examples in several languages and distributed computation frameworks.\n\nSlides & full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/tom-hall/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - TOM HALL\nTheatre fan, occasional mountaineer, part-time runner, thoroughly nice chap, available in fine bookstores everywhere.\n\nTom is well known to those that know him well - an occasional mountaineer, part-time cyclist and part-time typer-at-a-computer doing a mix of dev and ops since before DevOps was a thing. At the moment he's interested in generative art, Elixir and Julia and has been a little bit obsessed with using ideas from functional programming and distributed build systems to make data pipelines and ETL workflows better.\n\nMore on Tom Hall: https://codesync.global/speaker/tom-hall/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE MESH LDN 19\nCode Mesh LDN is powered by Code Sync.
