description: "Google Tech Talk\nJanuary 16, 2014\n(Click \"Show More\" for abstract and speaker info)\nPresented by Mike Rustici\n\nABSTRACT\n\nWe use learning systems to capture and quantify what people learn. Today these systems only have visibility into a tiny fraction of a person’s knowledge and learning experiences. \n\nThe Tin Can API is changing that. This new API provides a common language for describing experience to talk about the things people are doing and what they are learning.\n\nTin Can is enabling a wave of disruption and innovation in the online learning industry. Learning systems are transitioning from monolithic LMSs to a collection of best of breed services that are “tightly coupled, yet loosely integrated”. \n\nThis Tech Talk will describe the transformative effect of the Tin Can API and how it is changing the way we learn.\n\nSpeaker Info:\n\nMike Rustici (mike.rustici@scorm.com)\nMike struck out on his own in 2002 with the intent of building web-based software for people as a contractor. Mike’s experience with SCORM, dating back to 2000, quickly led to high demand for his insight, solutions, and products.\n\nAt Rustici Software, Mike’s collar sets him apart from the rest of the crew. Mike is regularly mocked in the office for being among the top five SCORM/Tin Can professionals in the world. This is only funny because it is probably true.\n\nTim Martin (tim.martin@scorm.com)\nTim joined Mike in 2003, adding the exciting LLC part of the Rustici Software LLC name. Mike and Tim had spent several years together at PureSafety collectively deciding what they believed to be good software architecture, great company leadership, and a fun place to work.\n\nWhile Tim used to be a software developer, he has fallen gracefully into the world of sales. If you’re looking to buy something from Rustici Software, play an inane game, or just get a plainspoken answer to a SCORM or Tin Can API question, Tim is the right person to talk to."
