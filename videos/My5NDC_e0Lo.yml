With the growing number of microservices in a cluster, scalability is one of the core pillars for a fault-tolerant application. Additionally, from a technological landscape standpoint, the cloud platform teams are highly focused on delivering scalable, reliable and highly available platforms. Scalability on the Kubernetes clusters can be approached on the application level and cluster level. While the application level scaling techniques (e.g. HPA and VPA) are widely used, Federation v2 and Cluster API are emerging tools that still prove their worth in a production setup."
