title: 'Building Crossplatform Mobile Apps with the Rhodes Framework'
recordingDate: 1237856630
description: "Google Tech Talks\nMarch 4, 2009\n\nABSTRACT\n\nRhodes is an open source Ruby-based MVC framework for building locally executing, device-optimized mobile applications which run on all smartphone devices. It is similar concept to frameworks such as Rails, Merb and Django but is much lighterweight in order to run locally on smartphones with limited memory and resources.\n\nRhodes is primarily targeted at applications that work with synchronized local data from server application backends, using the other source component RhoSync . Rhodes also allows you to take advantage of native device capabilities such as GPS, PIM contacts and camera. Yet the majority of your interface development is done by modifying HTML templates. Rhodes is available for iPhone, Windows Mobile and Research in Motion, Symbian and Android smartphones. In this session we'll demonstrate building a mobile app from scratch which runs on all of these devices.\n\nRhomobile is the open mobile framework company. Our mission is to build open source components to facilitate building crossplatform mobile apps quickly and with a great user experience. Our components include the Rhodes framework, the RhoSync synchronization server and the RhoVer mobile app provisioning server.\n\nSpeaker: Adam Blum\nCurrently CEO of stealth mode mobile software platform startup. Formerly the VP of Engineering of Mobio and Engineering director for Good Technology. Ultramarathoner, author and adjunct professor at Carnegie Mellon West and UC Berkeley."
