recordingDate: 1557110999
description: "\"Speaker: Jenna Quindica\n\nPeople live with mental health stigma because we learn that we're supposed to be strong and resilient. It's okay not to be strong or resilient all the time. Discussing mental illness is uncomfortable. In this talk, I will help you overcome that discomfort by examining the most common mental health issues, how you can get help for yourself, and how you can best support your coworkers, friends, and family. No one should have to deal with mental illness alone. Bring your tissues.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2019 and https://github.com/PyCon/2019-slides\""
