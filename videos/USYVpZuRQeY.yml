language: English
recordingDate: 1499420057
description: "Spring I/O 2017 - 18 -19 May, Barcelona\n\nThe last couple of years we have been adopting Microservices but mainly for our backend services. When thinking of the frontend we most of the time end up with a monolithic web application which utilizes our modulair backend.\n\nIn this talk we will explore how we could use microservices to our advantage and also split up our frontend so that we can leverage the full power of microservices in both the backend and frontend.\n\nWe will explore how the use of some JavaScript techniques combined with progressive enhancement and following web standards help us in creating a modular / Composite UI."
