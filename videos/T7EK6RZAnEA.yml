description: "In this talk I'll be:\n\n* reviewing the principles of performance profiling perl applications\n* demonstrating how to use Devel::NYTProf\n* demonstrating the new features of version 5\n* explaining common traps when interpreting profile reports\n* describing a multi-phase approach to optimizing applications\n\nNote that the talk is almost unchanged from last year so if you've seen it before there's little reason to see it again."
