recordingDate: 1395847971
description: 'In Erlang there are different types on concurrent entities, processes, ports etc. Each of which can have millions of instances that have to be mapped out to make optimal usage of the hardware. In this presentation I will give an overview of all the different types and attempt to explain how the Erlang VM decides what should run where and when.'
