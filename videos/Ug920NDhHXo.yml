description: "Erlang Factory SF Bay Area 2013\nMore info and slides on the website: http://www.erlang-factory.com/conference/SFBay2013/talks\n\nThis is a story of how a large-scale data collection system that used to run on 1000 nodes was redesigned to run on only a handful of nodes.\n\nThe highly concurrent soft real-time system presented in the talk is used for reliably collecting 10s of terabytes of data from 100s of thousands of sources every day.\n\nWe will talk about various challenges of building and scaling the system in Erlang and speculate about advantages and limitations of Erlang stack for modern server-side development."
