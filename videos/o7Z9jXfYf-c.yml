description: "'O Deep Thought computer,' he said,\n'the task we have designed you to perform is this. We want you to tell us....' he paused,\n'The Answer.'\n'The Answer?' said Deep Thought. 'The Answer to what?'\n'Life!' urged Fook.\n'The Universe!' said Lunkwill.\n'Everything!' they said in chorus.\nDeep Thought paused for a moment's reflection.\n'Tricky,' he said finally.\n'But can you do it?'\nAgain, a significant pause.\n'Yes,' said Deep Thought, 'I can do it.'\n'There is an answer?' said Fook with breathless excitement.\n'Yes,' said Deep Thought. 'Life, the Universe, and Everything. There is an answer. But, I'll have to think about it.'\n?
