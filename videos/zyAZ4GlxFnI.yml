description: 'Servers kill your productivity. Rather than building software, you end up maintaining computers. Wasn''t the "cloud" supposed to fix this? It sounded so promising until we realised it was just renting VMs in a remote datacenter. We couldn''t escape "servers". Until now! In this session, we''ll learn how to build microservices without servers, using modern serverless platforms. We’ll look at common challenges (and solutions) to building applications using serverless stacks. Exploring serverless design patterns will give developers the knowledge to build architectures using these new platforms.'
