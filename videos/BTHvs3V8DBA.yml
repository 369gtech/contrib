description: "Google Tech Talks\r\nNovember 13, 2007\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nYahoo!'s Exceptional Performance Team has identified 14 best practices for making web pages faster. These best practices have proven to reduce response times of Yahoo! properties by 25-50%. They focus on the front-end, for example, why it's bad to use \"@import\" for including stylesheets and why ETags disable browser caching. In this talk I'll go in-depth on these best practices and the research behind them. I'll also demonstrate YSlow and do some live performance analysis of popular web sites. \r\nRelevant links:\r\n   Exceptional Performance: http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/\r\n   YSlow: http://developer.yahoo.com/yslow/\r\n\r\nSpeaker: Steve Souders\r\nSteve Souders holds down the job of Chief Performance Yahoo! at Yahoo!
