description: "Google Tech Talks\nMarch 7, 2007\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThe upcoming C++ standard will have many new features, several major and many minor. The major features are concurrency, template concepts, move semantics, generalized constant expressions, automatic variable typing, and garbage collection. We will present an overview of the major features and breeze through a list of other features, commenting on their likeliness to make the standard.\n\nThis is another in the series of talks in Advanced Topics in Programming Languages.
