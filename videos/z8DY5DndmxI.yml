description: "The best way to understand neural networks is to get your hands dirty and write one.\nIn this session, I'll show you how to code up a neural net for image recognition from scratch - all in C#, and without using any libraries. From the bottom up, we'll discover gradient descent, activation functions, and backpropagation.\n\nWe'll work entirely in LINQPad - with no complex maths, no Python, and no libraries. And you'll get to keep the code!\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcsydney.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
