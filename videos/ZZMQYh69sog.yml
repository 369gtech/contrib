description: 'Working on a product from envisioning to going it live a Product Owner with a team have dealings with the big amount of data. Let''s walk through visualization - a key lean technique which allows information tells us exciting stories. A practical session in a format of talk which would be interesting for Product Owners, Scrum Masters or any persons who want to discover hidden problems faster. Timelines, scatterplots, sparklines -- these and other instruments can be used in daily work when you brainstorm and fill up a backlog, collaborate on product ideas and track the progress. I will finish off by sharing some of unexpected use of boards, timelines and data organisation so that you end up having fewer reports, but each of them would open the eyes on very concrete problems.'
