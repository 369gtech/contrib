description: "How do you grapple with a legacy portfolio? What strategies do you employ to get an application to cloud native?\n\nThis talk will cover tools, process and techniques for decomposing monolithic applications to Cloud Native applications running on Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF). The webinar will build on ideas from seminal works in this area: Working Effectively With Legacy Code and The Mikado Method. We will begin with an overview of the technology constraints of porting existing applications to the cloud, sharing approaches to migrate applications to PCF. Architects & Developers will come away from this webinar with prescriptive replatforming and decomposition techniques. These techniques offer a scientific approach for an application migration funnel and how to implement patterns like Anti-Corruption Layer, Strangler, Backends For Frontend, Seams etc., plus recipes and tools to refactor and replatform enterprise apps to the cloud. Go beyond the 12 factors and see WHY Cloud Foundry is the best place to run any app - cloud native or non-cloud native.\n\nSpeakers: Pieter Humphrey, Consulting Product Marketing Manager; Pivotal\nRohit Kelapure, PCF Advisory Solutions Architect; Pivotal\n\nHungry for more?
