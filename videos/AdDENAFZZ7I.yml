description: "From the world leading expert in Agile and Neuroscience combination Anna Obukhova! \n\nGraduated from the Neuroleadership Institute and gained the actual knowledge of how understanding the brain helps to influence the efficiency of the processes.\n\nThis training two day training can help you to understand what are the scientific -biological reasons for the team not to perform at their best. \n\nIntended audience is: Scrum Masters, Agile Leaders (managers), team members, people from any department of your organisation will benefit from understanding why carrot and a stick do not work as intended and what can you do to actually help your team(s) to improve. \n\n\nJust read some of the feedback from previous trainings done by Anna:\n\nInstructor has an excellent psychological, physiological, as well as managerial component, and what is more important - is able to deliver content in an entertaining way. The training, as it seems to me, is more important to myself, helps to think about the personal performance and condition.\nLiked the parallels between myself and the team the most, deep individuality in terms of performance.\n\nLiked the emphasis specifically on the neurobiological basis.\nTake this course. Difficult to describe in words.\n\nUnique training from the professional working on the edge of biology, management sciences, Agile.\n\nVarious practically useful techniques for the work with people. Theory fits well with the personal experience. Recommended.\n\nMany things became clear, great value, thank you!\n\nThe course helps to achieve not only the better productivity, but also to know yourself, own strengths and weakness, to learn how to cope with failures in a healthy way and productively get out of any situation. Something, that should be definitely teached to kids and parents during their adaptation (psychology of success, achievement of goals, result etc.).\nI learned the theory, that will allow to develop own tools. Pointed out actions aimed to increase personal efficiency, figured out how to improve the processes in a team.\nEach topic hits the bullâ€™s eye. Perfect content delivery, the concentration of useful knowledge was fascinating.\nLiked the novelty of the content, delivery, depth. Saturated with the scientifically proven information. Works with the mindsets, beliefs and values. Thank you!\n\nSomething that every Scrum Master should know.\nA unique content of the concentrated usefulness.\nThis is a training on how to assess the performance of people and teams whom you work with. You will learn what helps and what hurts in supporting of performance, and how to develop your team from the performance and energy perspective."
