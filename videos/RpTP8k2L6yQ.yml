title: 'PEPR ''20 - Design of a Privacy Infrastructure for the Internet of Things'
language: English
recordingDate: 1602878139
description: "Design of a Privacy Infrastructure for the Internet of Things\n\nNorman Sadeh, Carnegie Mellon University\n\nWe have recently launched a Privacy Infrastructure for the Internet of Things. The infrastructure revolves around a growing collection of registries where owners of IoT resources (e.g. IoT devices, services) and volunteer contributors can publicize the presence of IoT resources and their data practices, including any privacy settings made available by these resources. An IoT Privacy Assistant app available in the iOS store and Android Google Play store enables people to discover IoT resources around them, find out about the data they collect and interact with privacy settings made available by these resources. In this presentation, we will discuss some of the the design challenges associated with the development of such a platform and how we approached these challenges as we developed a first instance of this technology. Within a month, our user community has grown to over 15,000 users, with our infrastructure hosting over 100,000 IoT resource descriptions.\n\nView the full PEPR '20 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/pepr20/conference-program"
