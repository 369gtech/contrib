description: "Domain-Driven Design Europe 2019\nhttps://dddeurope.com\nhttps://twitter.com/ddd_eu\n\nUncompromised Agile is Safer and Better for Regulated Medical Products (Talk)\n\nAs a software tech lead building many safety-critical products, I \nimmediately saw the “other” benefits of Agile – the way that speed to \nmarket is merely a side effect of doing the deeper engineering work more \nthoroughly (while avoiding gold-plating and blind alleys, etc.!)\n\nNow, as someone coaching teams and managers in medical and other \nsafety-critical work, there is good news: Regulatory bodies in both the \nEU and USA are able to recognize this same insight. It’s built into \ntheir operating rules in many ways. If you are starting to work with a \nmedical device company in any role, this session will explore some key \nthings you need to know for helping them move to Agile practices:\n\n• Agile is preferred by regulatory bodies for risk mitigation, done \nincrementally\n• Every Agile Demo can be a regulatory formal design review with just \nminimal added steps\n• Documentation is streamlined by the Agile practices we all know, but \nthere are a few further tips to be aware of when Agile companies submit \ndocumentation to regulators\n• Examples will be given of Agile medical device companies using all \nthese ideas\n\nBiography \n\nNancy Van Schooenderwoert does Agile Enterprise coaching— everything from launching new agile technical teams to advising executives on how to take Agile and Lean principles far beyond software development in their drive to deliver more customer value faster. She works with large and small companies. Nancy pioneered agile practices for embedded software development beginning in 1998. Her background in electronics and software development for avionics, factory automation, medical, and defense systems brings a unique perspective to her coaching practice.\n\nNancy holds a Scrum Master certification, has edited a column for the Agile Times, and served on the IEEE 1648 committee to define a standard for customers of agile teams. She has been a regular presenter at various Agile-related conferences since 2003. Her work in applying Agile methods to embedded systems has been referenced by Jim Shore and Mary Poppendieck in their books. She is a founder and past president of Agile New England, Boston's largest Agile professional group.\n\nCurrently based in greater Boston, USA."
