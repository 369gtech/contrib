recordingDate: 1506519160
description: "In this session you will learn how you can utilize following DevOps & general tools to implement Continuous Delivery pipelines in immutable infrastructure:\n\nDocker\nPacker\nTerraform\nAnsible\nContainer orchestration solutions (Kubernetes, etc)\nJenkins 2 pipelines\nNexus\nRundeck\nMakefiles\nWe'll create fully working enterprise-grade Continuous delivery system from zero with the single command and after that, we'll analyze everything we did in details.\n\nHands-on samples will be used during the session. I will explain and show examples of following principles/best practices in action:\n\nInfrastructure as a Code\nImmutable infrastructure (vs Mutable infrastructure)\nConfiguration as a Code\nDelivery pipelines as a Code\nAutomation of everything\nAuto testing infrastructure changes\nAfter that, we'll learn how to avoid bad practices/pains\_like:\n\nSnowflake servers\nFragile infrastructure\nProducing technical debt\nConfiguration drift\nManual configuration management\nManual deployment processes\nAlso, we'll check how to create Continuous deployment pipelines for the infrastructure itself!\n\nAcquia hosting will be used as a target for the deployments."
