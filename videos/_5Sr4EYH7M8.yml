description: "Roy Williams (Facebook)\n\nFacebook doesn't have a test organization, developers own everything from writing their code to testing it to shepherding it into production. That doesn’t mean we don’t test! The way that we’ve made this scale has been through automating the lifecycle of tests to keep signal high and noise low. New tests are considered untrusted and flakiness is quickly flushed out of the tree. We’ll be talking about what’s worked and what hasn’t to build trust in tests."
