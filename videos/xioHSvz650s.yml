description: "License is a Nuisance! - Ramya Shenoy & Maryam Labib, Pivotal \n\nContainers are available on the internet, or you can build them from scratch, or you could even build upon an existing one. You may have seen a container with a base OS image and then packages that get installed on it. These packages could be open source or closed source. When you get a container, you may not know exactly what’s on its file system. And when you’re a company, how do you know that you have the legal right to ship and distribute that container? That's why companies have to go through an Open Source Licensing process to license the software on their container images. In this talk, Ramya and Maryam explain why licensing is crucial and yet difficult when it comes to containers. You will learn about the whole process of figuring out what makes a container, finding the packages included on it and finding licenses for those software packages. \n\nFor more info: https://www.cloudfoundry.org/"
