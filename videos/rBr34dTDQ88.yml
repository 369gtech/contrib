title: 'Lambda Jam 2015 - Jeffrey Smith - Reactive Machine Learning'
recordingDate: 1445131342
description: "The reactive manifesto has sparked off a ton of excitement around building modern distributed systems using functional programming principles. But how can the reactive principles be applied to the most exciting app in all of big data: machine learning?\n\nIn this talk, I’ll walk through in detail how to build machine learning applications that are responsive, resilient, elastic, and messagedriven. We’ll see how reactive machine learning system build on important concepts such as futures, actors, and supervision but require modern implementations such as Scala futures, Akka, and Spark. Building a reactive machine learning system is ultimately an architectural problem, and this talk will discuss the relationship between reactive systems architectures and other important architectural patterns such as the Lambda Architecture, Event Sourcing, and CQRS.\n\nExamples will be shown in Scala using Spark with a focus on how functional programming idioms enable the implementation of reactive machine learning systems.\n\nI’m a data engineer at Intent Media, building large scale machine learning systems. Over the past decade or so, I’ve written all sorts of datacentric systems for startups in New York City, San Francisco, and Hong Kong. Most of my thoughts on how to engineer data systems wind up on Medium or the Intent Media tech blog. When I’m not diving deep into data architectures, I’m usually drawing comics about New York or data science.\n\nFor more on Lambda Jam, visit http://www.lambdajam.com"
