description: "This talk took place at CukenFest London 2019, our annual conference for BDD enthusiasts. More info here - http://cukenfest.cucumber.io\n\nHaving a good example-driven conversation can be messy. Humans scribble on whiteboards, rip up index cards, and stick things to the wall.\n\nAutomating examples brings huge benefits, but forcing them into linear Gherkin doesn't always feel natural. We'll explore some more natural visual formats for examples, and how they can practically be used to drive tests.\n\nSlides - https://speakerdeck.com/cucumberbdd/doodle-driven-development-ciaran-mcnulty"
