description: "27 years ago I published “Why Functional Programming Matters”, a manifesto for FP–but the subject is much older than that! In this talk I’ll take a deep dive into its history, highlighting some of the classic papers of the subject, personal favourites, and some of my own work. At the end of the day, four themes emerge that characterize what I love about the subject.\n\nJohn Hughes has been a functional programming enthusiast for more than thirty years, at the Universities of Oxford, Glasgow, and since 1992 Chalmers University in Gothenburg, Sweden. He served on the Haskell design committee, co-chairing the committee for Haskell 98, and is the author of more than 75 papers, including “Why Functional Programming Matters“, one of the classics of the area. With Koen Claessen, he created QuickCheck, a property based testing tool for Haskell. It has become the defacto testing tool for FP and more recently for many other languages. In 2006 he founded Quviq to commercialise the technology for Erlang and C – Testing the Hard Stuff and Staying Sane.\n\nFor more on YOW! Lambda Jam, visit http://lamdajam.yowconference.com.au"
