description: "Everything We Did Wrong to Do Accessibility Right at BuzzFeed\n\nPlum Ertz, Ro, and Jack Reid, BuzzFeed\n\nOver the past two years, BuzzFeed's main hub of \"\"listicles\"\" and quizzes has been picked apart by third-party auditors and mindfully reconstructed to meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility success criteria by its tech team. From day one, the remediation and certification process was a case study in building accessibility from solid moral grounds and shaky organizational ones. Our team is proud of our work, but we did quite a bit wrong to get it right. In this talk, we'll share what we've learned from our mistakes so that you can avoid the same ones on your own compliance journey, and set yourself up for long-term success in building accessible culture.\n\nView the full LISA21 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa21/program"
