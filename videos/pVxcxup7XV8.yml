title: 'How to Orchestrate a Robotic Swarm by Matt Whelan'
recordingDate: 1581884592
description: "Ocado Technology develops in-house almost all the technology that powers the ecommerce, fulfilment and logistics platforms for Ocado.com, the world's largest online-only grocery retailer.\n\nOur business runs at the intersection of five disruptive technologies â€“ the Internet of Things, Cloud Computing, Big Data, Robotics and Artificial Intelligence.\n\nOur giant fulfillment centres are full of smart mobile robots, plugged into the world around them, streaming their data to the cloud and powering the digital twins we use to design and optimise them.\n\nWe use Java to build the AI system that orchestrates these swarms of robots. With the JVM and discrete event simulation, coupled with a sophisticated CI pipeline, we can stress tests our algorithms through thousands of hours of simulated operation before deployment.\n\nJava offers the balance between elegant abtractions for algorithm design, with a level of control that lets us write deterministic systems that are easy to debug, maintain and measure. It also lets us work at a high level while offering the performance we need to orchestrate fleets of thousands of bots in real time.\n\nThese capabilities enable an empirical, data driven approach to warehouse and algorithm design, which gives us the edge in the competitive, low margin, growing online grocery market.\n\nIn this talk, we will explore why Java is the right technology for systems like ours, and share some of the things we've learnt from creating industrial control systems at a massive scale.\n\nMatt Whelan\nOcado Technology\n\nRecorded at Jfokus 2020 in Stockholm 5th of february\nhttp://www.jfokus.se"
