description: "If there's one challenge with bots, that has to be how effortless and smooth the interaction between the user and the bot has to be. The user shouldn't even feel like conversing with a program. That's why thinking about how to handle the conversation flow when building bots is an essential task for developers. In this talk, we will go through how to manage the conversation flow with Microsoft Bot Framework and dialogs. We will tackle some scenarios like prompt input, validate input, multiple dialogs, handling the context etc.\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
