description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nRunning High-performance User-space Packet Processing Apps in Kubernetes - Abdul Halim, Intel & Peng Liu, Red Hat  \n\nWith 5G on the horizon, networking is transforming around us. Network functions have already found their way from proprietary blackbox into servers running in Linux. The Linux networking stack simply cannot keep up with increasing demands for higher throughput and lower latency of these packet flows. The packet processing pipeline is now run in userspace instead, bypassing the kernel. DPDK provides an environment and API to run high-intensive packet processing in userspace. Many CNFs are developed using DPDK. A DPDK application requires specific resources from a host for guaranteed performance. Deploying and running such applications in K8s is always a challenging task.  In this presentation & demo, users will learn about open source technologies and components and how to leverage them to deploy workloads that requires high performance networking infrastructure in a Kubernetes cluster. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Uacf"
