description: "As we marvel at the true apex predators in the threat actor menagerie, part of their charm lies in the ability to productionize the development of exemplary operations. Their operations are systematic: relying on layers of abstraction meant to simultaneously scale to accommodate untold numbers of targets while also ‘idiotproofing’ for future generations of government-paid operators of every ilk. Codifying a culture of malware development and deployment a cut above more ‘artisanal’ malware ops presents interesting opportunities for malware paleontologists looking to understand the relationships between campaigns, malware families, and sometimes even between standalone threat actors.\n\nThis talk will focus on how particular threat actors have approached this mass production of high-end malware and what analysts can determine (at a technical level) when threat actors collaborate towards a common goal via a previously undisclosed missing link.\n\n=== \n\nJuan Andrés is a security researcher focused on tracking cyberespionage groups. He’s an adjunct professor of Strategic Studies at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) and private consultant.
