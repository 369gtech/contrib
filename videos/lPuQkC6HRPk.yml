description: "When you begin programming in JavaScript, you'll need to use variables. A variable is just a bit of storage to hold a value. Just about every line of code you write will use a variable of one kind or another, so it's a good idea to get familiar with the kinds of things you can put in variables, and how you can use them. Now, if you're coming from another programming language, like Java, you might be surprised to see how loose JavaScript is about variables and their types; JavaScript doesn't care if your variable starts out with a string value, and ends up being a number: JavaScript's dynamically typed.  \n\nIn this installment of Head First JavaScript Programming Teasers, you'll learn about the basics of variables, how JavaScript is dynamically typed, and why it's a good idea to stick with one type for your variables."
