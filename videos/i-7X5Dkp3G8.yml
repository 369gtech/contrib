description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nSponsored Keynote: The Next Epoch of Technology: Wasm & Actors - Liam Randall, Founder, Cosmonic\n\nThe last 20 years of technology have been defined by the rise of dominant abstractions of technology.  Virtual machines freed us from the constraints of a specific computer with portable machine images, containers freed us from a specific Linux distribution giving us portable environments, and Kubernetes frees us from a specific cloud giving us portable workload orchestration.  The next great abstraction is the application library - freeing us from the constraints of a specific implementation and services.  In this talk we will highlight the emerging opportunity and advantages of abstracting away from specific cloud capabilities to actor models."
