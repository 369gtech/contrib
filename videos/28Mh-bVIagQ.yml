description: "This presentation was recorded at Voxxed Days Belgrade 2016 - https://belgrade.voxxeddays.com/\n\nNowdays, when someone mentions mobile and native development in the same sentence, there is an unpleasant thought that these two are not meant to be together. If you want to have portable code on every mobile platform, C++ can be a good choice."
