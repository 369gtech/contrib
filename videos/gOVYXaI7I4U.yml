Fan of distributed ‘everything’, FP novice. Got Computer Science education at AGH University of Science and Technology. Currently gathering experience working on advertisements platform at e-commerce company.\n\nTracing of Large-scale Actor Systems\n\nIn the case of actor systems there are situations that processing within one of the actors fails because of failures that happened earlier in the system. It is difficult to trace down the origin of the failure and fix the mistake. This problem can be solved by collecting traces of messages passed between actors. However, this becomes a challenge when actor systems used in production are of large scale. In this paper, we provide a tool for tracing distributed actor systems - Akka Tracing Tool."
