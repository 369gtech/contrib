description: "Learn Live: Foundations of Data Science for Machine Learning - Create and understand classification models in machine learning: October 19 – Episode 06\n\nJoin the chat and ask questions live at https://aka.ms/LearnLiveTV\n\nStarting Tuesday, September 14, 2021 (PST), join Jason DeBoever and Glenn Stephens live on Learn TV and explore this nine-part “Foundations of data science for machine learning” series. Each week, we will be walking through Learn modules and answering your questions live. From basic classical machine learning models to exploratory data analysis and customizing architectures, you’ll be guided by easy to digest conceptual content and interactive Jupyter notebooks and will learn about the underlying concepts as well as how to get into building models with the most common machine learning tools.\n\nOctober 19 - Episode 6:\nFollow along and complete the free, hands-on Microsoft Learn modules at https://aka.ms/LearnML-Classification\n\nClassification means assigning items into categories or can also be thought of automated decision making. Here we introduce classification models through logistic regression, providing you with a stepping-stone toward more complex and exciting classification methods. In this episode, you will:\n\n- Discover how classification differs from classical regression.\n- Build models that can perform classification tasks.\n- Explore how to assess and improve classification models.\n\nMiss an episode?
