description: "What happens when we start a project from scratch and try to apply all of the best practices? How well do constexpr, noexcept, [[nodiscard]] and other features interact with each other? Is it possible to apply all of the best practices at once, or will they conflict with each other? We will explore current best practices and examine their impact on compile time, runtime and testing. We'll also see some of the unexpected effects that result when best practices are applied to a new project.\n\nEVENT:\n\nCppCon 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nJason Turner\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nCppCon Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video."
