description: "Speaker: Thomas Chia\r\n\r\nPeople say CSS is not a real programming language. People say that if you need to count stuff use JavaScript. In this talk I dispel such myths and will blow at least my own mind as I show how to count with CSS (tldr it’s a quick overview of the counter property. It’s gonna be really short ⚡️).\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/SingaporeCSS/events/261692488/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\r\nRecorded by: Ambrose\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/CF2iX/"
