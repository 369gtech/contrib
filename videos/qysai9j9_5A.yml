title: 'Avoiding problems with CSS at scale: A look at CSS in JS - Therése Barmer'
recordingDate: 1517580801
description: "Anyone who has ever worked on a large product knows the pain of poorly architected CSS. CSS in JS enforces locally-scoped styles by default, by pulling in only the styles necessary for the component, instead of a whole CSS stylesheet.\n\nThis does not mean using inline styles, but instead abstracting style at the component level. In this talk we will explore the main problems caused by using CSS at scale, and look at solutions to these problems involving JavaScript.\n\nTherése Barmer is a certified web developer with a passion for new programming languages and problem solving. At Edument she spends her time developing and teaching web-related courses, along with developing in JavaScript.\n___________________________\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry. Foo Café is aimed at those interested in sharing and learning.\n\nBorn out of the desire to create a year round conference like atmosphere, Foo Café is THE place for planned and spontaneous meetings of all sizes and interests within the IT arena.\nEnjoy a coffee or a cold beer, along with light pub fare, and engage with other like minded individuals interested in sharing their knowledge and learning from one another.
