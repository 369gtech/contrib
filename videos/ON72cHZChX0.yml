description: "While advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence have been occurring at a record pace, these advances have not been widely adopted or embraced in the field of healthcare. I will discuss several roadblocks including data bias, messy or missing data, and the expense of data labeling.\n\nI am an extraordinarily curious data scientist who lives for experimentation with the hope of discovering new ways to make improvements with data and artificial intelligence. I began my AI adventure at Indiana University while completing my Master of Science in Data Science (MSDS). I have been developing and implementing AI systems professionally even before completing my degree (summer 2016). My greatest hope is to infect others with my excitement for all things data.\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
