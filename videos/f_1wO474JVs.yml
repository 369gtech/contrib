language: English
recordingDate: 1601026184
description: "Transformation is a big topic at DATEV in 2020. DATEV Unternehmen online is a DATEV product used by most tax accountants and companies in Germany. In this talk, we’ll share our experience collaborating with Pivotal (now part of VMware), and show that it’s not only a matter of change and modernizing our applications, but also the way we work. We want to share the lessons learned, what works for us in our transformation journey, and how to disrupt our old way of working within our team. Because every team is different, we hope this talk will help many organizations out there in their transformation journey.\n\nFani Bahar, Senior Product Manager at VMware; \nMartin Wolf, Product Owner at DATEV eG\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/transformation-not-only-the-app-but-also-the-way-we-work"
