description: "Changes, even those that represent improvement, are always accompanied by obstacles and discomforts. Kubernetes can become very complex with all the objects that need to be handled in addition to releases that you operate with.\n\nThe goal of this session: address complexity with development passion.\n\nIn this session I will explain and demonstrate live how you can simplify Kubernetes complexity with Helm: templates, values, requirements and pod specifications made easier, maintainable and reusable.\n\nAna-Maria Mihalceanu is a custom application development enthusiast, co-founder of Bucharest Software Craftsmanship Community and a constant adopter of challenging technical scenarios. Some of her older experiments are available on Dzone. In 2016, as tech passionate of cloud application development she achieved IBM Certified Application Developer - Cloud Platform v1. Since then, she has enriched her cloud expertise by learning and certifying as a Salesforce Developer and attained a better understanding on how to integrate different types of cloud offerings. Other passions? The knowledge hunt through reading and growing fashion skills through shopping."
