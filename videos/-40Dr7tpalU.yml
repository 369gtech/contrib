language: English
recordingDate: 1605206177
description: "Authorization with Envoy at Square - Jelle Vanhorenbeke\n\nEvery organization has different authentication and authorization needs and it is not always clear how Envoy can help to abstract this from the application layer. In this talk we will show you how Square leverages Envoy's â€™s ext_authz filter and how our centralized authorization service has become the new source of truth for hundreds of services. We will cover how we migrated multiple authorization libraries to this centralized authorization service and how we rolled out these changes to production. This process has benefited other teams and allowed them to launch new features that were previously not possible."
