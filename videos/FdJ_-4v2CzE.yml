description: 'The future of e-commerce requires personalized content for each individual customer. With over 20 million active users, Zalando is facing the challenge of making its frontends more scalable in order to achieve this goal. We brought a solution from the backend to the frontend: microservices. In addition to creating Project Mosaic (https://www.mosaic9.org)—our solution for modular frontends—and using a toolbox of modern web technologies like React and Webpack, we built an architecture that can scale to virtually any size and even support targets other than the browser.'
