description: "An Open Erlang PaaS Done Right\n\nI'm going to describe the architecture of the Erlang platform that emerges from a toy PaaS to a build-yourself-a-platform product. In the talk I'd like to compare existing ops strategies to operate Erlang software, identify their pitfalls and offer solutions, some of which were implemented in Voxoz. Some of the project outlines can be read at here\nTalk Objectives\n\nLead the audience through:\n\n    development environment disaster porn\n    deployment disaster porn\n    real world Erlang on Xen use scenarios, experience from porting the apps from beam to ling and making the deployment scenarios as close as possible"
