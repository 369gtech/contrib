description: "This video was recorded at Code Elixir LDN 19 \nGet involved in Code Sync’s next conference http://bit.ly/2Mcm4aS\n\n---\nKeynote - Confident Elixir\nby Tetiana Dushenkivska\n\nAre you proud of the code and workflow in your project? Being proud of what you do comes with confidence in the patterns and concepts you choose to follow and your ability to apply them in the project. In this talk, Tetiana will share with the audience what gives her confidence working on the elixircards project. Working with Elixir full time since 2016 on various different projects with different teams, there has been a set of patterns they’ve adopted which she would like to share with the audience through concrete examples.\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTetiana wants the audience to walk away with:\nfeeling motivated to think of, discuss and share the practices they are proud of,\neither be inspired to try something new or feel confident about what they do already \nhave practical examples showing how particular concepts are used in Elixir, making the keynote accessible to developers who are new to Elixir.\n\nAUDIENCE\nBeginners who want to see an example of problems, reasoning and solutions they may experience in their career.\n\nAnyone who is interested in seeing what patterns and concepts are used on another project and why, how we go from idea to a solution, what we tried, what didn’t work and how we solved it.\nFor intermediate and proficient users it may be more of a thought-provoking, rather than learning opportunity, something to discuss with others.\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nhonest, \nthought provoking, \nopinionated\n\nTALK LEVEL: Beginner\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - Tetiana Dushenkivska\nSoftware Engineer\n\nTetiana is a Software Engineer with a passion for challenges and making learning fun. In her free time she contributes to open source and working on her own software/hardware projects. She is interested in the idea of mixing hardware and software together. That's why her personal projects include the integration of Arduino, bunch sensors with visual output to the browser. This allows her to write fun games and enjoy \"testing\" them. \n\nAs a social person, she likes to build social games, which include \"testing\" with friends. After sipping a little bit of Elixir (programming language, not actual booze) she started to fall in love with it. That's the explanation to why all her latest projects include Elixir."
