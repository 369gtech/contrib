title: 'Finding Subtle but Common Concurrency Issues in Java Programs'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433260067
description: "This presentation describes research results on common concurrency mistakes in Java and shows examples in which subtle misunderstandings of the Java concurrency model have caused bugs in widely used open source programs. It further shows how your organization can avoid introducing new instances of these concurrency bugs and how static analysis development testing tools can alert you of a problem before the code has left the programmerâ€™s attention. Mistakes covered include unsafely avoiding taking a lock, poor selection of objects used as locks, and misuse of the wait/notify pattern.\n\n\nAuthor:\nMark Winterrowd\nMark Winterrowd has been discovering bugs in Java programs in desktop, web application, and mobile environments with Coverity since 2010. He has most recently taken charge with enhancing Coverity's concurrency checkers to find race conditions, deadlocks, and other nondeterministic behavior.\nView more trainings by Mark Winterrowd at https://www.parleys.com/author/mark-winterrowd-1\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
