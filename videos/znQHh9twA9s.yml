title: 'Jon Morra: A Data Science Ecosystem to Learn Opinions of Videos'
recordingDate: 1542732109
description: "Understanding which videos people are drawn to is critical to video ad targeting. In order to understand these nuances we need a robust data and machine learning architecture. When designing and implementing a large scale machine learning system there are a number of tradeoffs that must be considered. Tradeoffs such as time to perform research and development (R&D), how to productionalize experiments, and how to assure quality in a production environment. At Zefr we are tasked with understanding people’s preferences of videos, primarily on YouTube, so that we can most effectively match videos with an advertiser’s desired content. \n - Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/crunch"
