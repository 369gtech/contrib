Apparently so. \n\nBlazor is an experimental web application framework out of Microsoft that provides the means to write a Single Page Application using Razor pages and C# running with Web Assembly.\nIn this talk we will go beyond \"Hello World\" and explore what the developer experience is like with Blazor. Where does it shine? What are the pain points and gotchas. How does it compare with the current crop of SPA frameworks/libraries?\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcsydney.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
