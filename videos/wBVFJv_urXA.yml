title: 'Setting Fire To My Desk: Adventures in Redis and Microcontrollers - Kyle Davis'
recordingDate: 1528732148
description: "In this talk, we'll cover connecting a ~$1 microcontroller directly to a Redis server over WiFi: the implementation of the RESP protocol on the microcontroller, building a small sensor circuit, and developing a Node.js-based admin dashboard.\n\nThe presentation will also address the security implications of IoT devices, how to manage battery life even during cold Canadian winters, and, from a philosophical perspective, how to tackle learning new technologies.\n\nI will also talk about how I literally set my desk ablaze during development of the sensor and software."
