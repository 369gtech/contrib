description: "SQL to Edge Keynote:\nSQL is everywhere you need it from the IoT Edge to your data center to public clouds. With all of these options, it can be difficult to know which to choose and why each option may be right for your data needs. In this presentation, I’ll review with you all the current released and preview versions of SQL from the edge to the cloud. I’ll compare each of them and discuss why you want to get ahead of the curve by understanding what is possible with the modern SQL data platform. I’ll discuss the technical details of some of these options so you can understand what SQL \"flavor\" fits your company's needs. This session will include some demos to highlight key innovations with SQL.\n\nBob Ward, Principal Architect Microsoft Azure Data\nMicrosoft\n\nAnna Hoffman, Data & Applied Scientist\nMicrosoft\n\nBuck Woody, Applied Data Scientist\nMicrosoft"
