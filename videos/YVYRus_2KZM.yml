title: 'RailsConf 2020 CE - Encapsulating Views by Joel Hawksley'
language: English
recordingDate: 1588633197
description: "Encapsulating Views by Joel Hawksley\n\nUnlike models and controllers, Rails views are not encapsulated. This makes them hard to reason about and difficult to test, leading us to use abstractions such as presenters and decorators. In this talk, we'll explore the inner workings of how Rails compiles and executes views today, the lessons we've learned building encapsulated views at GitHub over the past year, and how you can do the same with the support for 3rd-party component frameworks coming in Rails 6.1.\n\n__________\n\nJoel is a software engineer at GitHub. He works on the Design Systems team, leading the development of ViewComponent."
