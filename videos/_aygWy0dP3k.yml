description: "The Physical Web is an ultra simple way to find and interact with devices around you, all without ever having to install an app. This talk will introduce you to the Physical Web and also show you how easy it is to add interactivity to devices. We show a demo of a device that initially shows nothing more than a simple web page, but by adding a single Polymer component lets you connect and interact with that device through WebBluetooth.\n\nMissed the summit?
