title: 'YOW! Lambda Jam 2014 - Parametricity, Types are Documentation - Tony Morris'
language: English
recordingDate: 1421921839
description: "This talk will build on the work of Philip Wadler (1) and Danielsson et al (2) to demonstrate using types to document source code behaviour and to assist in reasoning about code. Specifically, the concept of parametricity is used to tacitly eliminate possibilities in code behaviour leaving only a few, sometimes even one, remaining potential candidates.\n\nFor more on YOW!
