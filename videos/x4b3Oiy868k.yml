description: "Podcast #6 is with Tren Black. Tren is a tech youtuber and one of my more vocal critics. We talk about the pros & cons of online courses, Computer Science, our backgrounds, the youtube lifestyle, and he freestyle raps about data structures at the end. I hope you enjoy the conversation as much as I did. \n\nThe future of Education depends on all of us irreverently pushing the boundaries of what is perceived as normal by our peers. Education is not their word to define, it’s yours. We have to learn how to learn using the Internet, questioning every archaic tool that’s being used now, from the physical lecture hall to the proctored exam. Gamify your learning and don’t ever let anyone tell you that you can’t. Computer Science is my one true love, and I refuse to accept that all the ways it's being taught now are enough to educate the world. I want every man, woman, and child on this planet to have basic Computer Science literacy. Knowledge and action are inextricably connected, and the best way to prepare ourselves for the technological changes happening across every spectrum of our lives is with this knowledge. We have to completely reinvent Computer Science Education these next few years, and then the rest of Education will follow.\n\nSubscribe for more educational videos about Computer Science!"
