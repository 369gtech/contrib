title: 'MonetDB/X100: a (very) fast column-store'
recordingDate: 1201085033
description: "Google Tech Talks\nJanuary, 15 2008\n\nABSTRACT\n\nMonetDB/X100 is a second-generation column-store prototyped at CWI, targeted\nat analysis-heavy data management tasks such as data warehousing and\ninformation retrieval.\nIn this overview talk I will outline the research challenges, novel\ntechniques and results from this project. The ideal is to close the existing performance gap between hand-coded\napplicationas and database systems using architecture-conscious techniques,\nand by carefully exploiting the bandwith strengs of modern hardware (and\navoiding its latency weaknesses).\nThe novel techniques presented encompass expressing relational operators as\nvector operations, lightweight compression on the border between CPU cache\nand RAM, sequential-access optimized database design and I/O bandwidth\nsharing.\n\nSpeaker: Peter Boncz"
