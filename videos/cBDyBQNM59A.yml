title: 'Quick Walkthrough of a Google Compute Engine API Sample for Android'
recordingDate: 1384191888
description: "This video is a demo and quick walk through of a code sample showing how to use the Google Compute Engine API on Android. The sample is a simple application that connects to the GCE API for a specific project in order to list running resources and allow them to be stopped or deleted. The full source code can be found at https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/compute-getting-started-android and the README file included in the project should allow you to deploy a copy of the application for your own experimentation purposes.\n\nThis quick video might also be helpful for an Android developer using other Google APIs since it includes updating a gradle build file to use the Java Google Client Library."
