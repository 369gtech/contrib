title: 'CppCon 2017: Kenny Yu “End-to-end Deadlock Debugging Tools at Facebook”'
language: English
recordingDate: 1509211639
description: "Presentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2017\n—\nFacebook has developed tooling to help quickly find and debug several classes of concurrency bugs in Facebook's large C++ codebase. In this talk, we will focus specifically on deadlocks and the tools we use to detect and prevent them. We will explore the various tools we use — some open source tools we have deployed and some we have developed — and how they work by walking through several examples of real-world bugs found by these tools in Facebook's large production systems. \n\nTopics include: \n* How we deploy and utilize ThreadSanitizer on Facebook's large codebase \n* Linux eBPF tools to detect potential deadlocks on running binaries \n* gdb extensions to examine mutex internals to detect deadlocks \n* folly::Synchronized and other libraries that make it more difficult to introduce concurrency bugs \n— \nKenny Yu: Facebook, Software Engineer\n\nKenny Yu is a software engineer at Facebook. In his time there, he has focused on improving testing and developer experience for engineers at Facebook, working on things such as debugging tools and concurrency bug-finders. He currently works on Facebook's cluster manager and container deployment platform.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
