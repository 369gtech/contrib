description: "Chris Sinjakli, SRE at GoCardless\n\nOur discipline is one of tropes and maxims—the commoditisation of infrastructure, the golden signals of monitoring, the breaking down of barriers spurred by DevOps.\n\nSurely there are mistakes we won't make again. Surely we've left the bad times behind.\n\nSome mistakes are just too tempting to avoid.\n\nMotivated by examples from GoCardless—a company founded in 2011—we'll explore three failure modes:\n\ndividing product and infrastructure teams early in the company's life\npinning our hopes on the big rework that never arrives\nforgetting the basics of SRE while seeking out hard problems\nWe'll explore what makes each failure mode so tempting, what it might look like if you're experiencing it, and approaches to dig yourself out.\n\nView the full SREcon18 Asia/Australia Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon18asia/program\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
