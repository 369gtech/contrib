title: 'Deploying Docker for Database DevOps Dominance - Daniel Mallott - NDC Sydney 2020'
language: English
recordingDate: 1630507219
description: 'You benefit from Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment practices to accelerate feature deployment and catch regression issues up front, but your database deployments are still stuck in the proverbial dark ages. You might have build scripts for your database in source control, but deploying is still an exercise in creating the perfect script, and don''t even think about making a data (or data type) change! In this talk, you will learn techniques to utilize Docker to automate testing your database. You will also learn techniques for deploying database changes to development, QA, and (gasp) production, fully integrating your database into your existing DevOps pipeline. Finally, there will be a review of potential pitfalls and where you may want to fall back to old reliable: the hand-built script.'
