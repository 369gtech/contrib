description: "https://jeeconf.com/program/lets-build-a-java-backend-designed-for-a-high-load/\n\nWe’ll consider a process of building specific Java backend application that must survive a high load.\n\nDuring the talk we’ll analyse requirements, pick up a technical stack and then while discussing specific functionality go through typical major painful points that specifically Java developers are not taking into account that eventually result in inability to run such application at large scale, breach response times, crash via OOM and some others. Following the discussion about potential architectural flaws, we’ll also discuss recommended approaches, techniques and solutions for tackling those."
