description: "Business Agility is the new trend-topic in the Agile community lingo. For the international Agile community, is more than clear that is time to make Agile adoptions to progress and go beyond IT. The new goal is to get organisations as a whole and final customers to feel the benefits of a new business approach.\nNow that we are re-framing Agility, new questions arise: how does business Agility look like? what are the real benefits to the business? why should we care? how to make it happen? can we measure Business Agility? and even more, what’s next?.\nI’ll give my answer to all this questions from a systemic perspective using Integral theory and complexity thinking in the service of a pragmatic approach to business agility.\n\nAbout the speaker:\nAngel is a very energetic Agile coach who truly enjoy challenges. Putting in place Lean and Agile concepts and practices in very complex environments is my specialty and passion.
