description: "Until now using a quantum computer was only possible if you were working in a research lab. Today IBM has opened up access to a quantum computer in the cloud. This makes it possible for anybody to start running his own quantum computing experiments.\nIn this session we explain what is available and we will illustrate this with a number of practical experiments. After an introduction to the IBM quantum experience we look into the composer. The tool which allows you to simulate experiments and then submit them to the quantum computer.\nNext we look into some real quantum experiments. We start by experimenting with the basic building blocks qubits and gates. After which we study some quantum algorithms and see how they work. As a last step we look into the aspects of Quantum Error Correction.\nTo conclude we summarize possible use cases today and explain how you can get started yourself.\n\n Eric Cattoir\nDuring a 20 year career at IBM Eric was involved with many customer projects of various sizes. He has a long experience in all kind of development related technologies, ranging from Mainframe environments till mobile and internet of things. He has been involved in aspects of modernizing existing environments as well as in implementing new technologies. He has experience both with deep down development, but also with methodology, architecture and change consultancy. Currently he is a consultant within the IBM Rational practice, consulting with customers around many application lifecycle management topics (agile, mobile development, devops, implementing cloud platforms, requirements, testing,...) Eric also enjoys coaching at Coderdojo.\n\n[MNZ-0269]"
