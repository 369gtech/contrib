title: 'Lambda Jam 2015 - Michael Drogalis - Beginning Onyx - Functional, Distributed Computation in Clojure'
recordingDate: 1445129655
description: "Does your application need to manipulate more data than a machine can handle? Have you tried Hadoop, Storm, or Spark but felt it didn’t quite fit your problem?\n\nOnyx is a new distributed, masterless, fault tolerant computation platform written specifically with Clojure developers in mind. Onyx gracefully composes many concerns that other frameworks complect: computational structure, data flow, lifecycles, deployment, and more. Its superpower is its ability to create distributed workflows at runtime in an ad-hoc fashion. In effect, Onyx allows you to bridge the gap across programming languages, execution environments, and machines. Nothing is fixed at compile time, offering you near infinite flexibility compared to its competitors.\n\nMichael Drogalis is a software engineer at ViaSat. In late 2013, he began the development of Onyx and has since remained the project lead.\n\nFor more on Lambda Jam, visit http://www.lambdajam.com"
