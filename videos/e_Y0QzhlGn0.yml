description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nCloud Native Rust Workshop: Let's go parallel with Rust - Florian Gilcher & Sabree Blackmon, Ferrous Systems GmbH\n\nIn this session, we are going to build a small Rust server together. We’ll start with a simple server that accepts and delivers data through a simple TCP protocol.\n\nThen, we will start using threads to parallelise the process. After that, we will rewrite the same project in an async fashion.\n\nThis way, you will get a basic feel for Rust and its concurrency features.\nTo follow the session, I recommend that have Rust installed through https://rustup.rs (rustup may also be available in your distributions package manager) and have rust-analyzer set up."
