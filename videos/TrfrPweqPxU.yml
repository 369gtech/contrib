description: "Building a robot and enabling it to sense its environment is a wonderful way to apply your Arduino knowledge to the real world. This webcast introduces Arduino techniques for controlling wheeled robots that can move around and use sensors to see and explore their environment.\n\nThe webcast will cover:\n\n    Why a robot is great choice for your next project\n    Principles of controlling robot speed and direction\n    Introduction to sensors used for robot navigation\n    Techniques for implementing robot behaviour:\n    edge avoidance\n    line following\n    obstacle avoidance.\n\nEven if you are not building a robot, this webcast provides practical information on controlling motors and using sensors with Arduino.\n\nAbout Michael Margolis\n\nMichael Margolis is a technologist in the field of real time computing with expertise in developing and delivering hardware and software for interacting with the environment. He has over 30 years of experience in a wide range of relevant technologies, working with Sony, Microsoft, Lucent/Bell Labs, and most recently as Chief Technical Officer with Avaya.\n\nProduced by: Yasmina Greco"
