description: "Deep Dive: Release SIG - Josh Berkus, Red Hat, Chuck Ha, Heptio, Doug MacEachern, VMware, & Caleb Miles, Google \n\nSupporting all qualified Kubernetes contributors in the Kubernetes release process, while continuing to run the release train, has been a huge effort. Increasing community stewardship of Kubernetes test and release infrastructure has been a journey which two SIG Release contributors from outside of Google, and one from The Collective, will discuss. Join us on an in depth exploration to the tooling and processes of SIG Release.You’ve heard a lot in other sessions and events about how the release cycle is managed, but not much about how the actual releases get built. And, more importantly, what this means for contributors who build Kubernetes tools, plugins, and components. Join members of SIG-Release as we discuss how the build and release actually works, and what things we’d like to change. This deep dive will describe the state of bazel builds, the release repository and the tooling around release as well as the internal-to-google workings. A member of the Kubeadm team will describe what this process means for their builds, and the Google team will explain the internal tooling they have around builds and releases. Finally, the 1.12 branch manager will talk about the Release Team’s efforts to de-Googleify many of the build and release steps. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/GrdX"
