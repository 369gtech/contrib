description: 'Like many other products Showpad started as a proof-of-concept. Carefully launched, gradually exposed to the market, and then the ship started sailing. Staying afloat was a plus, but moving forward at cruising speed is what we really wanted. The path of growing our company to over 100 employees and 900 customers, raising $10m in funding along the way, has been quite a ride so far with huge challenges, but also with priceless rewards.'
