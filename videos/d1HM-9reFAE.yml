description: "I am writing in English and you understand me perfectly well. We share a grammar and, thanks to the internet, an ever-growing vocabulary.\n\nI am writing a new JavaScript program and the computer does not understand the words lodash, jquery or angular. I have to npm install and require these words, and while weâ€™ve grown used to package managers and module systems I began to wonder: Can we do better?\n\nWhat happens when words like lodash and fibonacci had meaning without a single require, git clone or npm install? In turn, what if every program you write instantly has a word for it that everyone can use?\n\nTranscript: http://2014.jsconf.eu/speakers/stephan-seidt-the-meaning-of-words.html\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
