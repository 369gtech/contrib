How we implement our processes and the roles they play can have a dramatic effect on the life of our applications. What impact will the choices we make have? How much state is too much? Can our processes get in over their heads? Hold my state and we'll see!\n\nOBJECTIVES\nExamine the good, bad, and ugly ways processes can behave and look at the tools available to us to better diagnose problems.\n\nAUDIENCE\nAnyone building OTP applications.\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nOTP, \nProcesses, \nElixir\n\nTALK LEVEL: Beginner\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - Johnny Winn\nHost of the Elixir Fountain podcast\n\nThe renaissance man from Jacksonville, Johnny embarked on his computing curiosity during the eighties on a Commodore 64.
