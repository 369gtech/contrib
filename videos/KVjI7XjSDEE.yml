description: "Browsing on a game console is a strikingly different experience to browsing on a desktop or mobile device. Consoles teach us about a whole new level of inputs including voice, gesture and d-pad. They also prepare us for challenges such as designing for screens that could be inches or feet away from the user.\n\n2012 brought us the Wii U, a second screen console with a surprisingly decent browser, and IE9 for the Xbox. 2013 promises a range of new Android consoles, and the PlayStation 4, which features a \"share to the web\" button on its controller.\n\nNow that all modern consoles have a browser, and one in five 16-24 year olds already use one to visit websites, it's a context we need to think more seriously about.\n\nThis session will cover the current state of the console browser market, where it's going in the near future, and how these devices will shape how we design and build websites.\n\nAbout Anna: https://www.maban.co.uk\nAbout Mobilism: https://mobilism.nl\n\nVideography generously sponsored by Mirabeau: https://www.mirabeau.nl"
