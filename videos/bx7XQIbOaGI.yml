title: 'Nick Burch – Taking AI/ML to the next level: Text!'
recordingDate: 1626687038
description: "Classifying images into Cats or Hotdogs may make for great AI demos, but for many of us, it has limited $DAYJOB uses. What if you have loads of documents, or inconsistently-written text, or a mash of information? Fear not - the latest AI / ML techniques for text can help!\n\nWith the help of Apache MXNet, scikit-learn, ElasticSearch and friends, we'll progress from a simple text-based ML system, to an advanced system with full linguistic understanding.  We'll also cover some key concepts around building AI / ML systems, and some of the pitfalls that beginners risk encountering. Full example code provided!\n\nAlong the way, we'll look at why text has historically been hard AI / ML, what the latest techniques are, and then Open Source libraries / frameworks implementing them.\n\nThanks to the magic of cloud-hosted notebooks, you can follow along with the code as we go, and try some live coding if we all dare!\n\nSpeaker:\nNick Burch – https://2021.berlinbuzzwords.de/member/nick-burch\n\nMore: https://2021.berlinbuzzwords.de/session/taking-aiml-next-level-text"
