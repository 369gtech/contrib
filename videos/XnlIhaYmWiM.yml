description: "You might have noticed that the world is suffering a pandemic at the moment, and it might have disrupted your software development plans. At least you’ve got a good excuse, though I’ve heard rumors of managers being sacked for not foreseeing the pandemic and including it in their schedules. I’ve not heard that sacking the managers has either made the pandemic go away, or rescued a software development schedule. I’ll leave that first problem to the epidemiologists and virologists, but when circumstances make a laughingstock of your schedule, what can you do? I can’t tell you how to do the impossible, but I can help you make the best of the situation. To do that, we’ll use that much maligned and oft misused tool, estimation. Come with me and we’ll explore ways to use your estimates to guide your response to unforeseen disruptions–meeting near term needs to the extent possible, and future proofing your longer term plans.\n\nGeorge Dinwiddie helps organizations develop software more effectively.
