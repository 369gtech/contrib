description: "This talk was presented during the React Native EU 2021 - the largest community conference in the world focused exclusively on React Native.\n\nAbstract:\n\"One of the “funnest” tasks for every developer of any sort of application is getting to understand What Went Wrong. Debugging the code, you so certainly thought was running right and understanding why now it isn’t. \n\nThis talk aims to deep dive into React Native’s debugging tools, compare the React Native Debugger, Flutter, Reactotron, and selecting the right tools and strategies to debug the most common type of problems you can get when debugging your mobile application. \"\n\nAbout the speaker:\nMonica is currently working as a Mobile Software Engineer at Equinox Media while also finishing her master's in Software Engineering at the New York Institute of Technology. She has focused a big portion of her Engineering experience on Mobile development, especially React Native applications for companies like MLS and SaygeLink; as well as getting to understand the way things work the way they do from “the bottom - up.”\n\nMonica is a ML enthusiast, a -none of the best you have ever seen- snowboarder and surfer and, a forever learner. \n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/imrestrepo\nGithub: https://github.com/iamrestrepo"
