recordingDate: 1433262265
description: "Docker is an extremely popular and relatively new open source project that is able to create containers from almost any application. A container based on Ubuntu with GlassFish and your favorite application is one of the many possibilities. The biggest advantage is that Docker containers can run almost anywhere: on laptops, servers, and also on the Raspberry Pi. Docker is gaining quite some attention and popularity, and some major cloud platform vendors have already indicated that they want to support it. This presentation explains the advantages of Docker and how it can be used on various devices such as the Raspberry Pi.\n\n\nAuthor:\nJohan Janssen\nJohan is working as a Java lead developer / architect and Java trainer at Info Support.
