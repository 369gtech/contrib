description: "Upcoming DevOps Conference:\nDevOps Fest 2020 - 20-21st of March, Kiev, Ukraine\nDetails and tickets: http://bit.ly/360lOkY\n\nThe talk from DevOps Fest conference in Kyiv, Ukraine.\nPresentation: http://bit.ly/2IIPs6u\nFb: https://www.facebook.com/DevOpsFest/\nWebsite: http://www.devopsfest.com.ua/\n\nTroubleshooting the database-related problems turns out to be not a simple task even if you run your database on-premise. And performance debug can become a nightmare when you run it as a managed service in AWS/GCP/Azure, because you have no access to the underlying OS, and series of DB metrics gathered by your monitoring solution is the only subject you have to explore.\nThe talk will make an overview of a monitoring possibilities available for MySQL/PostgreSQL managed database in case of AWS, GCP, and Azure cloud providers. We will review what monitoring data can be gathered, speak about data granularity, and discuss ways to export these metrics to Prometheus for their simplified representation and wide/complex troubleshooting analysis of the whole instance."
