description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nSponsored Lightning Talk: Protecting All Your Kubernetes Data - Mathew Ericson, Commvault  \n\nKubernetes helps accelerate application modernization. When adopting K8s, you generate a lot of data that must be protected. This includes K8s persistent data, plus data on laptops, source-code control systems, and CI/CD systems. Protecting, recovering, and migrating your data and applications requires agility and deep awareness of your application data across on-prem and cloud locations.  You can take an application-centric approach focused on capturing the entire K8s application (manifests, persistent data, dependent resources) and/or an infrastructure-centric approach focused on leveraging next gen software-defined storage that is integrated into K8s via CSI. Both are valid depending on what you are trying to achieve.  In this session, we’ll cover: o What data to protect in Kubernetes o What data to protect outside Kubernetes (e.g., etcd) o How to adopt a holistic data protection approach \n\nhttps://sched.co/f6kN"
