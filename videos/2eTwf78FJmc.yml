title: 'YOW! Lambda Jam 2020 - Michael Pilquist - Scodec for Scala 3'
language: English
recordingDate: 1609290453
description: "Scodec for Scala 3\nScala 3 introduces new features which help manage complexity. In this talk, we’ll look at porting Scodec from Scala 2 to Scala 3, using new language features to simplify the library.\nYou’ll see the ease of migrating projects to Scala 3 and perhaps be inspired to port some of your own.\nMichael has been using Scala since 2009, when he was convinced to give it a try by listening to Dick Wall and the Java Posse.\nHe introduced Scala at Comcast and has written a number of open source functional programming libraries since then, including scodec, simulacrum, and ip4s. He’s also the lead maintainer of FS2, a pretty neat functional streaming library.\n\nFor more information on YOW! Conference visit, www.yowconference.com.au"
