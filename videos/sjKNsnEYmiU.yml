description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nBridging the Great Divide: SPIFFE/SPIRE for Cross-Cluster Authentication - Andrew Harding, VMware\n\nCross-cluster authentication got you down? Losing your hair trying to get mutually authenticated TLS inside, outside, and everywhere in-between? Fret no more! In this talk, Andrew Harding, a maintainer on the SPIFFE and SPIRE projects, will dig deep into a turnkey SPIRE deployment within Kubernetes that provides workloads and proxies with X.509 certificate-based SPIFFE identities. Andrew will demonstrate how to use these identities for cross-cluster authentication by declaring federation relationships between clusters using familiar Kubernetes primitives. On top of that, a live coding and demo session will show just how easy it is to leverage SPIFFE from within Kubernetes workloads with just a few lines of code."
