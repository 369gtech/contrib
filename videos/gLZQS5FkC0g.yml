description: "Educating the Future\n\nDavid Kinnen - Curriculum Leader KS5 Progress and Achievement\n\nSoftware development is one of the fastest growing industries nationally and regionally - yet businesses are struggling to recruit young people with the required knowledge and skills.\n\nDavid Kinnen, Quality Assurance and Improvement Manager for Thetford Academy Sixth Form, will outline all the developments in secondary and further education around computer science teaching, the ever changing landscape of qualifications offered, what the establishment of the National Centre for Computing Education could mean for industry, and what the new T level qualifications might do to address the skills shortage. Come and hear how schools and colleges could help industry, and what help schools and colleges need from industry to make students “career ready”.\n\n## About nor(DEV):con\n\nThe eastern region's biggest tech conference runs annually in February with a fantastic line-up of speakers and workshops. In our fifth year we joined 41 speakers, over 5 tracks, speaking on a wide range of subjects. Day 1 kicked off with technical deep dives into popular and important languages, frameworks and process. Our key theme for 2020 was wellbeing, with plenty of talks on the main stage around the subject on Day 2, alongside Workshops and plenty of tech talk too.\n\nYou can read more about the line up for 2020 at https://2020.nordevcon.com/ or watch 2021 shape up on our main site https://nordevcon.com/\n\n## About Norfolk Developers\n\nComplementing the existing tech community, Norfolk Developers will be peeling back the high level and going straight to the heart of software development practices and processes.
