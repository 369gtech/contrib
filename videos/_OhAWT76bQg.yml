title: '[JSConfUS 2013] Nathan Totten: Node Copters in the Cloud'
recordingDate: 1381852419
description: 'You have seen how cool it is to wirelessly control flying robots using Node.js, now come see how we can extend the Node Copters with the power of the cloud! Come see how we can use Node.js and Windows Azure to remotely control our robots from hundreds of miles away. See how we can instantly upload our Node Copter camera videos to the cloud and more. This session promises to be ridiculous and fun. Why would we do this you might ask? Because we can.'
