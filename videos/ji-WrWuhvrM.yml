recordingDate: 1518521403
description: "Imagine you've agreed to take on an adjunct professor position to teach 20 college students the basics of web development in 12 weeks. Most of the content will include basic to intermediate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but how do you teach it? How do you keep your students engaged and excited? How do you help them when they're frustrated with a bug? How do you keep them informed on current events surrounding the web?\n\nThis talk will answer these questions and highlight this very experience and detail the challenges, triumphs, and lessons learned from teaching basic web development in an academic setting."
