title: 'A case study in incrementing a language''s major version: PHP'
recordingDate: 1548371293
description: "Adam Harvey\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/149/\n\nIn 2015, the PHP project released version 7.0 of the PHP language. Doing so was\r\nthe culmination of several years of discussion and hard work to resolve what a\r\nnew major version would look like, what would be included, and most\r\nimportantly, what would be broken for existing users.\r\n\r\nIn the end, PHP 7 was released with almost no backward compatibility breaks for\r\nwell written, modern PHP 5 code. As a result, uptake of PHP 7 after two years\r\nhas been — depending on which source you use and how you measure it — between\r\n33% and 67%.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I'll discuss how the PHP team balanced the carrot and the stick\r\nto encourage adoption, and compare how PHP's approach to a major version bump\r\nhas contrasted with other languages in the recent past.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
