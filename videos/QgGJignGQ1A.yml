description: "Visit the largest developers congress in Europe: WeAreDevelopers World Congress, 16 - 18 May 2018 in Vienna, Austria.\n\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/congress/\n\nWe’re all pretty stoked about ES6 / ES2015 and all the features we’ve recently added the language. JavaScript really has taken a step into the modern era and embraced its role as the language being in almost every contexts, from the Internet of Things to the server to your TV. \n\nBeyond what language features did for JavaScript, perhaps its most contribution is it started the yearly release cycle for revisions of JavaScript. With the march of progress ever moving forward it can be overwhelming to keep track of what’s in the pipeline. We’ll go over the process of how a feature makes it into the language and highlight some of my and the JavaScript standardization committee’s favorite features upcoming in JavaScript.\n\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/wearedevelopers.org/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/wearedevs/\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/wearedevelopers.org/"
