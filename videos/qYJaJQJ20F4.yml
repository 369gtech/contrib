description: "Google Tech Talks\r\nAugust 30, 2007\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nA special space station tour for Googlers by NASA astronaut Daniel W. Bursch detailing his more than six months long stay on the International Space Station. In addition of Illustrating the stay with many unpublished pictures of both the station and Earth, Dan will take us through the nooks and crannies of living and working in weightlessness. He will also talk about the psychological challenges of living with two other people in the same \"can\", a theme that will no doubt affect profoundly any human mission to Mars. Carl Walz and Dan Bursch set the US record for the longest single spaceflight in 2002, when they flew for 196 days, this record was just broken this year by US astronaut Michael Lopez-Alegria.\r\n\r\nPresented by: DANIEL W. BURSCH (CAPTAIN, USN, Ret.)\\NASA ASTRONAUT (FORMER)\r\n\r\nNASA EXPERIENCE: Selected by NASA in January 1990, Bursch became an astronaut in July 1991. His technical assignments to date include: Astronaut Office Operations Development Branch, working on controls and displays for the Space Shuttle and Space Station; Chief of Astronaut Appearances; spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM) in mission control. A veteran of four space flights, Bursch has logged over 227 days in space. He was a mission specialist on STS-51 (1993), STS-68 (1994) and STS-77 (1996), and served as flight engineer on the International Space Station (ISS) Expedition-Four (2001-2002). Dan Bursch and fellow astronaut Carl Walz have one of the longest single flights for US astronauts: 196 days in space. In January 2003, Bursch reported to the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, CA for a two year assignment as an instructor in the Space Systems Academic Group. In June 2004 he was appointed Associate Dean of the Graduate School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Bursch retired from the Navy in July 2005 after 26 years of service. He joined the Aerospace Corporation and currently serves as the National Reconnaissance Office Chair at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey.\r\n\r\nEXPERIENCE: Bursch graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1979, and was designated a naval flight officer in April 1980 at Pensacola, Florida. After initial training as an A-6E Intruder bombardier/navigator (B/N), he reported to Attack Squadron 34 in January 1981, and deployed to the Mediterranean aboard the USS John F. Kennedy, and to the North Atlantic and Indian Oceans aboard the USS America. He attended the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School in January 1984. Upon graduation in December he worked as a project test flight officer flying the A-6 Intruder until August 1984, when he returned to the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School as a flight instructor. In April 1987, Bursch was assigned to the Commander, Cruiser-Destroyer Group 1, as Strike Operations Officer, making deployments to the Indian Ocean aboard the USS Long Beach and the USS Midway. Redesignated an Aeronautical Engineering Duty officer (AEDO), he attended the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California, from July 1989 until his selection to the astronaut program.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION: Graduated from Vestal Senior High School, Vestal, New York, in 1975; received a bachelor of science degree in physics from the United States Naval Academy in 1979, and a master of science degree in engineering science from the Naval Postgraduate School in 1991. Distinguished graduate, U.S. Naval Academy and U.S. Naval Test Pilot School.\r\n\r\nPERSONAL DATA: Born July 25, 1957, in Bristol, Pennsylvania, but considers Vestal, New York, to be his hometown.
