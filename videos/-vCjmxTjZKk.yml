title: 'Visma Cloud Delivery Model: Path to Continuous Delivery by Jekaterina Pundani atDevOps Unicorns'
recordingDate: 1571239467
description: "Nowadays it is not enough to be the fastest to deliver a new service. It is important to ensure that new service can grow and react fast on changing needs. The team which is accountable for the service should be able from day one both to develop it and to operate it in the most efficient way. If you developed a service and then struggle to continue developing it because of large technical debt – you might fail. This is what we do believe in Visma.\n\nIn this presentation, Jekaterina will share:\n– how Delivery Teams are built and developed\n– what tools we are using to support service quality and maintainability\n– how the delivery process looks like when service is being published to the Cloud\n– and what kind of challenges the Team faced and resolved by implementing Continuous Delivery Process."
