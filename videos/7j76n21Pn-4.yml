description: "Kubernetes Scalability Definition Evolution - Wojciech Tyczynski & Andrzej Wasylkowski, Google \n\nWhen Kubernetes 1.0 was announced in 2015, Kubernetes was claimed to support 100-node clusters. In order to prove that, we made the first attempt to define what does it mean that “Kubernetes scales to X-node clusters”. The SLOs making that definition were described in more detail in the first scalability-related Kubernetes blog post. However, as Kubernetes was maturing and new features were being added to it, it turned out that the initial definition is becoming meaningless, especially for larger users.  In this presentation, we will explain how the definition was evolving over time and where we are heading, what are our principles driving that evolution and what efforts were spawned as a result of that (such as new SLIs/SLOs effort, testing tooling etc.) \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPck"
