description: "by Matias Martinez\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/H.2213/ml_on_code_coming.webm\n\n\nSoftware repositories such as Git have become a relevant source of information for software engineer researchers.\nFor instance, the detection of commits that fulfill a given criterion (e.g., bugfixing commits) is one of the most frequent tasks done to understand the software evolution.\nHowever, to our knowledge, there is not open-source tools that, given a Git repository, returns all the instances of a given source code change pattern.\nIn this talk, we present Coming, a tool that takes an input a Git repository and mines instances of source code change patterns on each commit.\nFor that, Coming computes fine-grained changes between two consecutive revisions, analyzes those changes to detect if they correspond to an instance of a change pattern (specified by the user using XML).\nFinally, after analyzing all the commits, Coming presents the frequency of code changes and the instances found on each commit. \n\nRoom: H.2213\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 14:30:00+01"
