description: "by Aur√©lien Aptel\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/UD2.119/extend_emacs_2019.webm\n\n\nStarting with GNU Emacs 25, your favorite editor can now load and execute shared objects at runtime. That means you can extend Emacs by writing C code for example. This talk will briefly present the history and controversies about binary modules in the GNU world, cover the basics of the module API and show you how to write a simple module. \n\nRoom: UD2.119\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 15:55:00+01"
