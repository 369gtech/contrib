description: 'Too much to learn in today''s tech world? Feel like there''s no end to what you need to know? Maybe you''ve completed a web development boot camp and think you have a good grasp on the technology. Of course, the moment you google, you realize there is so much more out there and a ton more to learn. When is enough, enough? Sure, learning is a lot of fun and probably why you got into this field, but if you''re looking for a new job, it becomes very intimidating and overwhelming. Well, it turns out that you don''t need to know the latest framework to help your career. To get a good gig, the key is to know what hiring managers *really* want. As a bonus, I''ll talk about what to do once you have the job so that you can move up the food chain to where you actually want to be.'
