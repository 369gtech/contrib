description: "Mark Jamieson, Author & Trainer (in mindfulness)\n\nWhat's it like to be in charge of a project that produces nothing and costs $17 million dollars?  \n\nMost people would keep quiet about it, but Mark Jamieson wrote a book about it instead.  Scarred by the experience, but still alive, it fuelled his desire to find out why smart people do dumb things.  \n\nAuthor of the book \"Calm\" and founder of the Calm Revolution, Mark helps corporates slow down, listen up and operate from that clear, calm space.\n\nEvent Page: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/fuckup-nights-singapore-vol-iv-tickets-17964491277\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/WCgt/"
