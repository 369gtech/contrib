language: English
recordingDate: 1570813031
description: "by Stefano Maestri & Alessio Soldano\n\nJava has a generally bad name when it comes to its usage outside classical enterprise application because of its boot times and memory footprints. Low memory footprint and quick boot time are very important not only to develop modern cloud and serverless application, but also to develop AI/tensorflow powered microservice. The talk will demonstrate how using Quarkus a java enterprise application could include AI models, keeping low boot time and memory footprint being ready for cloud and serverless."
