title: 'Melinda Toth,  Tamás Kozsik - Discovering Parallel Pattern Candidates - Erlang User Conference 2015'
recordingDate: 1438274009
description: "Slides and more info: http://www.erlang-factory.com/euc2015/melinda-toth\n\nThe ParaPhrase Refactoring Tool for Erlang (PaRTE) provides automatic, comprehensive and reliable pattern candidate discovery to locate parallelisable components in Erlang programs. It uses semi-automatic and semantics-preserving program transformations to reshape source code and to introduce high level parallel patterns that can be mapped adaptively to the available hardware resources. This talk introduces the main PaRTE tools and demonstrates the result obtained in d&c pattern discovery.  \n\nDivide-and-conquer algorithms are good candidates for parallelization. Their identifying property is that a d&c routine divides its input into \"smaller\" chunks, calls itself recursively on these smaller chunks, and combines the outputs into one. We set up conditions which characterize a wide range of d&c routine definitions. We want to demonstrate these conditions, and show the matching candidates found in open source Erlang projects.\n\nMelinda Tóth is an assistant lecturer at the Faculty of Informatics, Eötvös Loránd University and a researcher at ELTE-Soft Ltd. Her PhD research focuses on functional languages and static program analysis. She has taken part in four large projects funded by the Hungarian Government and now she is a researcher in the ParaPhrase Enlarged project. She is the leader of the RefactorErl group and the ELTE-Ericsson Software Technology Lab."
