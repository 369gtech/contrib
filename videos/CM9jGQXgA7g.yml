language: English
recordingDate: 1433517359
description: "Misnomers abound as to what constitutes a working role-based access control (RBAC) system. With ANSI RBAC, groups are not roles and resource connections are not sessions. This presentation explains what ANSI RBAC is and how it can be applied to existing Java EE systems using Java EE and Spring security. It dispels longstanding myths persistent within the enterprise. Additionally you’ll receive tips on how to implement your own successful RBAC program by using well-established best practices. The session also introduces you to a fully compliant Java EE ANSI RBAC system that is open-source and ready to be used today.\n\n\nAuthors:\nShawn McKinney\nSoftware manager, consultant, and architect with twenty years experience leading technology teams in security, packaging and other infrastructure concerns.
