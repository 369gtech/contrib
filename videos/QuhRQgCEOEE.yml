description: "Speaker: Hazrul Azhar Jamari\n\nHazrul was the creator behind rezkii.com, a defunct woocommerce-as-a-service product. He feels WooCommerce is really painful for regular people to start a store and hosted platforms like Shopify are taking a lot from Woo’s pie. But have the industry caught up?\n\nThis presentation is a comparison of Managed WooCommerce Hosting (Pantheon, Nestify) and WooCommerce-as-a-service solutions (Woocart). It describes similarities and differences, and what it means to the non-techies who wish to use WooCommerce as their tech stack for their e-Commerce business.\n\nAnd he will also make a comparison between Woocart vs Shopify vs Ecwid and discuss the similarities and differences of each platform.\n\nIs Woocart the answer? Will Woocommerce ever go towards Woo-as-a-service? Perhaps there’ll be more questions than answers. Find out in this talk.\n\nAbout the speaker\n\nI’m a family man, entrepreneur, software engineer, and foodie, and have been building startups all my life. I have gone through a complete cycle of E-Commerce from training, building online and mobile e-store, building payment gateways and building a fulflllment and distribution system throughout my career.\n\nEvent Page: https://2019.singapore.wordcamp.org/sessions/#wcorg-session-1138\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/BEH5R/"
