title: 'MR Security: Learning from IoT''s Mistakes'
recordingDate: 1548379023
description: "Diane Hosfelt\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/123/\n\nVirtual and augmented reality technologies are becoming mainstream, and their privacy implications are staggering. As a security engineer with the Mixed Reality (MR) team at Mozilla Research, part of my job is to explore what privacy and security will mean in an immersive world.\r\n\r\nVR and AR create a world that blurs the lines between technology and reality, with all of the security challenges that this entails. Intensely personal traits like a userâ€™s gait and eye-tracking (just two of many examples) can and sometimes must be exposed for immersive experiences to work correctly. VR also introduces questions about personal (virtual) space and location data ownership (can I pop into your kitchen and hang out in AR? or leave some virtual ðŸ’© on your doorstep?). Itâ€™s our job as technologists to figure out how to build systems robust against abuse.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy looking back to what we got right and what we could have done better the last time we invited new technologies into our homes and lives, as well as discussing the new technological and legal challenges unique to VR, this talk will explore our current opportunities to get VR less wrong than we got IoT.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
