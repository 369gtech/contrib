description: "Why is it so difficult to get a solid grasp on accessibility?\n\nWe have guidelines, we should know how to make software accessible! Well, the technical side is not the hard part, the hard part is making people aware of the special perspective of the users.\n\nThat is why we started an experiment and put our developers in a blind user's shoes. Simple, but the effect is astonishing!\n\nPeter Aichinger:\nDeveloper at TOPdesk in Kaiserslautern, Germany. Feeling at home in the java world, but also trying to keep up to date in the wild west of frontend development.\n\nAnna Maier:\nAnna Maier is a software developer at TOPdesk with a passion for good structured code, pragmatic solutions and learning."
