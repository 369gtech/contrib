description: "Excellent real-world JavaScript performance for the web — both in the browser and server-side with Node.js — has never been more important. Over the last few years, the V8 team has learned that optimizing for the real world is different than optimizing for synthetic benchmarks. The key lesson? Consistent, good baseline performance across the entire JavaScript language is the central ingredient to a fast web. In this talk, we’ll discuss how V8’s new compilation pipeline using Ignition and TurboFan enables good baseline performance, and better yet, we’ll demonstrate how using the full expressiveness of the JavaScript language in your applications can lead to faster code.\n\nEVENT:\n\n.concat() 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nDaniel Clifford\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M5VK-RfP0E&t=204s"
