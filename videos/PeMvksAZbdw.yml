description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Chicago 2020. #GOTOcon #GOTOchgo\nhttp://gotochgo.com\n\nOleg Šelajev - Developer Advocate at Oracle\n\nABSTRACT\nGraalVM is a high-performance virtual machine offering new optimizations for individual languages and seamless interoperability for polyglot applications. For Java, GraalVM lets you optimize different performance aspects including a choice between JIT and AOT compilation modes, employing diagnostics tools and selecting the best language libraries for the job.\nIn this session, we'll go through optimization strategies for the most common cases, discuss their benefits and trade-offs, and see what the latest project updates, such as Java 11 support, offer for speeding up your applications. We'll also take a look at how to make real-world applications GraalVM-ready and at the ecosystem of frameworks and libraries that [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n01:00 What is GraalVM?\n03:40 Getting started with GraalVM\n04:36 GraalVM JIT performance\n06:53 Demo\n10:47 AOT vs. JIT\n13:21 Demo\n17:27 AOT vs. JIT continued\n17:57 GraalVM ecosystem\n\nRead the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotochgo.com/2020/sessions/1290/maximizing-java-application-performance-with-graalvm\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#GraalVM #Java #VirtualMachine #JIT #AOT #Java11 #Programming #Backend\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
