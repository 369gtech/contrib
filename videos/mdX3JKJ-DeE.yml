description: "This talk will start with a brief overview of Spring for Apache Kafka and then we’ll introduce the new features in the recently released 2.7 version, including a large community contribution. It will be mainly a live coding demonstration, with time for Q&A.\n\nGary Russell has been in software engineering, concentrating on Enterprise Integration, for nearly 40 years on various platforms, and in the Java space since the late ’90s. He has been developing with the Spring Framework since 2004. He has been a committer on the Spring Integration and Spring AMQP projects for over 10 years; he started the Spring for Apache Kafka project in 2016. He leads both Spring AMQP and Spring for Apache Kafka and is a former lead of Spring Integration.\n\ntanzu.tv/tt/53"
