title: 'DEF CON 26 CAR HACKING VILLAGE - Ben - Misbehavior Detection in V2X Networks'
language: English
recordingDate: 1541026580
description: 'There exist several approaches to misbehavior detection in V2X networks in research literature, many of them not necessarily taking automotive restrictions into account. Only few approaches do and there is only one approach that has been tested in actual vehicles as far as I know. And that approach has it challenges - although it is an important first step towards implementation. I will present how this (and one or two other) approach works and how it can be tricked. Although misbehavior detection is an integral part of the V2X security system nobody seems to care that V2X gets deployed, but there is no feasible approach for misbehavior detection. I will present a hypothesis why this is and will discuss it with the audience.'
