description: "This talk will introduce you in disadvantages of locking and show you a possible alternative. We will talk about CAS operations and Java Atomic classes. This talk will be interesting: \n1. for programmers who have heard about CAS and lock-free, but who have no experience in writing non-blocking code — I'll give a short introduction. \n2. for experienced multi-threaded programmers — we will talk about CAS/atomics implementation details! \n3. for hipsters (special offer!): we will cover \"\"immutable vs. mutable\"\" internet hype!"
