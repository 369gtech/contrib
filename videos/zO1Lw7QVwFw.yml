Asia in Singapore. But, how to fight in this battle? A common approach has been to keep “under control” some well-known network quality indicators, like dropped calls, radio access congestion, availability, and so on; but this has proven not to be enough to keep customers happy, like a siege weapon is not enough to conquer a city. But, what if it were possible to know how customers perceive services, at least most demanded ones, like web browsing or video streaming? That would be like a squad of archers ready to battle. And even having that, how to extract value of it and take actions in no time, giving our skilled archers the right targets? Meet CANVAS (Customer And Network Visualization and AnaltyticS), one of the first LATAM implementations of a Flink-based stream processing use case for a telco, which successfully combines leading and innovative technologies like Apache Hadoop, YARN, Kafka, Nifi, Druid and advanced visualizations with Flink core features like non-trivial stateful stream processing (joins, windows and aggregations on event time) and CEP capabilities for alarm generation, delivering a next-generation tool for SOC (Service Operation Center) teams.\n\nhttps://data-artisans.com/"
