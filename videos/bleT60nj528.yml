language: English
recordingDate: 1610456408
description: "Testing your C# skills as a software developer is an essential part of understanding what you really know. Just watching a tutorial can give you a false sense of security. It isn't until you actually implement what you were learning that you know how much you really grasped. \n\nWaiting to do this until an interview or at your job is a recipe for disaster. Unfortunately, testing your knowledge is something people often struggle to do well.\n\nThat is why I created the Prove It course series.\n\nCourse List: https://www.iamtimcorey.com/courses\nProve It C# Bundle: https://www.iamtimcorey.com/p/prove-it-c-bundle\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/IAmTimCorey\nMailing List:  https://signup.iamtimcorey.com/"
