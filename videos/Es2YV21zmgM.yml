title: 'O''Reilly Webcast: The Linux Way: Rebuilding The Unix Way for a New Era'
recordingDate: 1378399570
description: "The original UNIX philosophy could be summed up: \"Write programs that do one thing and do it well. Write programs to work together. Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.\"\n\nLinux, as a \"UNIX clone\", supports a command line environment that a 1970s-era Unix hacker would find familiar — sed, awk, ps, and the rest are all there. But Linux has not stood still since catching up with proprietary UNIX. Using Linux for new jobs on new categories of computers has led us to extend the platform to suit our needs.\n\nThis webcast talk presented by Andy Grover will cover some of the ways the Linux platform has moved away from the Unix philosophy, while still holding true to some fundamental values, and how we users and hackers are defining a new Linux Way, distinct from the Unix Way.\n\nAbout Andy Grover\n\nAndy Grover is a Principal Software Engineer at Red Hat, working to improve Linux's block storage capabilities. His work encompasses both changes to the kernel itself as well as low-level management tools. Previous work areas include networking and ACPI. He lives in Portland.\n\nOSCON\n\nProduced by: Yasmina Greco"
