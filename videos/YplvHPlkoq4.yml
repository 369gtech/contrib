title: 'Lucian Precup – Beyond Artificial Intelligence for Search'
recordingDate: 1628668028
description: "It is proven that for relatively well-structured data, like in e-commerce for example, a hand tailored search configuration can easily outperform machine learning approaches for relevance. The search configuration considers the different searchable fields, a business taxonomy and ontology, some domain related synonyms, a few specific landing pages, boosts and some business numerical criteria.\n\nIn the same way, we describe an approach for relevance in the case of large-scale search engines which is not based on classical \"PageRank\" and machine learning approaches. We propose a model based on social interactions between communities and individuals that are using or configuring the search engine. We then compare this model with machine learning powered approaches.\n\nSpeaker:\nLucian Precup – https://2021.berlinbuzzwords.de/member/lucian-precup\n\nMore: https://2021.berlinbuzzwords.de/session/beyond-artificial-intelligence-search"
