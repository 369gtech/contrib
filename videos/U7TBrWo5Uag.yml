description: "Ближайшая конференция — DotNext 2020 Moscow\n2-5 декабря, Online\nПодробности и билеты: https://dotnext-moscow.ru/\n\n. Не MSBuild'ом единым. Если хочется писать билд-скрипты на C#, то вам сюда.\n\nFounded in April 2017, NUKE is a free, open source build automation system for C#/.NET that runs cross-platform on .NET Core, .NET Framework, and Mono. While builds are bootstrapped with conventional Bash or PowerShell scripts, their actual implementation resides in simple C# console applications. This approach unleashes the power of the type system and natively provides IDE features like code completion, refactorings, and debugging. A custom global tool and several IDE extensions further improve how build projects are set up, authored and executed. The presentation will also focus on more recent additions to the framework, like advanced execution plans, enhanced IDE integration, flexible parameter resolution, and available build sharing options.\n\nCome to this talk if you want to learn how to write maintainable and reliable builds with NUKE, which are also understood by everyone in your team!"
