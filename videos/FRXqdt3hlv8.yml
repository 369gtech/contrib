description: "Change or die. Survival is not mandatory. The practices of DevOps, SRE, agile, and friends are long proven and have been science-ed to indisputable Truth in the past decade. But changing how people work is still the most persistent problem for organizations that want to improve their software process. This talk sides with the change-resisters to understand and empathize with why they’re so resistant. It then offers tactics to motivate people to change rather than willfully pouring more concrete on their pillow-fort of bureaucracy.\n\nMichael Coté, Developer Advocate at VMware\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/we-fear-change-250367555"
