title: 'OSCON Data 2011:  Dwight Merriman, "Databases for Agile Development"'
recordingDate: 1311720204
description: "Much has been made of scalability as a driver for choosing a database, but the choice of a database influences much more than the scaling architecture. Different database choices drive different data models which in turn influence the development process. Dwight Merriman, founder and CEO of 10gen and a core MongoDB committer, will draw on his experiences from DoubleClick, where he was founder and CTO, as well as his experiences founding Gilt Groupe, ShopWiki, and Business Insider, to discuss how the influence of the database on the development process and how making the right database choices can allow agile development.\n\nDwight Merriman\n\n10gen\n\nDwight is CEO of 10gen which sponsors the open source MongoDB project. Dwight is an active MongoDB committer.\n\nDwight was cofounder of DoubleClick and CTO of DoubleClick for 10 years. Dwight is the original architect of the DoubleClick DART ad serving system."
