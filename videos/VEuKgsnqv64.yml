See http://fitc.ca for details.\n\nOverview\nMany companies maintain a separate repo for web and native mobile applications, and sometimes yet another for mobile web. Historically you may hear that ‘wrapped applications’ are slower and choppy. This is no longer the case – if your application is structured correctly.\n\nBy using Ember.js with Cordova, it is possible to have a single code base powering all four (desktop web, mobile web, native iOS and native Android). Outside of the immediate cost/programming time savings, this technique enables you to build future iterations faster and stop the out of sync issues plaguing many code bases (e.g. the Android app has different features to iOS).\n\nAlexander Blom\nPartner, Isle of Code\nhttps://twitter.com/alexblom\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/alexblom\nhttps://github.com/AlexBlom/\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
