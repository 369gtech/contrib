title: 'Plugging Users In: Extend Your Application with Pluggable Groovy DSL'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433260848
description: "It is often beneficial to enable users to extend your software with their own logic, and with dynamic languages on the JVM, it is also easy to do so. This session shares JFrogâ€™s experience in creating a public, Groovy-authored user plug-in interface. It explains what domain-specific languages (DSLs) are, what their relevance to user plug-ins is, and how they can be implemented in Groovy or Java. It also discusses another very important aspect of pluggability: good public API design. Further, it covers security concerns and how they should be tackled. And finally, it discusses classpath isolation issues you may run into and compares different solutions to this problem.\n\n\nAuthors:\nBaruch Sadogursky\nBaruch Sadogursky (a.k.a JBaruch) is the Developer Advocate of JFrog, the creators of Artifactory Binary Repository, the home of Bintray, and JavaOne 2011 Duke Choice Awards winner.
