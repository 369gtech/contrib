title: 'coreboot (aka LinuxBIOS): The Free/Open-Source x86 Firmware'
recordingDate: 1225478853
description: "Google Tech Talks\nOctober 30, 2008\n\nABSTRACT\n\nCoreboot, formerly known as LinuxBIOS, was originally started in 1999 to complement LOBOS [2] (Linux OS Boots OS) as part of an effort to move away from inscrutible and inflexible proprietary BIOS firmware used in clusters at high-security government research labs. However, coreboot took on a life of its own and quickly overcame many obstacles thanks to the help of a friendly and knowledgable open source community. This talk will give an overview of coreboot, what it is capable of, what it is incapable of, and what makes it different from the traditional PC BIOS and EFI. We'll focus on developments in version 3 which cleans up the development model substantially, has much improved ACPI and SMI support, usage of the Linux kernel build system to build coreboot, new ways to boot locally and over a network, do some demos, and more!\n\nSpeaker: Ronald G. Minnich\nRon Minnich founded the LinuxBIOS project (which is now Coreboot) when he joined the Cluster Research Team at Los Alamos Nat'l Lab in 1999. He has been working in HPC for much longer than he ever expected to, which explains the grey hairs in his beard. He has built software and HPC systems based on FPGAs, PIMs, distributed computers (co-authoring a famous C song: \"I was Grid before Grid was cool\"), and clusters. He has been working with Unix innards longer than some of his co-workers have been alive, which fact causes him to wonder if he should get in another line of work.\n\nRon is also a contributor to Linux (v9fs), Plan 9, has written articles for numerous publications (DDJ, Linux Journal, etc) and has authored and co-authored over 20 papers [4] covering everything from distributed computing, shared memory models, firmware (Coreboot), large-scale fault tolerant computing, and much more.\n\n[4] portal.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100104582=15151515=6184618\n\nSpeaker: Stefan Reinauer\nStefan Reinauer was a very early contributor to the project during his time as system architect as SuSE and was also the lead developer of OpenBIOS, the free/open-source Open Firmware implementation. \n\nStefan eventually founded Coresystems GmbH which focused on providing firmware solutions centered around Open Firmware and Coreboot and has since assumed stewardship of the project."
