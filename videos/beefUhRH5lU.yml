title: 'SREcon19 Asia/Pacific - Linux Memory Management at Scale: Under the Hood'
language: English
recordingDate: 1563562530
description: "Chris Down, Facebook\n\nMemory management is an extraordinarily complex and widely misunderstood topic. It is also one of the most fundamental concepts to understand in order to produce coherent, stable, and performant systems, especially at scale.\n\nIn this talk, we will go over how to build compose reliable memory-heavy systems. We will go over fundamental concepts of Linux memory management which are important for site reliability with a SRE who works on the Linux memory subsystem, busting commonly held misconceptions about things like swap, and giving advice on key and bleeding-edge kernel concepts like PSI, cgroup v2, memory protection, and other important topics along the way.\n\nView the full SREcon19 Asia/Pacific program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon19asia/program\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
