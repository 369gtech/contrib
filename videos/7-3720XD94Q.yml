title: 'Dekompiling by Márton Braun, Skyscanner EN'

description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2020 by Márton Braun, Skyscanner.\n\nMore info: https://android-makers-2020.firebaseapp.com/schedule/?sessionId=173703\n\nKotlin has many features that are leaps and bounds ahead of Java. However, its primary target platform being the JVM, all of these features still need to compile to the same bytecode as Java does.\n\nThis is a look at how a variety of interesting Kotlin features are compiled to bytecode, and what their Java equivalents would be. Even though Kotlin abstracts away much of the virtual machine and the original feature set of Java with its own features, it’s still important to know what your Kotlin code compiles to. Not only can this knowledge give you the power to optimize your code, but it will also help you avoid subtle bugs that would otherwise be near impossible to track down."
