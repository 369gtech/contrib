description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nLow-Latency and Session-Oriented Serverless Workflows - Manuel Stein & Paarijaat Aditya, Nokia Bell Labs \n\nCreating latency sensitive applications with serverless computing is challenging. High function invocation overhead and slow access to application state are typically the two main hurdles. In this presentation, we explore alternate design points for FaaS platforms that reduce invocation overhead by co-locating multiple functions of a workflow inside a single container and isolating concurrent function invocations at the process-level. In addition, we examine the use of persistent, addressable functions to maintain application state across function invocations where needed. \n\nhttps://sched.co/aYq6"
