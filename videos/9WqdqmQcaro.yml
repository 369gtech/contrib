title: 'Implementing Distributed Tracing ‘Like a Boss’ in your Kafka Deployments (Ricardo Ferreira, USA)'
recordingDate: 1557862586
description: "https://jeeconf.com/program/implementing-distributed-tracing-like-a-boss-in-your-apache-kafka-deployments/\n\nMicroservices is rapidly becoming the de-facto standard way to develop applications, by breaking down the domain problem into multiple reusable, highly scalable and efficient services. However, when it comes to monitoring these services, developers often have to leverage distributed tracing technologies such as OpenTracing to make the transaction flow observable. Though this is relatively easy to accomplish while dealing with request-response microservices, it might not be that easy bringing distributed tracing to event-driven/asynchronous architectures built on Apache Kafka.\n\nThis talk will explain how distributed tracing can be implemented in pipelines built with Apache Kafka, via the usage of OpenTracing and the Kafka Interceptors API for Java."
