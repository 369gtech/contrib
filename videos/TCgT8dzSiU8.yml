description: "Trusted Web Activities provide a new way to integrate parts of your web experience, in your android app. They’re powered by Custom Tabs, which means the content is rendered user the user’s up-to-date browser instead of an out-of-date webview, it shares cookies and storage within the browser and it has access to APIs that aren’t available in WebViews.\n\nCheck out https://g.co/TrustedWebActivities for all of the details including links to docs, specs and samples.\n\nWatch Pete's talk at I/O on PWAs for Desktop here → https://goo.gl/8rFqLm\nSubscribe to the Chrome Developers channel → http://bit.ly/ChromeDevs1"
