description: "Our main revenue driver as a bank is within our home lending service offering. This is an area fiercely contested by all the banks. Customer expectations, relationships, service levels & speed of change are vital to meeting customer needs. Today, a bank that just offers a better rate to gain more customers is not good enough. The service offering has to be consistent, supportive and effective. In this talk we explore how we drastically improved our home lending service offering, increased team work, gained deeper relationships and trust by using agile teams and all without even one mention of the word ‘agile’.\n\nWe used operational data (volumes/time/decisions) mixed with customer feedback to learn and continuously improvement until we reached version 1 of what an amazing customer experience looks like. We did all of this without any technology or major process change, we more changed the mindset and culture to better meet our customer’s needs.\n\nThe median results over a 13 week period were as follows:\n\n* Increased the number of deal to decision within 5 days by 22%\n* Decreased the time to decision per application by 50 mins (per app)\n* Decreased the days to decision for the 80th percentile by 5 days\n* Delivered 15% of the departments volume with less than 5% of the workforce\n* Quality results were ‘perfect’ they achieved 100% quality from the sample size tested\n\nWe received feedback like: “Basically it was an unbelievable experience for not only myself but for my client who was shocked to get the call to say we are signing up his mortgages on the same day it was lodged”\n\nRichard McAllister is a transformational leader highly focused on results, people, timing, team work, agility and efficiencies and has a wealth of experience within project delivery and organisational culture change.\n\nRichard is currently the head of digital process management. His work requires high energy levels, trust and courage as Bankwest look towards the next step change in their journey.\n\nAside from delivering value for Bankwest, Richard is also the main organiser of one of the largest agile meetups in the country - Agile Perth Meetup (with over 1,400 members). He is also the founder of the not-for-profit - Flow Perth (www.flowperth.org), creating a place where skilled volunteers regularly have events to give back to the community.\n\nFor more on YOW!
