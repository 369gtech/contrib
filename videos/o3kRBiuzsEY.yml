description: "Proposal P1717 offers superpowers unparalleled to what we had before, even comparing to the most elaborate template metaprogramming techniques.\n\nWe'll have a glimpse of that and learn how to harness that power by example implementation of serialization.\n\nWe'll see what upcoming reflection has to offer, and how metaprogramming in C++ will dramatically change in the future.\n\n-------\nGot an engineering degree in missilery from BMSTU (Moscow).\n\nLoves C++ and knows how to cook it.\n\nLikes metaprogramming, multithreading and asynchronous programming, coroutine adoption enthusiast.\n-------\nC++ on Sea is an annual c++ and coding conference, usually held in Folkestone, Kent in the UK. The 2020 conference was moved to a virtual event due to social distancing requirements.\n\nProduced and Edited by Digital Medium Ltd: https://events.digital-medium.co.uk\nEnquiries: events@digital-medium.co.uk"
