description: "The Java EE 7 platform has four new components (WebSocket, JSON-P, batch, and concurrency), three that are significantly updated (JAX-RS, JMS, and EL), and several others that bring significant changes to the platform. As you can imagine, a lot of new functionality has been introduced in the platform. In this fast-paced session, you will learn about 50 new features introduced in the Java EE 7 platform. @ClientEndpoint, chunk-style batch processing, @FlowScoped, @AroundConstruct, @JMSDestinationDefinition, and @Transactional are some of features the presentation covers. It explains each feature with a code snippet and provides details on where and how you can use it in your applications.\n\n\nAuthors:\nAntonio Goncalves\nArchitecte senior, Antonio Goncalves intervient chez ses clients comme consultant et formateur.
