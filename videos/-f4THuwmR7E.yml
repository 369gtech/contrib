title: 'Are you botching the security of your AngularJS application? by Philippe De Ryck'

description: "If you make a list of popular JavaScript MVC frameworks, AngularJS is probably at the top of the list. Developers around the world are crazy about the Angular way of doing things, and love how easy it is to write AngularJS applications. However, few people know that AngularJS packs a lot security features, right out of the box. Unfortunately, because many developers are not aware of these security features, they are often unintentionally circumvented, or not used to their full potential. For example, think about common advice on Stack Overflow to turn off the protection against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, just so you can directly bind HTML data to a variable.\n\nIn this session, you will learn how to leverage AngularJS' security features to their full potential. Specifically, you will learn how AngularJS applies Strict Contextual Escaping (SCE) against XSS attacks, and how to relax that protection in a safe way (instead of turning it off). We also cover the advanced Content Security Policy (CSP), and AngularJS' built-in cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection mechanism. We mainly focus on AngularJS 1.x, but also relate the concepts to AngularJS 2 where relevant.\n\nPhilippe De Ryck is a professional speaker and trainer on software security and web security. Since he obtained his PhD at the imec-DistriNet research group (KU Leuven, Belgium), he has been running the group's Web Security Training program, which ensures a sustainable knowledge transfer of the groupâ€™s security expertise towards practitioners.\n\n[FYR-1485]"
