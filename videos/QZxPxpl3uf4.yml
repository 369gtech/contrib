description: "Nowadays big data seems to be everywhere; monstrous amounts of data to be piped through systems; to be digested by services; to be fed back into the circulation; for you to finally consume an individual view of the world. In times of cloud computing, putting your big data ideas into reality is no rocket science any more; even for small development teams with no data centre at hands.\n\nIn this session I will introduce you a promising approach on how to cope with big data projects the lean way:\n\nManaging big data in the cloud bears a highly dynamic runtime behaviour; especially when costs matter. How to scale up and scale down your cloud resource consumption? Which technology stack works promisingly well? Which patterns and architectures are suitable? How to populate and organize your systems in this dynamic environment without loosing track? How to retain a clear view of your services' and systems' health condition?\n\nBy dissecting a case study in this session I'll introduce you a promising approach on how to tackle those challenges using the Java ecosystem, Amazon AWS cloud services and NoSQL databases; in an agile working environment; breaking down your architecture into subtle bits and pieces to just put them back together again.\nBullet point 1: Cloud Computing\nBullet point 2: Big Data\nBullet point 3: NoSQL"
