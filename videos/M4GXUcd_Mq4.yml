description: "Originally published: June 14, 2004\n\nAnders Hejlsberg is a distinguished engineer here. At least that's his official title. But that doesn't do justice to the role he's played in the industry (first at Borland, where he ran the team that developed Turbo Pascal and later Delphi, or here at Microsoft, where he and his team developed C#).\n\nBut, don't take our word for it -- listen in as he takes you (and interviewer Charles Torre) on a tour of part of Microsoft's Museum and the part he played in computer industry history.\n\nOriginal Channel 9 Post: https://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/TheChannel9Team/Anders-Hejlsberg-Tour-through-computing-industry-history-at-the-Microsoft-Museum"
