description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Chicago 2019. #GOTOcon #GOTOchgo\r\nhttp://gotochgo.com\r\n\r\nJessica Pointing - Award-winning Quantum Computing Researcher\n\r\nORIGINAL TALK TITLE\r\nQuantum Computing - (Almost) Everything You Need To Know About It\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\nCertain types of problems can take billions of years to solve on our current conventional computers. Quantum computers, however, can solve these types of problems in just seconds. Because of their ‘quantum power’, quantum computers have the potential to impact many fields, such as machine learning, medicine, and energy systems.\n• So how do quantum computers actually work?\n• How do we build quantum computers?\n• What are the other potential applications of quantum computing?\n• How much progress have we made?\n• What works already?\n• What does not?\nJessica Pointing will unpack the topic of quantum computing with a fascinating [...]\r\n\r\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\r\nhttps://gotochgo.com/2019/sessions/737/quantum-computing-almost-everything-you-need-to-know-about-it\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOchgo\r\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\r\n#QuantumComputing #QuantumComputers #QuantumPhysics \r\n\r\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\r\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
