language: English
recordingDate: 1491997330
description: "Join us for #RenderConf 2018: https://goo.gl/iXs1mJ\n\nAs an ex-Aerospace Engineer who only could barely code in Matlab for doing data visualisation on aerodynamic flows, I will talk about the thrust that has taken me all the way through to become a passionate Front-end engineer doing mostly data visualisation in an artificial intelligence startup and how I benefited from the community to take off in a field which female is still the minority. Also, I will talk about how I combined my previous expertise into creating applications in React, Redux, d3.js with graph database engineering, the lovely canvas etc.\n\nABOUT FRANCES NG\n\nFrances Ng is a front-end engineer at Cogent Labs Inc, an artificial intelligence startup in Tokyo. She was an aerospace engineer before diving into web development and appreciation of data visualisation. Outside of the terminal, she is a competent badminton player and loves to play all racket sports."
