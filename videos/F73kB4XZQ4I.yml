description: "Efficiency is achieved not just by running things faster, but by avoiding things that shouldn't be done in the first place. Lazy evaluations are a core feature of many functional programming languages. Your code can benefit from lazy evaluations with lambda expressions and, more so, with the power of Streams. In this presentation, we'll start with a discussion of lazy evaluations, with short examples from Haskell and Scala. Then we'll dive into Java to see how we can achieve similar benefits using lambdas and the Stream API.\n\nDr. Venkat Subramaniam is an award-winning author, founder of Agile Developer, Inc., creator of agilelearner.com, and an instructional professor at the University of Houston. He has trained and mentored thousands of software developers in the US, Canada, Europe, and Asia, and is a regularly-invited speaker at several international conferences. Venkat helps his clients effectively apply and succeed with sustainable agile practices on their software projects.\n\nVenkat is a (co)author of multiple technical books, including the 2007 Jolt Productivity award winning book Practices of an Agile Developer.
