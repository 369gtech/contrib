description: "One of the latest hyped buzzwords is “serverless” computing. Does it really mean no servers? Join us for a fun and light-hearted look at what serverless means and how it lets you deploy small bits of code (just functions even, not necessarily full apps) and let the provisioning and scaling be handled in the cloud by someone else!\n\nIn this session, we’ll have a look at Google Cloud Functions, how a veteran Java developer copes with JavaScript and Node.js, and how to be productive developing new functions, through some fun demos.\n\n# Guillaume Laforge\nGuillaume Laforge is Developer Advocate at Google, in the Google Cloud Platform team. He's well-known for his decade-long work on the Apache Groovy programming language project, for which he serves as Chair of the Project Management Committee at the Apache Software Foundation. Guillaume is also a co-founder of the French tech podcast \"Les Cast Codeurs\".\n\n# Bret McGowen\nBret is on the Google Cloud Platform team at Google, focusing on developer-oriented products like App Engine, Compute Engine, the Cloud Vision API, Firebase and more. He's currently an aspiring Node.js developer. Prior to Google, Bret came from Texas, having worked in the cloud industry at Rackspace as a software engineer building the RackConnect hybrid hosting product. Before that, he led engineering teams at e-commerce, non-profit and startup companies. He's often on the running trail, volleyball court or kickball field.\n\nBret earned a bachelor’s degree in computer science from Texas A&M University."
