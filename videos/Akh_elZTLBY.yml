description: "What could put your project at risk of failing? Do you (or other stakeholders) have assumptions that are wrong but go unchallenged until the actual project delivery? Validating your assumptions early ensures you’re designing and building the right thing. What’s an easy way to do this? Think back to high school science class–you can create a hypothesis, test it, and learn from it!\n\nHypothesis driven design has its roots in the scientific method, but is being used more frequently in design practice, playing a key role in methods such as Lean UX. This talk will go over how to get started with design hypotheses, and its benefits.\n\nLeslie Predy\nSr. User Experience Designer, Autodesk\nhttps://twitter.com/lpredster\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc\n\nSave 10% off any FITC event with discount code 'youtube'.\nSee our upcoming events at www.fitc.ca"
