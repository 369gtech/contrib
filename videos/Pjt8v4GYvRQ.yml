description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nFluid - Build Data Orchestration in Kubernetes - Yang Che, Alibaba & Yuandong Xie, Tencent\n\nIn the cloud-native field, data-intensive tasks such as big data and AI will face many problems in the context of the separation of storage and computing architecture. For example, network IO bottlenecks lead to reduced computing efficiency, and the underlying storage system is under huge overhead pressure. On the other hand, the management of multi-source data is very complicated, which is a challenge for algorithm scientists. In this talk, we introduce an efficient and convenient data abstraction, which abstracts data from storage, provides data affinity scheduling, distributed cache engine acceleration, and multi-source data integration data lake through Fluid. In Alibaba Cloud and Tencent Cloud, a large number of Big data and AI workloads are accelerated through Fluid’s data scheduling."
