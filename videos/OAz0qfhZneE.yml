description: "React has exploded in popularity. But it’s only a UI library, not a full-fledged framework like Angular, Ember or [insert latest JS framework]. We need to create our own “framework” by picking from the plethora of libraries in the React solar system. But which ones should we choose? Or better yet, which ones do we actually need? Do we need a Flux implementation? What about handling ES6+, bundling and routing? How does it all come together?!1?!\nLet’s walk through the tools and helper libraries that surround React. You’ll get the most out of the session with familiarity with React and its concepts, but you don’t need to be an expert. By the end of the session, you’ll have a solid understanding of the ecosystem, know which libraries you should prioritize learning first, and confidently build your own React-based stack.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcsydney.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
