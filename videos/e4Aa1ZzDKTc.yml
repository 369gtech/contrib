language: English
recordingDate: 1604581208
description: "Employers often ask for a computer science degree. So how do you succeed in the industry without one? Do you need a specific degree to be a C# developer? What degree do I need as a C# developer? In this episode of Dev Questions, we will be diving into what benefits a degree offers as well as if you even need a degree to succeed.\n\nPodcast: https://iamtimcorey.com/p/podcast\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/IAmTimCorey\nMailing List:  https://signup.iamtimcorey.com/\n\nOne-off tutorials are awesome but they aren't the only thing you should be doing to learn C#. Another vital part of learning is learning how to put it all together. This interactive course is all about putting the pieces together. You can watch each video on its own or you can watch them in order and see a bigger picture. The choice is yours.\n\nThis course focuses on real-world development. As such, we are simulating that we work for TimCo Enterprise Solutions on a brand new product, the TimCo Retail Manager. Just like in the real world, we are starting out with one set of requirements but know that over time they will change."
