description: "http://g.co/gtac2013\nSlides: http://goo.gl/76Ggf\n\nAri Shamash, Google\n\nYou built an app. You launched it. You figured you'd get it out there, build up some volume, get some funding, throw it all out, and then start from scratch so you can \"do it right\".  But, demands for new features are sky high, you are now being asked to push towards unprecedented scale at an unheard of velocity. Yikes! Now what?\n\nYou cannot throw it away and start from scratch, you'll just need to evolve what you have, while continuing to add high quality features at breathtaking speed.  In addition, you need to ensure that what is already there doesn't break.  How do you do this? Fortunately, a new field is forming within the software engineering industry that addresses this common scenario: at Google, we call this \"test engineering\".\n\nThis talk will focus on what test engineering is, how it evolved from quality assurance, and how the industry as a whole has implemented test engineering (with specific examples of how it is implemented at Google)."
