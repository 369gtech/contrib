title: '"Daimio: A Language for Sharing" by Dann Toliver'
language: English
recordingDate: 1614313877
description: "Daimio is a new language for sharing functionality in safe and friendly ways. We'll explore the architectural possibilities this opens up, examine the techniques used to achieve security, consider it with respect to similar systems (dataflow, actors, CSP, FBP, FRP, RDP, etc), peek under the hood to see how it's built, use the available editing tools, and learn how to extend it.\n\nAlong the way we'll encounter a serverless MMO, create a modular synthesizer, experiment with video hacking, and experience collaborative projectional editing -- and we'll do it all in the browser. Bring your laptop. First three rows get wet.\n\nDann Toliver\nBento Miso\n@dann\n\nAuthor of Daimio. Make things at Bento Box. Co-founder of Bento Miso, a non-profit collaborative workspace focused on lowering barriers to entry in the technology world. Likes math.\n\nRecorded at the Emerging Languages Camp at Strange Loop (https://thestrangeloop.com) in St. Louis, MO, Sep 2013."
