description: "Google I/O 2010 - BigQuery and Prediction APIs \r\n\r\nApp Engine 101 \r\n\r\nAmit Agarwal, Max Lin, Gideon Mann, Siddartha Naidu \r\n\r\nGoogle relies heavily on data analysis and has developed many tools to understand large datasets. Two of these tools are now available on a limited sign-up basis to developers: (1) BigQuery: interactive analysis of very large data sets and (2) Prediction API: make informed predictions from your data. We will demonstrate their use and give instructions on how to get access. \r\n\r\nFor all I/O 2010 sessions, please go to http://code.google.com/events/io/2010/sessions.html"
