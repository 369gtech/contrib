description: "Igor Ebner de Carvalho, Microsoft\n\nAn important function in our job as SREs is being able to write code and review code, but even here we miss a lot of details and many bugs remain undiscovered. Why is this? A major part of the problem is how our brain works—we only see what we want to see. This talk will explain this important \"shortcoming\" of our brain and give some insights on how to overcome this problem by addressing common examples of code snippets that can easily lead to bugs and problems at scale.\n\nView the full SREcon18 Europe Program at: https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon18europe/program\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
