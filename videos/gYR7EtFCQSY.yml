While most Kubernetes clusters in public cloud are single-tenant, most of the enterprises run Kubernetes as managed multi-tenant clusters. All existing service mesh implementations are installed cluster wide, thus it discovers every service of the cluster and makes it available for consumption and breaks multi-tenancy for the cluster. Tenant application deployed on these enterprise clusters are run with restricted privileges and capabilities, hence also posing a challenge in adopting service mesh. In this talk, we will describe how we designed and operate our managed service mesh offering on kubernetes clusters, overcoming many of the current service mesh limitations, while exposing the full benefits of the technology to our enterprise customers. \n\nhttps://sched.co/YVxZ"
