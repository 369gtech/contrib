description: "Gary Bernhardt's famous WAT talk pokes fun at the weird things in Ruby and JavaScript due to weak typing and operator overloading. In it, he spends 4 minutes going through all sorts of weird behavior in Ruby and JavaScript, caused by the strange rules around automatic type promotion, operator overloading, and equality in those languages.\n\n\nGo developers watch videos like Wat and feel smug. After all, Go is a typesafe language with no automatic type promotion. Go avoids magic; we accept some verbosity as a fair price to pay for not having to memorize obscure rules. Right?\n\n\nWell, not entirely. Go has some weird corners, too. If you understand what's going on behind the scenes, the behavior makes sense. But if you haven't memorized the Go Language Specification, you will run into cases where the \"obvious\" behavior is not the \"actual\" behavior. Jon’s tutorial session looks at these oddball situations as a way to help everyone understand how Go is working behind the scenes."
