Subscribe to get our live notifications and our latest video releases from our meetups.\n\n---\nJoin co-hosts Remy Porter, Bruce Parr and Anne Jackson for \"Blame-free retrospectives,\" part of C&S' Engineering Management series. \n\nTopics include:\n- What is a retrospective (retro)?\n- Why should we do them?\n- What is a good retro?\n- Where do retros go wrong?\n- How do we adopt retros?\n- What are some tools to use? A retro “toolbox”\n- Guidance on building your own retro process.\n- Audience Q&A\n---\n\nFrom 00:00 to 16:45, the recording has a minor audio issue that causes speakers' voices to be lower than they are in reality and there is a barely audible ticking sound in the background. After that timestamp, there is momentarily silence and then their voices are normal. We apologize for this technical difficulty."
