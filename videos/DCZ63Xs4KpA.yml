title: '"Creating Intelligent Music Instruments with Machine Learning" - Charles Martin (LCA 2021 Online)'
recordingDate: 1612093914
description: "Charles Martin\n\nhttps://lca2021.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/46/\n\nCharles Martin's music computing lab at the ANU is leading research into creating new kinds of musical instruments that sense and understand music using machine learning. These instruments actively respond during performances to assist musicians. The tools exist to create these instruments today with single-board computers such as the Raspberry Pi and Beaglebone.\r\n\r\nWe envision that musical instruments of the future will do more than react to musicians. They will predict their human player’s intentions and sense the current artistic context. Intelligent instruments will shape their sonic output, seamlessly add expression to sounds, or even generate notes that the performer hasn’t played (yet!).\r\n\r\nIn this talk, Charles will discuss recent progress in creating intelligent musical instruments with machine learning. He’ll talk about what intelligent instruments might mean to musicians, to their music-making process, and what new music these tools can create. In particular, he'll introduce the process of developing intelligent musical instruments using the Raspberry Pi platform.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
