description: "Clinton Gormley\nhttp://berlinbuzzwords.de/sessions/testing-lucene-and-solr-various-jvms-bugs-bugs-bugs\n\nWe've had talks about how Elasticsearch can scale search and analytics to hundreds of nodes and terrabytes of data. We know it is up to the job, big or small. The question now is:\nHow do I use it? How do I go from a list of requirements to a functioning performant application?\n\nThis talk will take you from the beginning -- how to get your data into Elasticsearch -- through the process of tweaking the schema to support your search requirements. We will talk about how to construct complex queries using the query DSL, and the tools available for understanding search results. Finally, we will talk about using facets and suggesters to help your users navigate your data.\n\nBy the end of the talk, you should have a solid understanding of the tools available to you in Elasticsearch.\nAbout the speaker: \nClinton is a South African doctor turned programmer who now lives in Barcelona and works for Elasticsearch.com. He was the first user of Elasticsearch and is the author of ElasticSearch.pm, the official Perl API and other Perl modules for Elasticsearch."
