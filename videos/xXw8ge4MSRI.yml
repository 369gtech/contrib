recordingDate: 1477409534
description: "Data has long stopped being structured and flat, but the results of our analysis are still rendered as flat bar charts and scatter plots. We live in a 3D world, and we need to be able to enable data interaction from all perspectives. Robert Thomas offers an overview of Immersive Visualization—integrated with notebooks and powered by Spark—which helps bring insights to life.\n\nThis keynote is sponsored by IBM."
