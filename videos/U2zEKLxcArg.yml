title: 'From bulb to C# — how does computer work? - Adam Furmanek - NDC Sydney 2020'
language: English
recordingDate: 1630507219
description: "Computers — we use them every day for work, entertainment, discoveries or even house management. Our watches are more powerful than computers used by NASA to put a man on the Moon. But do we really know how they work? What is von Neumann architecture, microcode, x86 and other magical terms? How is it possible that this little thing performs more calculations than we could ever do in our lives?\n\nIn this talk we will see how it works. We will start with few bulbs emitting light and finish with computer capable of running the CLR. We will understand the magic behind it and what is actually going on \"under the hood\"."
