title: 'Master Tooling for Containers with DevOps (J. Deen)'
language: French
recordingDate: 1557218709
description: 'Microservices can be hard; understanding container best practices can be hard as those practices are still being discovered. This session aids in minimizing the learning curve with container orchestration, specifically Kubernetes, by bringing DevOps best practices into the mix. I show you how using container tooling specifically built for simplifying the process can provide better orchestration for cloud services, abstraction and encapsulation for your microservices deployments, and visibility into what runs where and why. You will not only walk away with a deeper understanding of this area, but also some hands-on material to help you get started.'
