description: "Cloud Foundry Growing Pains: Lessons Learned Keeping the Largest CF Environment Alive and Kicking - Michael Maximilien, IBM\n\nBluemix is the largest CF environment by far. It is also arguably the one with the most usage and users. Come to this talk to hear from the World Wide DevOps and development team who answers the call when things go wrong and who also help keep Bluemix up to date and running. \n\nWe plan to share what we have learned in the past year as we grew and encountered unexpected failures and how we dealt with them.\n\nAbout Michael (aka dr.max) Maximilien\nMy name is Michael Maximilien, better known as max or dr.max, and I am a computer scientist with IBM. At IBM Research Triangle Park, I was a principal engineer for the worldwide industry point-of-sale standard: JavaPOS. At IBM Research, some highlights include pioneering research on semantic Web services, mashups, and cloud computing, and platform-as-a-service. I joined the IBM Cloud Labs in 2014 and work closely with Pivotal Inc., to help make the Cloud Found the best PaaS."
