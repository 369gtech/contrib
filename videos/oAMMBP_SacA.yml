description: "Google I/O 2009 - From Spark Plug to Drive Train: Life of an App Engine Request\r\n\r\nAlon Levi\r\n\r\nApp Engine's serving architecture allows for real-time autoscaling without using virtualization. In this session, we'll explore the path of a single app engine request, from front end to appserver, and explain how App Engine's small app footprint permits thousands of applications to share a single appserver.\r\n\r\nFor presentation slides and all I/O sessions, please go to: code.google.com/events/io/sessions.html"
