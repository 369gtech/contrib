description: "Ближайшая конференция — Mobius 2020 Piter\n22-25 июня, Online\nПодробности и билеты: https://bit.ly/mobius2020piter\n\n. We want to take you on the journey through different layers of tests in an iOS app that’s used by more than half million unique users per month. Get to know the way we test it, step by step, layer by layer. We start with advanced code static analysis, continue with mutation, snapshot and functional tests. We carry on with continuous delivery, A/B tests and usability tests. We want to share with you which tools we are using and what testing practices we believe in. This is a true story driven by problems we experience at work, presented from tester’s and developer’s perspective."
