description: "We are living in a connected word, where unrestricted sharing of data becomes an ultimate goal. \nThis reflects the architecture of the software systems where the main focus is on building enterprise integrated solutions. \nEnterprise Integration Patterns (EIP) are used to architecture and design integrated solutions.   \n\nDuring the past decades following integration styles have been identified:\n- file transfer\n- shared DB\n- RMI\n- messaging\n\nAsynchronous messaging is the most used architectural style for enterprise integration. It allows building of the loosely coupled solutions which overcomes limitations of the remote communication.\n\nThis talk is about messaging, and the way Spring supports EIP via Spring Integration project.\nYou will learn:\nMessaging concepts and Enterprise Integration Patterns\nHow Spring Integration implements EIP\nReal-life examples with Spring Integration & Boot"
