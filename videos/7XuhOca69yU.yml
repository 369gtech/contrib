description: "The Internals of Metric Store - Todd Persen, Pivotal \n\nIn this talk, Todd will walk through the high-level source code of Metric Store and highlight its key components - ingress via Loggregator, persistence with the InfluxDB storage engine, querying using PromQL, and authorization with the CF Auth Proxy. After a thorough tour of this codebase, attendees should have a good grasp on the architecture and be able to build new applications that leverage the features of Metric Store and contribute to the open source project if they so desire. \n\nFor more info: https://www.cloudfoundry.org/"
