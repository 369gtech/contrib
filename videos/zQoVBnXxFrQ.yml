description: "This talk is about a paper “Invertible syntax descriptions”, and some real world use of the ideas therein.\n\nTraditionally, developers have written printers and parsers separately, even if the source and destination are intended to be isomorphic. We will go through the ideas of a paper, and then build up a library for writing JSON printers and parsers at the same time.\n\nBy unifying printers and parsers like this, we can reduce duplication, increase maintainability and get some correctness for free.\n\nTo understand what’s going on you will need to know:\n\n* Haskell, including a strong grasp of Functor, Applicative, Monad and Alternative type classes.\n* What JSON looks like\n* Roughly, what “isomorphism” means.\n\nTo fully appreciate some of the ideas, you may want to know:\n\n* Basic category theory (functors and isomorphisms)\n* What the Control.Lens notion of a Prism is.\n\nChristian has a background in Linux, systems administration, and software development.He is now leading a team of Haskell developers at a managed cloud hosting company, where they build PaaS products, internal tools, infrastructure and even dabble in a bit of analytics.\n\nHis current professional goal is to effect a more widespread commercial viability and acceptance of Haskell.\n\nFor more on YOW!
