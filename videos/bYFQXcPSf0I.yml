description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nPARSEC: A New Platform Abstraction for Security - Hugues de Valon & Ionut Mihalcea, Arm \n\nThis talk will present PARSEC, an open source security project that has been seeded by Arm in collaboration with Docker.  PARSEC adopts the best-of-breed security and cryptography APIs that are defined in the Arm-founded Platform Security Architecture (PSA). The PSA is a holistic framework that was originally created to ensure the security of constrained IoT devices, from threat modelling through to deployment and maintenance. But the PSA is now evolving beyond these original goals, such that it can adapt to protect edge and infrastructure deployments as well.  PARSEC is a part of this evolution. It enables key management and cryptographic services to be consumed on rich, multi-tenant platforms in any programming language. It does so in a way that is agnostic with respect to the underlying hardware.  You will learn about the PARSEC vision, its architecture, and about how it is providing a new developer experience for security.   \n\nhttps://sched.co/aO5Y"
