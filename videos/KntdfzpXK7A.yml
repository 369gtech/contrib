description: "Speaker: Nida Bouzid and Antoine Chambille\n\nIs there a limit to the size of the heap the Java Virtual Machine can handle? Java blogs often report 100GB as the maximum amount of memory the JVM will manage effortlessly. Yet at Quartet FS we develop \"ActivePivot\", an In-Memory analytical platform written in pure Java and that is commonly deployed on a terabyte of memory.\n\nBut the real story began when one of our customers challenged us to run a large credit risk use case on 16TB of memory. We managed to do it, but only when all the layers of the solution came together: data structures and thread management in the Java code, garbage collection in the JVM, memory management in the OS. \n\nIn this presentation we will share all the steps to achieve this.\n\nEvent Page: http://www.meetup.com/singasug/events/231984965/\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/R4Ag/"
