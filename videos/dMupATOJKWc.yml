description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2016\n—\nSG14 is the ISO C++ study group dedicated to programmers in the games, embedded and financial domain, focusing on a particular subset of use-cases: low-latency, real-time requirements and performance/efficiency. Convened in June 2015, it is the newest addition to the WG21 Study Group family, and it is the first to focus on an industrial domain rather than on a particular aspect of software development. We need your input: learn why and how at this talk.\n\nWith a thriving google group and regular, well attended teleconferences, several areas of investigation are subject to research. Expect discussion on cache-coherent containers, fixed-point representation, heterogeneous programming, and of course exception handling, as well as one or two diversions into the history of game development.\n\nYou may even come away with a desire to join this or any of the other study groups, and contribute ideas and papers to improve the language.\n— \nGuy Davidson\nCreative Assembly\nCoding Manager\nHorsham, UK\nCoding Manager of Creative Assembly, makers of the Total War franchise, Alien:Isolation and the upcoming Halo Wars sequel, Guy has been writing games since the early 1980s. He is now also a contributor to SG14, the study group devoted to low latency, real time requirements, and performance/efficiency especially for Games, Financial/Banking, and Simulations. He speaks at schools, colleges and universities about programming and likes to help good programmers become better programmers.\n\nNicolas Guillemot\nMSc Student, University of Victoria\nHi, nice to meet you! My name is Nicolas, and my main interests are game development, real-time rendering, graphics hardware and graphics APIs. I tackle problems at the intersection of designing efficient computer algorithms and leveraging the strengths of hardware. My favorite thing about C++ is that it lets me write detailed systems-level code and high-level GUI code together in a single robust language.\n\nSean Middleditch\nLead Engineer, Wargaming Seattle\nI make games.\n\nMichael Wong\nCodeplay Software/ISOCPP\nVP of R&D/Director\nMichael Wong is the CEO of OpenMP. He is the Canadian representative to the C++ Standard and OpenMP Committee. He is also a Director of ISOCPP.org and a VP, Vice-Chair of Programming Languages for Canada’s Standard Council. He has so many titles, it’s a wonder he can get anything done.\nHe chairs the WG21 SG5 Transactional Memory and SG14 Games Development/Low Latency, and is the co-author of a number C++11/OpenMP/Transactional Memory features including generalized attributes, user-defined literals, inheriting constructors, weakly ordered memory models, and explicit conversion operators. Having been the past C++ team lead to IBM’s XL C++ compiler means he has been messing around with designing C++ compilers for twenty years. His current research interest, i.e. what he would like to do if he had time is in the area of parallel programming, transactional memory, C++ benchmark performance, object model, generic programming and template metaprogramming. He holds a B.Sc from University of Toronto, and a Masters in Mathematics from University of Waterloo.\n\nHe has been asked to speak at ACCU, C++Now, Meeting C++, ADC++, CASCON, Bloomberg, CERN, and many Universities, research centers and companies.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
