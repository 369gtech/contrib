description: "When you ring the bell at a larger building, you may assume that you are actually operating a complex network with further call buttons, access control units checking smart cards and opening doors and of course intercom devices. But your call (and video) may also end up on a smart phone or the desktop pc of the people at the front desk. IP-Gateways between the established intercom bus systems and the IP world are used. We will discuss typical scenarios, where the intercom world meets the IP world. We picked two devices to have a closer look and focused on systems for larger installations and which can be used without the Cloud. We also assume such systems to be more widely adopted among enterprises and security conscious users.\n\n=== \n\nSebastian Neef is a security researcher at heart. At the age of 14, he discovered the security side of things and has been interested in it ever since. During his A-levels he became a freelancer in this field and started to consult various companies, including well known ones by participating in their bug bounty programs since 2012. Web and IoT topics are his core strengths and his research about sensitive files on web servers or exposed waterworks or wind power stations has been featured by popular German media in broadcasts as well as print. Neef likes to share his knowledge by either writing blog posts, giving conference talks or teaching students at the university’s hacker club (“AG Rechnersicherheit”). Also enjoys playing CTFs with ENOFLAG. 2019 he co-authored a book about IT security and is currently finishing his CS master degree at TU Berlin.\n\n--- \n\nJulian Beier is a master student at TU Berlin and a working student at HiSolutions. At work he looks at a variety of product and evaluates their level of security. Last Year for example he found bugs in a german messenger client and their management server. Together with his colleagues he also managed to demonstrate a way to gain access to two different telecommunication gateways. In his free time he successfully participates in CTFs with the team from TU Berlin.\n\n---\n\nLars Burhop just got into Security three years ago. But understanding how things work on the lowest level has always fascinated him. Staying on the tech side of things, most kids’ toys who include some circuits to manipulate. Therefore, it was no surprise that he would mayor in computer engineering. After some time, the curriculum was no longer enough to saturate with the right kind of information, so he joined the “AG Rechnersicherheit” and started to learn more and more about Security. A year later, just playing digital capture the flag games where no longer enough, and Lars joined HiSolutions to give his computer security interests a professional touch."
