description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2018\n—\nMuch has been said about how the upcoming module feature in C++ will improve compilation speeds and reduce reliance on the C++ preprocessor. However, program architecture will see the biggest impact. This talk explains how modules will change how you develop, organize, and deploy your code. We will also cover the stable migration of a large code base to be consumable both as modules and as normal headers.\n— \nJohn Lakos, Bloomberg LP\nSoftware Engineer\nJohn Lakos, author of Large-Scale C++ Software Design, serves at Bloomberg LP in New York City as a senior architect and mentor for C++ Software Development world-wide.  He is also an active voting member of the C++ Standards Committee’s Evolution Working Group. Previously, Dr. Lakos directed the design and development of infrastructure libraries for proprietary analytic financial applications at Bear Stearns. For 12 years prior, Dr. Lakos developed large frameworks and advanced ICCAD applications at Mentor Graphics, for which he holds multiple software patents. His academic credentials include a Ph.D. in Computer Science ('97) and an Sc.D. in Electrical Engineering ('89) from Columbia University. Dr. Lakos received his undergraduate degrees from MIT in Mathematics ('82) and Computer Science ('81). His next book, entitled Large-Scale C++—Volume I: Process and Architecture, is anticipated in 2018.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
