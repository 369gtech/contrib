description: "with Matthew Renze\n\nDoes your career as a software developer cause you stress? What are you currently doing to manage the negative health effects of this stress? Software developers are uniquely predisposed to certain stress-related mental-health issues. The key problem is that we evolved to survive in a wilderness context. However, these same survival adaptations are now in direct conflict with our modern high-tech world.\n\nIn this session, we will learn about the behavioral neuroscience of mindfulness practices. We’ll discuss practices like meditation, biofeedback, and neurofeedback. In addition, we will learn how we, as software developers, can use these practices to reduce stress, improve our mental health, and increase our focus. There will be NO new-age nonsense, mystical mumbo-jumbo, or quantum flapdoodle in this session… only research-based science… real science… in plain English."
