title: 'DEF CON Safe Mode Red Team Village - Sajal Thomas - Modern Red Team Tradecraft'
language: English
recordingDate: 1597890470
description: 'Modern attacks against complex network infrastructure highlight a massive gap between state-affiliated cyber espionage attacks and Red Teams. As Red Teams face challenges that real-world attackers do not, replicating the sophisticated threat groups becomes all the more challenging with tight engagement deadlines and report submissions. The talk aims to bridge this gap by providing insights into modern tradecraft employed by the apex predators as well as the coin-miners and ransomware authors. The talk will also discuss the unique relationship between speed and stealth during Red Team operations. Sometimes ""speed is the new stealth"" but with evolved defensive technologies that baseline behaviour of endpoints on the host and network level, slow and steady may be the way to go instead. Additionally, the talk will walk through publicly-known implant design considerations to defeat mature host and network defences. Bleeding-edge credential harvesting techniques and the evolution of running Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1 to digging deep into C/C++ and Win32 API programming will be featured. Lastly, the evolution of a modern Red Team operator/developer/both will be discussed. The skills and mindset required to successfully complete objectives and evade defences have changed over time. A Red Teamer must evolve to be able to inform defence better.'
