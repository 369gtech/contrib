language: English
recordingDate: 1437407796
description: "This talk introduces a minimal set of agile metrics for agile project management beyond the known ones as e.g. Velocity and Sprint Burndowns. We will talk about how these metrics are defined and how they are visualized while looking at some example scenarios.\n\nThe presented agile metrics are also the standard set, which Accenture as a world-wide IT service provider uses in his large-scale agile projects."
