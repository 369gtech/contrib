description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2019 by Wojciech Dziemianczyk, The New York Times.\n\nMore info: http://androidmakers.fr/schedule/?sessionId=VOK-7028\n\nDeveloper tools for pixel pushing are one of the more under-developed areas when it comes to Android. Pixel pushing itself is such a tedious process that eats up a lot of development time. Some teams are lucky enough to utilize tools like Figma and Zeplin, which help reduce time when translating designs into something tangible. Others still use the tried and true method of using redlines, screenshots, and photoshop! \n\nIn this talk we'll go through the journey of pixel pushing, the pain points, and some tips and tricks to help developers and designers speed things up. We'll then talk about Window, a new tool to help you master the art of pixel pushing.\nWindow is a new free open source tool with the goal of enhancing the process of pixel pushing.\n\nFirst is the Window Android App. It lets developers and designers measure, add rulers / grids, and verify placement of what you're seeing on screen. \n\nThe second is the Window Android library, to integrate into your projects. This library lets you export your Android UI and view it tools like Figma & Sketch. \n\nWe'll talk about how you can integrate two tools to help you simplify your workload and speed up development time!\n\nAlex Karp Production"
