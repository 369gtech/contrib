description: 'Crafting UI systems with a complex mutable state spread across the network is inherently difficult. This problem is still very new and thus doesnâ€™t have clear answers. At Grammarly, we have found the methodology that lets us tackle this complexity while keeping our codebase error-free and predictable. Our approach combines the pragmatic usage of functional programming with static typing. I will show you how functional programming can solve typical front-end problems in an effective and elegant way.'
