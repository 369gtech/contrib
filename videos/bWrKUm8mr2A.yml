title: 'Guy A  Narboni - Erliot: monitoring and control of smart connected devices - Code BEAM STO'
language: English
recordingDate: 1531481281
description: "With Erliot, we test the relevance of a design pattern for IoT applications, where every communicating ‘thing’ in the real world is twined with a live ‘object’ in the virtual world. This dedicated agent is in charge of tracking the most recent history of the device in particularly. Implemented as a lightweight process at the edge or in the cloud, it allows for translating, filtering, downsampling, fusion of information and triggering alerts on upstream flows. It serves as a proxy for all other interactions.\n\nThe flow to monitor is thus dispatched to a sea of processes, prior to reaching a datalake (if required). Although natural to an Erlang trained mind, this solution comes as an alternative to most present reference architectures for the Internet of Things.\n\nWe’ll report on first experiments with a smart building application.\n\nMore details on website: https://codesync.global/speaker/guy-a-narboni/"
