description: "Birds of a Feather: Radio Access Network LTE/CBRS Edge - John Studarus, Packet Host \n\nDiscussion on deploying and running Kubernetes clusters across micro datacenters supporting edge applications. In specific, we'll be talking about how Packet Host has architected its Kubernetes deployment to support these cell tower collocated clusters. We'll talk briefly about this new ecosystem of ultra-low latency networking via LTE and CBRS (Citizen Broadband Radio Service). We're interested in sharing our experience and then letting the conversation flow to hear how others are adapting to use this new ecosystem. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPXx"
