description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nDiscussion & Comments: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2019\n—\nThis talk is about a new feature in C++20 which has significant implications\nfor compile-time programming: allowing class types to be used in non-type\ntemplate parameters (NTTPs).\n\nSeveral talks at last year's CppCon pushed the boundaries of compile-time\nstring processing, with a common catch: reliance on an extension to C++'s UDLs\nthat the committee has been refusing to standardise since 2013. That extension\nprovides an easy way to get string data into the type system rather than just\ninto constexpr variables,\n\nThe talk will cover what that extension is, why it was never standardised, and\nhow class-type NTTPs make it unnecessary. We'll then talk about what can\nand can't be done with class-type NTTPs, what the challenges of adding them to the\nlanguage were, and take a look at some things they've been used for.\n— \nJeff Snyder\nPDT Partners\nVice President\n\nJeff is a software developer in London's financial services industry, and has \nbeen an active member of the C++ standards committee since 2013 focusing on \ncore language feature development. He started learning C++ around 2001, studied \nComputer Science at the University of Cambridge, and has spent the last 14 \nyears writing C++ professionally. He is interested in compile-time programming, \nmetaprogramming, and language features that enable more efficient programs \nwithout the need for low-level code. \n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
