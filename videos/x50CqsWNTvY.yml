This talk will cover the built-in ways Vue.js helps you animate your site, and how for more complicated animations you can hook into third party libraries. It'll also cover the basics of animation itself â€“ what to animate, what not to animate â€“ and how you can use animations to enhance your website without harming the experience of people with disabilities.\n\nThis event would not take place without the support of sponsors:\n\nðŸ¥‡ Gold Sponsors\nStackHawk â†’ https://www.stackhawk.com/\nAttest â†’ https://www.askattest.com/careers\nIonic â†’ https://ionicframework.com/\nTidelift â†’ https://tidelift.com/\nSentry â†’ https://sentry.io/\n\nðŸ¥ˆ Silver Sponsors\nStudio 3T â†’ https://studio3t.com/\nMaersk â†’ https://www.maersk.com/careers\nHasura â†’ https://hasura.io/"
