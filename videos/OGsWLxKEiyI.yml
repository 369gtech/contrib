recordingDate: 1279898211
description: "http://www.oscon.com \r\n\r\nFrancesco Cesarini has used Erlang on a daily basis for over 15 years, having started his career as an intern at Ericsson's computer science laboratory, the birthplace of Erlang. He moved on to Ericsson's Erlang training and consulting arm working on the first release of the OTP middleware, applying it to turnkey solutions and flagship telecom applications.\r\n\r\nIn 1999, soon after Erlang was released as open source, he founded Erlang Solutions. With offices in the UK, Sweden, Poland (and soon the US), they have become the world leaders in Erlang based consulting, contracting, training, systems development and support services. In 2008, they launched the Erlang Factory conferences. At Erlang Solutions, Francesco has worked on major Erlang based projects both within and outside Ericsson, and in his current role as CSO, is setting the strategy and vision of the company while supervising the technical teams.\r\n\r\nFrancesco is active in the Erlang community not only through regularly talks, seminars and tutorials at conferences worldwide, but also through his involvement in international research projects. He organises local Erlang user groups and with the help of his colleagues, runs the trapexit Erlang community website. He is the co-author of Erlang Programming, a book published by O'Reilly Media in 2009. With whatever time he has left over, he teaches Erlang to graduates and undergraduates at Oxford University and the IT University of Gothenburg. You can follow his ramblings (mainly on Erlang and Erlang Solutions) on twitter."
