React.js, webpack, modern JavaScript and CSS and more are all setup and waiting for you to install and start building.\n\nBring your own data\n\nGatsby’s rich data plugin ecosystem lets you build sites with the data you want. Integrate data from one or many sources: headless CMSs, SaaS services, APIs, databases, your file system, and more. Pull data directly into your pages using GraphQL.\n\nScale to the entire internet\n\nGatsby.js is Internet Scale. Forget complicated deploys with databases and servers and their expensive, time-consuming setup costs, maintenance, and scaling fears. Gatsby.js builds your site as “static” files which can be deployed easily on dozens of services.\n\nFuture-proof your website\n\nDon't build a website with last decade's tech. The future of the web is mobile, JavaScript and APIs—the JAMstack. Every website is a web app and every web app is a website. Gatsby.js is the universal JavaScript framework you’ve been waiting for.\nStatic Progressive Web Apps\nGatsby.js is a static PWA (Progressive Web App) generator. You get code and data splitting out-of-the-box. Gatsby loads an HTML file that’s a server rendered version of your React.js page then makes it live with JavaScript. Code and data for other pages get preloaded so clicking around the site feels incredibly fast.\n\nSpeed past the competition\n\nGatsby.js builds the fastest possible website. Instead of waiting to generate pages when requested, pre-build pages and lift them into a global cloud of servers—ready to be delivered instantly to your users wherever they are."
