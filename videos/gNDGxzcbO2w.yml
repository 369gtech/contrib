description: "Google Tech Talks\nFebruary 21,2007\n\n\nABSTRACT:\n\nWith the advent of worms, passive malcode, and sophisticated attackers, the \"Big Firewall\" model of security has failed. To build robust commercial networks in the future, security will need to move into the LAN infrastructure.\n\nThe LAN vantage point requires a nearly two-order-of-magnitude cost/performance improvement over conventional network intrusion detection and response. In this talk, I introduce the rational for LAN-centric defences and the difficulties in implementing for these targets. I will then discuss our work on Shunting, a technique which enables the Bro intrusion detection to operate at Gigabit line rate with the addition of a..."
