description: 'Adopting containers at scale is fundamentally a cultural change. In late 2015, PayPal decided to migrate en masse to containers for applications built on many different frameworks over the last 15 years. It was a bold and strategic plan that included how to showcase value of containers to leadership, a phased execution strategy, building the right team to lead, and cultural transformation. Changing application code, deployment methods, and operational tools were at onset non-negotiable. This session will share how the plan was pitched and the learnings that unfolded as PayPal carefully changed everything - and nothing at the same time - to get to 150,000 containers running in production in 2 years.'
