title: 'Dynamic M2M Event Processing: Oracle Event Processing and OSGi on Oracle Java Embedded'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433784708
description: "As M2M gateways and aggregator devices continue to expand the ever-widening array of sensors and sensor protocols they manage, the number of data events being generated is growing exponentially. Some events need to be acted upon locally; others need to be sent to the cloud for global analysis. Some events require immediate action; other events can wait for later processing. More importantly, the M2M ecosystem needs the ability to dynamically change the local analytics and business rules, depending on the global analytics in the cloud. This presentation demonstrates how Oracle Event Processing for Oracle Java Embedded and OSGi enable dynamic M2M event processing to power the device-to-data-center ecosystem.\n\n\nAuthors:\nOleg Kostukovsky\nundefined\nView more trainings by Oleg Kostukovsky at https://www.parleys.com/author/oleg-kostukovsky\n\nWalt Bowers\nundefined\nView more trainings by Walt Bowers at https://www.parleys.com/author/walt-bowers\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
