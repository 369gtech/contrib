Would you like to know how this all works and how we'll end up having all of our jobs stolen by soulless machines?\n\nSure, but you've heard that this implies tons of matrix calculus, algebra that doesn't always seem to be that linear, partial derivatives and, come on, if we chose programming rather than pursuing a PhD in Mathematics, we knew what we were doin'!\n\nOkay, give me 3 hours and I will tell you, in very simple words, without any prior knowledge required, step by step baby, how neural networks work in real life, how we get them to learn very useful tricks such as how to differentiate (pun intended) cats from dogs or recognize traffic signs in real time, and how we use these networks in practice.\n\nAnd we'll see that, thanks to libraries such as TensorFlow or Keras, a few lines of code are enough to do wondersâ€¦\n\nReady?\n\nYannis Bres \nFrom Forcepoint\nStarted coding at 8, wrote enterprise software at 17, went for a PhD, did some teaching at uni and never stopped learning or sharing knowledge since.\n\nI'm passionate about software engineering, especially about performance, code parallelization, good practices for code reliability and Deep Learning !\n\nCurrently Lead Software Architect at Forcepoint, working on our management platform for enterprise firewalls, especially our \"Big Data\" processing subsystem.\n\nI'm also co-lead of the Riviera JUG and the Riviera DEV conference [www.rivieradev.fr/]."
