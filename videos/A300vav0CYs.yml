description: "If a security vulnerability is reported in a common java library today, would you be able to identify affected applications and repair your whole organization before dinner time? In this talk, we're going to stitch together a continuous delivery platform, application monitoring, automated canary analysis, and organization-wide code search to show you how you can identify affected applications in minutes and repair your organization's code. We'll start with the assumption that we are working with a complex multi-platform (some K8S, some GCP, multiple Cloud Foundry foundations over private vSphere) environment like those found in many organizations. Some of the tools we'll demonstrate include Spinnaker for continuous delivery, Kayenta for automated canary analysis, Micrometer for metrics collection, Prometheus for monitoring, and Rewrite for code search.\n\nSpeakers\nJon Schneider\nPrincipal Software Engineer, Pivotal"
