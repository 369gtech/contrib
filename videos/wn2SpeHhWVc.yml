title: '[JSConfUS 2013] Selena Deckelmann: Schema liberation with JSON and PLV8'
recordingDate: 1376945804
description: "JSON is the lingua franca of the web. Postgres supports JSON natively and the PLV8 Javascript engine as an extension. Full Javascript is supported inside the database, including direct access to tables and important database features.\n\nAnd, developer-friendly features make it incredibly easy to transform your existing, normalized schemas into liberated JSON ones!\n\nTour of what putting a document store inside of Postgres looks like, including a look at a production use-case from Mozilla. crash-stats.mozilla.com is backed by a 2 TB Postgres database cluster that's adding about about 5 GB of JSON per week."
