recordingDate: 1573074703
description: "Elasticsearch is challenging to provision for a workload, as its performance is hard to model. Elasticsearch is also hard to troubleshoot when it comes to performance problems.\n\nThis talk will walkthrough the Performance Analyzer, a feature offered with Open Distro for Elasticsearch. Performance Analyzer is a system that instruments Elasticsearch and exposes metrics that have diagnostic capabilities.\n\nWe will cover the design and implementation of Performance Analyzer and will demo how it can be used in conjunction with the Open Distro PerfTop client to troubleshoot a cluster issue. Also, learn how you can get involved and contribute to this open source project.\n\nAlolita Sharma is a Principal Technologist at AWS.
