description: "Check out the latest from The Lead Developer at theleaddeveloper.com.\n\nIt takes time and trust for a team to learn to work together well, and if you’ve achieved that it’s not surprising that you want to keep it that way. But unexpected events can disrupt your team’s equilibrium: people leave to take up other opportunities, wider priorities and strategies shift, and organisations restructure themselves. Change is guaranteed, so how do you handle its impact on your team?\n\nYou can equip your team with an understanding of their context and empower them to work productively in times of uncertainty. In this talk you’ll learn some practical steps you can take as a leader to build an open, outward-facing team who take ownership of their work, help each other learn and embrace new challenges."
