description: "Intel’s Middle Out Journey to DevOps\n\nManish Aggarwal, Software Tech Lead, Intel\n\nSoftware quality matters. Thorough testing is a critical step that is often handled manually, introducing risk and delay and unpredictability in the process. Join us to hear how the Intel Avago QA team transformed their processes using DevOps principles to:\n\n- Continuously increase the quality of their testing and release pipeline\n- Eliminate manual handoffs and increase code coverage\n- Build and test any version of their software on any combination of hardware, on-demand\n- Re-use automation to cover more ground – Code Coverage, Memory Leaks, Binary Compatibility\n- Detect errors quickly to optimize for quality\n\nDOES16 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
