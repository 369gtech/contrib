description: 'In this lesson will introduce a column with a height of 10 pixels and this column will help us properly manage the vertical distance is between our elements. Weâ€™ll place it where we needed and usually, we have a 10 pixels gap between elements. By adding an extra column, we get an extra gap of 10 pixels as well as the column with 10 pixels so there''s 10 + 10 + 10 equals 30 pixels'
