Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nNATS 2.0 is the largest feature release since the original code base for the server was released. NATS 2.0 was created to allow a new way of thinking about NATS as a shared utility, solving problems at scale through distributed security, multi-tenancy, larger networks, and secure sharing of data. In this presentation, Derek will discuss the motives behind the newest features of NATS and how to leverage them to reduce total cost of ownership, decrease time to value, support extremely large scale deployments, and decentralize security to create secure and easy to manage modern distributed systems."
