description: 'With all the benefit Serverless platforms offer, “scalable applications with less infrastructure requirements”, and promoted as the dream environment you want to be in. However, migrating your monolith applications/microservices to Serverless can be tricky if it does require connectivity to your legacy systems, and there will be hidden costs and dangers of the shortcut. You need to think with a different mindset and look at from different perspectives than your cloud strategy and microservices design concerns, as each Serverless application will/may create latency, require alternative methods of caching, and logging, and last but not least, you need to secure each one with an isolated as well as a collective context. Attend this talk to learn more about the questions you need to ask before designing your Serverless applications, how you can safely migrate your applications, and also the tools available to make your journey easier. By the end of this talk, you will: - Understand the challenges Serverless platform will create your systems - Learn about the design options to make your applications secure, if/how/when you need to integrate with API gateways and other cloud resources'
