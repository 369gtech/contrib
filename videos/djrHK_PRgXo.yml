description: 'Founder of ThingK.io, an early stage stealth startup in London, UK. Darach is a polyglot programmer who has spent 20 years building distributed event based systems for investment banks, networking hardware manufacturers ( literally the internet that connects the internet of things ) and gaming and gambling environments. He also flies drones with coffee machines and gets robots to referee humans playing 2 player games. A simple device for teaching kids ( & adults ) programming in a fun way.'
