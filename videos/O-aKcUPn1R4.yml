Cold, exhausted, and terrified for the next deadline, they remained shackled to the very end of the web design process along with their developers. Until those dreaded moments when the large metal door opened and the next Photoshop comp walked in and forced them to create his likeness with pixel perfection, again and again.\n\nBut then the devices came.\n\nThe devices began to infiltrate the world of the Designers, complicating their workflows and adding frustration to their projects. Some Designers saw that this was not the way and called themselves Responsive. These brave rebels set out to free HTML and CSS, and team up with them to create an effective web design tool: the web-based mockup.\n\nAbout Stephen: https://www.the-haystack.com\nAbout Mobilism: https://mobilism.nl\n\nVideography generously sponsored by Mirabeau: https://www.mirabeau.nl"
