description: "In this video tutorial, I'll go over the \"typeclass\" design pattern in Scala, a very powerful technique for keeping your software architectures modular, decoupled and open to extension. Originally implemented as a Haskell language feature, the typeclass pattern in Scala leverages implicits to achieve additional flexibility and control.\n\nThis video is aimed at developers with some basic experience in Scala and assumes a bit of background with algebraic data types (sealed traits and case classes), implicits and general object-oriented design.\n\n** for more free Scala resources, head to http://marakana.com/s/tags/scala"
