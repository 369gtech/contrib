description: "Richard Bondi, Google\n\nWithin an SRE organization, teams usually develop very different automation tools and processes for accomplishing similar tasks. Some of this can be explained by the software they support: different systems require different reliability solutions. But many SRE tasks are essentially the same across all software: compiling, building, deploying, canarying, load testing, managing traffic, monitoring, and so on.\n\nThere are two puzzles here: why does this diversity exist, and how can it be overcome so that SRE teams stop duplicating their development efforts?\n\nThis talk presents a solution to both puzzles using the ten-year history of a single SRE tool. The tool is used only internally at a large company. It is one of the rare tools there that has been adopted widely by our very large SRE organization.\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
