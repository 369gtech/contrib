title: 'En, Making the case for write-optimized database algorithms / Mark Callaghan (Facebook)'

description: "Зал Сингапур, 8 ноября, 13:00\n\nПрезентация и тезисы:\nhttp://www.highload.ru/2016/abstracts/2442.html\n\nWrite-optimized database algorithms have been available in NoSQL products for many years. With MyRocks, the RocksDB storage engine for MySQL, we are using a write-optimized algorithm for a SQL DBMS. This talk will explain why we created MyRocks and how to compare write-optimized algorithms with the ubiquitous B-Tree in terms of read, write and space efficiency. A large MySQL deployment at Facebook is in the process of migrating from InnoDB to MyRocks. With RocksDB storage engines for MySQL and MongoDB and the Vinyl storage engine for Tarantool we think it is likely that you can consider a write-optimized database engine in the next few years."
