We’ll look at how to go beyond just including ActiveModel::Model to implement a rich set of Active Model features, including the recently-added Rails 5 Attributes API. How does this compare to Active Resource? What does it look like in your controller? We’ll answer these questions by exploring an example that wraps Square’s Customers API in a full-featured Rails model."
