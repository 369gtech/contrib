Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\n5G and Challenges with Software Supply Chain Security - Fatih Degirmenci, Ericsson\n\nThe new technologies such as cloud, containers, virtual & cloud native network functions result in tremendous advances in the telecommunications industry.\nWith the help of these new technologies, the 5G networks that are currently being rolled out all around the world are developed rapidly in heavily disaggregated manner, allowing communications service providers to introduce new services to their users much faster than before.\n\nHowever, the new technologies and resulting disaggregation is not without their challenges and the security of the software supply chain is one of them.\nThe components that are part of the 5G networks originate from multiple sources, including but not limited to vendors and open source communities with many integration points and deployed into different environments such as public and private clouds, increasing the risk of breaking the chain of trust.\n\nThis session will give a short overview of the next generation telecommunications networks, highlight the challenges, and talk about the opportunities to tackle them in a collaborative manner."
