description: "Oblivious Multi-Party Machine Learning on Trusted Processors\n\nOlga Ohrimenko, Felix Schuster, and CÃ©dric Fournet, Microsoft Research; Aastha Mehta, Microsoft Research and Max Planck Institute for Software Systems (MPI-SWS); Sebastian Nowozin, Kapil Vaswani, and Manuel Costa, Microsoft Research\n\nPrivacy-preserving multi-party machine learning allows multiple organizations to perform collaborative data analytics while guaranteeing the privacy of their individual datasets. Using trusted SGX-processors for this task yields high performance, but requires a careful selection, adaptation, and implementation of machine-learning algorithms to provably prevent the exploitation of any side channels induced by data-dependent access patterns.\n\nWe propose data-oblivious machine learning algorithms for support vector machines, matrix factorization, neural networks, decision trees, and k-means clustering. We show that our efficient implementation based on Intel Skylake processors scales up to large, realistic datasets, with overheads several orders of magnitude lower than with previous approaches based on advanced cryptographic multi-party computation schemes.\n\nView the full USENIX Security '16 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity16/technical-sessions"
