Award-winning author of Nexus novels, Naam gives a whirlwind tour of the frontier of the ultimate Human Computer Interface, and how it will change all of us.\n\n\n\nRamez speaks around the world on innovation, exponential technology, and solutions in climate and energy, and invests in innovative energy startups. His work has appeared in or been quoted in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Economist, The Atlantic, Slate, Business Week, Discover, Wired, and Scientific American.
