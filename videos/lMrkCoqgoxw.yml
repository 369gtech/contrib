recordingDate: 1305306596
description: "Dominic Mazzoni, Rachel Shearer\r\n\r\nProviding a basic HTML site used to be the best way to make sure your content was accessible to all users. But times have changed, and now you can use HTML5 techniques to provide an experience that's just as rich and interactive for people who use assistive technology. The emphasis of this talk will be on techniques that work today in the latest browser versions. Techniques covered will include proper use of ARIA along with focus management and keyboard navigation."
