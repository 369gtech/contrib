description: "Yesterday Adobe held their annual Adobe Max conference where they announced all the updates to their major apps like Photoshop, Premiere Pro, After effects and even some new apps.\nToday I want to take a look at their brand new Photoshop announcement for the iPad. In the future adobe is also planning to bring other apps such as adobe illustrator to tablet devices.\n\nLet's take a look if Photoshop for the iPad can compare to the desktop equivalent and if it's worth spending on that adobe creative cloud subscription.\nAll the code will be available on patreon.\n\nCheck out my courses!\nhttps://developedbyed.com/\n\nüéÅSupport me on Patreon for exclusive episodes, discord and more!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/dev_ed\n\nüõ¥ Follow me on:\nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/developedbyed\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/developedbyed\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/developedbyed/\nGithub: https://github.com/developedbyed/\n\n#adobe #ipad"
