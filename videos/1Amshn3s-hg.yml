The transfer of the Java EE technologies to Eclipse Foundation also opens up for very interesting synergies and collaboration with the Eclipse MicroProfile projects. This session will give you an update on the current state of Jakarta EE and look ahead at how the continued development of the platform will look like.\n\nIn this session, you will be able to ask questions to a panel consisting of a number of participants in the Jakarta EE Working Group."
