title: 'Integrate Machine Learning into Your Spring Application in Less than an Hour'
language: English
recordingDate: 1601027613
description: "Spring Boot, now the most popular Java framework, has simplified implementation of Java applications. Despite its broad appeal, there are few options to easily integrate machine learning (ML) natively in Java. Existing solutions such as stock APIs often don’t meet customized application requirements, and developing customized solutions is time consuming and not cost-effective. In this session, we’ll demonstrate how Java users can integrate ML into their Spring applications in less than an hour with Deep Java Library (DJL). We’ll develop an image recognition microservice and integrate this capability into an application, demonstrating common deep learning use cases around object detection and classification.\n\nHermann Burgmeier: Senior Software Engineer, Amazon; \nQing Lan: Software Developement Engineer, AWS;\nMikhail Shapirov: Senior Partner Solutions, Amazon Web Services, Inc;\nVaibhav Goel: Sr. Software Development Engineer, Amazon\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/integrate-machine-learning-into-your-spring-application-in-less-than-an-hour"
