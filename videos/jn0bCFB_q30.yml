description: "When you are driving a car today, you are driving a hugely powerful computer system that happens to have wheels and steering. There’s nothing on a car that is not mediated by a computer. At the core of all this is the Controller Area Network or CAN bus called as the central nervous system of a car which does intra-vehicular communication. But CAN is inherently insecure and fails to implement basic security mechanisms. This talk is going to be a practical guide on reverse-engineering the CAN bus packets using Instrument Cluster Simulator called ICSim. The talk is going to introduce you to Vehicle Network, ECU, vehicle Protocols, CAN Bus protocol, Reverse Engineering of CAN bus, identification of the arbitration ID of a specific vehicle event, replay attacks, send commands on your CAN Bus and also an introduction to several hardware tools needed. \n\n=== \n\nYogesh is a Cyber Security Analyst at Tata Consultancy Service, India where his primary research areas focus on IoT Security, hardware hacking and Mobile Application Security. He is currently responsible for corporate information security, including vulnerability assessment and penetration testing. A passionate communicator, Yogesh’s talk has been delivered/accepted at several conferences like FOSS Asia Summit Singapore, Global Azure Bootcamp Bhubaneswar, Open Source Summit China, Sector Canada (2019) and more. His research/talks have been featured at several conferences like recently at Open Source Summit China. Apart from that, he is an avid developer who works on multiple projects that make use of machine learning, IOT, and Robotics."
