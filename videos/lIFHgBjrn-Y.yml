description: "Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM) is an SDK for cross-platform mobile development. It uses the multiplatform capabilities of Kotlin and includes various tools and features designed to make the end-to-end experience of building mobile cross-platform applications efficient and enjoyable.\n\nKMM has recently gone Alpha, so in this talk, I want to tell you how you can make your applications crossplatform with KMM, when KMM is a good choice for your project and why today is a good day to start.\n\nWe will go through the development process of a typical mobile application and see how we can use KMM features to share code between platforms."
