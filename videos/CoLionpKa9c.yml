Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nKeynote: Building a Service Mesh From Scratch - The Pinterest Story - Derek Argueta, Senior Software Engineer, Tesla \n\n2 years ago Pinterest began rolling out Envoy as the ingress load balancer for its dynamic web traffic. Since then they've expanded Envoy's footprint to include service-to-service HTTP and Thrift communication while supporting Kubernetes and non-Kubernetes deployments with a powerful homegrown control plane. Derek works on the Pinterest Traffic Team and led the initial rollout of Envoy for ingress load balancing. In this talk Derek will provide a comprehensive overview of how Pinterest's service mesh evolved from static configuration files to a dynamic centralized control plane, and explore some of the challenges in adapting a service mesh to legacy infrastructure as well as the benefits it has provided.\n\nhttps://sched.co/ZfGp"
