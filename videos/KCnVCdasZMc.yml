description: 'We have entered the 4th industrial revolution, a time marked by the interconnection of hyper-instrumented physical, biological, and digital worlds. The accompanying pace of technological development will exert profound changes in the way people live and work, impacting all disciplines, economies, and industries.   Preparing the cybersecurity workforce for the changes that will reframe their careers requires insight and a vision of our possible future. Next-generation security professionals will both leverage and work alongside purpose-based digital assistants to help navigate the explosion of data created by intelligent ecosystems. These virtual assistants will replace current knowledge management platforms/intranets, dashboards, and manage any security process that can be automated.  As machine learning and cognitive solutions evolve in sophistication, security teams must re-examine how they organize work, design jobs, and plan for future growth.  Let''s futurecast near term technological trends and identify the concrete steps all security professionals need in the Age of the Intelligent Ecosystem and the Augmented Workforce.'
