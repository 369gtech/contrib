description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2017\n—\nIn 2003 we published \"C++ Templates - The Complete Guide\". Now, 14 years and 3 major C++ versions later, we are publishing the second edition. The content grew and changed dramatically. And I, the representative application programmer among the authors, learned a lot while at the same time shaking my head again and again. \n\nThis talk is a personal overview of the changes Modern C++ brought to generic C++ programming and what that means for ordinary application programmers. It's not only about new features, it's also about the discussions we had regarding style and usability (for example, about our recommendations of how to declare parameters in function templates).\n— \nNicolai Josuttis: IT Communication\n\nNicolai Josuttis (http://www.josuttis.com) is an independent system architect, technical manager, author, and consultant.
