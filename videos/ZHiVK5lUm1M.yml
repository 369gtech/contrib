description: "Andrew Gregovic\nArchitect\nPayPal\n\nIndustry opinions on relational databases can be more polarizing than Donald Trump. No one can deny document-oriented, graph databases, column-oriented and other non-traditional data stores are some of key technologies in the BigData / highly scalable space. Yet, the fundamental questions of what relational databases truly mean, and why they are still relevant are typically very poorly understood. The objective of this talk is to dispel decades of fog caused by lack of understanding computer science fundamentals and loose standards across the industry."
