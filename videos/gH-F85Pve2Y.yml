description: "The high transaction speed, lack of traceability, and multi-national nature of cryptocurrencies make them prime targets for small-time thieves and well-financed attackers alike. As such, cryptocurrency exchanges continually face a barrage of website/API attacks, sophisticated takeover attacks of their customers' accounts, malicious code embedded in 3rd-party software components, and security attacks on the underlying cryptocurrencies. This presentation discusses these attacks and the novel defenses that exchanges are implementing.\n\nNeil Smithline\nSecurity Architect, Circle\nNeil has been focused on application security for the past 20 years, working at numerous companies including BEA Systems/Weblogic and Autodesk.
