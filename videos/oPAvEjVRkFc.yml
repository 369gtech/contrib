description: 'Doing benchmarking right isn''t easy: anything can just gone wrong with the many optimisations that a modern JVM can do. What make things even more complex is that using new tools (like JMH) won''t help but to have a sharper razor to be cut with: learning by (negative) examples what to NOT do while benchmarking is an entertaining and useful way to learn how to do them right.'
