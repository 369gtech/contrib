This session will also premiere the Cold War platform, giving you examples and tools for you to produce simulations based on the concepts in the talk. \n\nEvent Page: http://www.meetup.com/Singapore-JS/events/226393928/\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/WCfg/"
