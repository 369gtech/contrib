title: 'Use of Customer Insights for Innovation - Rahul Venkatram'
recordingDate: 1505132719
description: "Most companies either have a “R&D driven” or a “Customer driven” approach towards innovation. And more often than not, these methodologies fail in giving a realistic picture of the “true value of innovation”. I would like to introduce something known as “Outcome driven innovation” and discuss why this is a better and more practical approach. We are currently using this methodology in my company and I would like to share some insights. \n\nRahul Venkatram is a graduate from the Faculty of Engineering in Lund University. He has over 13 years of experience working in technology companies, with 9 years in Ericsson and SONY in various leadership roles. Rahul currently works as a Product Manager in Bruel and Kjær, a Danish company that produces measurement systems in the field of noise and vibration.\n___________________________\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry in the Malmö/Lund region. Foo Café is aimed at those interested in sharing and learning.\n\nBorn out of the desire to create a year round conference like atmosphere, Foo Café is THE place for planned and spontaneous meetings of all sizes and interests within the IT arena.\nEnjoy a coffee or a cold beer, along with light pub fare, and engage with other like minded individuals interested in sharing their knowledge and learning from one another. Foo Café is sourced by individuals, small, medium and goliath-sized enterprises, as well as entrepreneurs. Awaiting you, after stepping over the Foo Café threshold, is a space that is recruitment and product placement safe!\n\nWe look forward to igniting inspiration and creativity year round to patrons of Foo Café."
