description: "What is your organization's most valuable asset? Is it your many accolades, the high dollar projects won, or perhaps the awesome office space you get to work in each day? If you aren't sure, or answered yes to any of the above - this session is for you.\n\nIn an industry where it is so easy to get caught up in looking at what the other folks are doing to win more projects, be more hip, or craft the better blog post of the \"top 5 ways to be really awesome at all the webby things\", we can all use a reminder to harness the power of what really sets any business apart: your people. The unique, collective experience of the people around you (or just yourself!) is hands down the most marketable asset that will give your business the edge it's been looking for.\n\nIn this session, we'll talk about how to cut through the noise that can often be caused by trying to keep up with industry trends, and how to get to the heart of what your organization - large or small - really has to offer to the world. Every single team member has something to offer to your potential clients that is marketable, and helps set your team apart from the competition, or even makes you a great potential partner for other businesses, digital agencies and Drupal shops.\_\n\nJoin in on this session to learn more about:\n\nways to uncover the hidden strengths of your team\nco-marketing with current customers\ndefining your key differentiators\_\nquestions to ask your clients\nhow to make the most of in person events"
