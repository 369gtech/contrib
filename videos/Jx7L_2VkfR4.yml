title: 'Why There Aren’t More Women in Tech - Moran Weber (Hebrew)'
recordingDate: 1506590598
description: 'There has been a substantial increase in the percentage of women who studied in the Academia ever since the 1960s; an increase that was more or less equal in all fields. But something happened in the 1980s that made this percentage drop, solely in the computer science field. Those numbers haven’t changed much since then. In this talk, Moran explains the factors and processes that account for these numbers, providing some statistics from the current Israeli market. She then continues by demonstrating how gender stereotypes affect our reality and shape our experience, perceptions, thoughts and behaviours, even when they’re totally unconscious. Finally, Moran offers practical suggestions that can lead to actual change.'
