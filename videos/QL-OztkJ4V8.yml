description: "Hacking Helm - Paul Czarkowski, Pivotal & Scott Rigby, Codeacademy \n\nHelm is the best way to build, package, and run Kubernetes manifests. However it has been considered by some as a fairly insecure way to deploy software, mostly due to its server component Tiller. Letâ€™s put that to the test and hack (and then protect from those hacks) Helm.  Paul will talk about the architecture behind Helm (v2) and how it is seen as particularly vulnerable to hacks designed to either gather information about deployed applications and even access the kubernetes cluster itself. Paul will then demonstrate several hacks in growing sophistication that do exactly that and then show how to protect yourself from those attacks. Paul will finish with a summary of how you can use Helm as securely as possible. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPXN"
