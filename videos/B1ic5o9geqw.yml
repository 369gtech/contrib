title: 'Learn Complex Skills, From Anywhere: Combining Django, Ansible and OpenStack to teach any tech skill'
recordingDate: 1548371780
description: "Florian Haas\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/121/\n\nProfessional skill-building is challenging, particularly when the skill to acquire is about distributed, scalable platform technology. In this talk, I cover an open-source skill-building platform that is 100% Python: built on Open edX and heavily involving Django, Ansible, and OpenStack.\r\n\r\nThe information technology industry is currently dealing with an interesting challenge in professional skill-building: almost every new technology developed in recent years has been complex, distributed, and built for scale: Kubernetes, Ceph, and OpenStack can serve as just a few representative examples. Loose coupling, asynchronicity, and elasticity are just some of the qualities frequently found in such systems that were entirely absent in many of the systems we built only a few years ago. As a result, people comfortable with building and operating these complex systems are hardly found in abundance, and organisations frequently struggle to adopt these technologies as a direct result of this scarcity: we are dealing with a skills gap, not a technology gap.\r\n\r\nThis means that we need novel ways to educate professionals on these technologies. We must provide professional learners with complex, distributed systems to use as realistic learning environments, and we must enable them to learn from anywhere, at any time, and on their own pace. One excellent way of doing this is to use the capabilities of the Open edX platform to integrate a learning management system with hands-on, on-demand lab environments that can be just as complex, and just as distributed, as production systems. This allows anyone interested to develop a professional skill set on novel technology at minimal cost, and without the need for costly hardware platforms for evaluation.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will give a rapid technical introduction to the core components of this free and open source (AGPL 3/ASL 2) all-Python platform:\r\n\r\n* edx-platform, the core learning management system (LMS) and content management system (CMS), built on Django;\r\n* edx-configuration, the automated deployment facility to roll out the Open edX platform, built on Ansible;\r\n* and finally, the Open edX XBlock extension system and its integration with OpenStack, also itself an all-Python cloud platform, in order to provide on-demand lab environments from both private and public cloud environments.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
