language: English
recordingDate: 1531993186
description: 'Rob can eat three pizzas in 15 minutes, down a pint of Guinness in less than 4 seconds and has been known to occasionally write code in between these dangerous eating and drinking binge sessions. Originally hailing from a small island in Europe (Isle of Man), living on a slightly larger island for a few years (England), he now lives in Belgium which really isn''t that much different except the beer is stronger and the trains are cheaper and mostly run on time. He gets paid to help developers do better things, doesn''t really care about one framework or another and prefers to spend his time outside of this building awful games for the browser.'
