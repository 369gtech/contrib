title: 'YOW! 2016 Bernadette Hyland - Linking Open Government Data at Scale'
recordingDate: 1487289893
description: "Governments collect a lot of data. Data on air quality, toxic chemicals, laws and regulations, public health, and the census are intended to be widely distributed. Some data is not for public consumption.\n\nThis talk focuses on open government data — the information that is meant to be made available for benefit of policy makers, researchers, scientists, industry, community organisers, journalists and members of civil society.\n\nWe’ll cover the evolution of Linked Data, which is now being used by Google, Apple, IBM Watson, governments, non-profits, and thousands of others worldwide.\n\nNext we’ll delve into the evolution of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Open Data service that we implemented using Linked Data and an Open Source Data Platform. Highlights include how we connected to hundreds of billions of open data facts in the world’s largest, open chemical molecules database PubChem and DBpedia.\n\nBernadette is founder of five startups, supports several widely used Open Source Software projects, and is a champion for Government Open Data. Previously she wrote real-time Unix based trading systems for Goldman Sachs in New York and Tokyo. For fun, she helps out at her local makerspace teaching Arduino skills and gives talks at local high schools on the value of STEM skills. Bernadette is a W3C Invited Expert and co-chaired the international Government Linked Data Working Group. She is the author of W3C Recommendations on Linked Data and has published several peer reviewed chapters in the topic. She speaks regularly on open government data, innovation and entrepreneurship in the U.S., Europe and Australia. Bernadette was a founding board member of Women in IT (WIT) in Brisbane Australia (1998).\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
