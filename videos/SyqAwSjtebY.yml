description: "This session shows the basics of using the Truffle AST interpreter framework and the Graal VM to implement Ruby as part of the JRuby project. Instead of involving bytecode generation, the compiler for Truffle languages is automatically provided by a partial evaluation of this interpreter when running on the Graal VM. This approach produces a language implementation that is dramatically faster than is possible with JRuby’s bytecode generator. The presentation then shows how more-advanced features, such as pragmatic access to the current environment, are elegantly and efficiently expressed with Truffle. Finally, it shows how features that have been impossible to implement up to now in JRuby, such as zero-overhead tracing, are possible in Truffle.\n\n\nAuthors:\nChris Seaton\nI am a PhD student at the University of Manchester, where I am researching programming languages and irregular parallelism. I am also a member of the Virtual Machine research group at Oracle Labs, where I work on implementing programming languages using the next generation of Java Virtual Machine.\n\nIn my spare time I develop an award winning medical app that is the first app regulated as a medical device in the UK, and run a consultancy to help clients such as the NHS to develop revolutionary medical software.\n\nBetween my undergraduate degree and starting my PhD I commissioned as an officer in the British Army, first in the regulars and now in the reserves. I've led both on operations and in training units in the UK and around the world.\nView more trainings by Chris Seaton at https://www.parleys.com/author/chris-seaton-1\n\n Thomas Wuerthinger\nThomas Würthinger is a Senior Research Manager at Oracle Labs.
