description: "Now that Java is supporting lambda expressions, it’s time to hone our skills to make use of them. Lambda expressions can help create concise code, but it takes more than learning the syntax to put them to good use. In this session, you will learn the idiomatic use of lambda expressions, explore ways we can use them to solve common tasks, and look into libraries and APIs that make use of them in Java.\n\n\nAuthor:\nVenkat Subramaniam\nDr. Venkat Subramaniam is an award-winning author, founder of Agile Developer, Inc., and an instructional professor at the University of Houston.\n\nHe has trained and mentored thousands of software developers in the US, Canada, Europe, and Asia, and is a regularly-invited speaker at several international conferences.
