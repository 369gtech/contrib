description: "We will demonstrate how to build machine learning software pipelines using Spring framework, J2EE, Weka and redis for leveraging real time social media data to create resource maps for humanitarian organizations during large-scale natural disasters. The pipeline involves creating coupled modules for harnessing the power of the crowd to initially tag social media data; invoking machine learning classifiers to automate data tagging in real time and pushing the results on geo-referenced maps. Our application has revolutionized the use of social media in large-scale humanitarian relief efforts.\n\nJi Lucas is a software specialist who likes to translate research output into high-quality prototypes that can be consumed by end users across many domains. Ji Lucas is passionate about ensuring that the scientific “Discovery” gets “Delivered” into concrete products.\n\n[RVO-9682]"
