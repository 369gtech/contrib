description: "At eBay we are re-inventing how we build our web front-end in a way that scales to hundreds of teams and can handle eBay-scale traffic. Each team manages and develops their own independent application. Over the past few years, teams have been migrating to a Node.js stack using Marko as the view layer. We chose to invest in Marko because it offers up to 10x performance improvement in server-side rendering performance under Node.js compared to competing solutions. Marko is open source and has enabled teams to build reactive, UI component-based apps that stream HTML from the server to deliver SEO-friendly pages that load quickly and minimize the time to first byte.\n\nEVENT:\n\nNodeSummit 2017\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nPatrick Steele-Idem\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nNode Summit Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to publish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nNode Summit 2018 event registration: http://www.nodesummit.com/registration/"
