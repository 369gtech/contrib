language: English
recordingDate: 1605649889
description: 'When was the last time you got a Kubernetes cluster up and running and said, “Welp, now we’re done”? Probably never. The cluster is only one part of the puzzle. In this demo, you will see eight open source technologies that provide different aspects of operating Kubernetes. Get a technical demo of Kubernetes automation with Cluster API, use Kubeapps and Harbor to provide easy access to new applications, utilize Antrea and Contour to improve network performance, visualize the cluster with Octant, measure conformance with Sonobuoy, and save the day with Velero. There’s a lot more to Kubernetes than just the platform, and VMware is committed to open source and their communities so that we can all deliver better solutions.'
