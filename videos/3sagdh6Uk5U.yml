description: "Marc MERLIN\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/24/\n\nThis talk will look into the failures I've encountered in multiple fields, and learned from reading from other people's failures, a common practise in aviation that has saved countless lives in not re-creating failures and accidents out of ignorance.\r\nYou will also hopefully improve your spidey sense in things that could go wrong and ask the right questions or implement the right procedures or fixes before they become necessary after downtime.\r\nAs they say in aviation \"experience is a cruel teacher: she gives you the test first, and if you survive, then you get to learn the lesson\".\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n- how to avoid spectacular lipo fires or circuit burns\r\n- when aviation goes wrong, from AF447, QF32, Boeings 737 Max, and more\r\n- failures and avoiding failures in production at Google, including how automation can go wrong\r\n- why mkdir -p 0755 /path/to/dir can take you down hard\r\n- you know binary drivers suck, but do you need more examples? If so, come on by\r\n- why this temporary fix will bite you hard soon after\r\n- a problem is not actually fixed until it's root caused\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
