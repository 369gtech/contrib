description: "From OSCON 2015 in Amsterdam: The web has grown to become a hugely important medium, but it has also become horrendously complex, which extends development schedules and promotes bug formation. The standards process cannot reduce the web’s complexity; it can only increase it. Making things worse, there are security vulnerabilities in the web that have been present since its creation, which become increasingly dangerous with time.\n\nThis talk introduces Seif, an open source project that was started at PayPal, which has the goal of transitioning the web into an application delivery system that will be safer, easier to use, and easier to develop for.\n\nThis keynote is sponsored by PayPal.\nAbout Douglas Crockford (PayPal):\nDouglas Crockford is best known for having discovered that there are good parts in JavaScript – an important and unexpected discovery.\n\nHe also discovered the JSON Data Interchange Format, the world’s best loved data format, and various JavaScript tools, such as JSLint.\n\nWatch more from OSCON Amsterdam 2015: https://goo.gl/VeF8tq\nVisit the OSCON website: http://oscon.com\nDon't miss an upload!
