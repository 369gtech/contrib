description: "The arrival of Google Glass is just around the corner (that lucky someone in your office might already have one). Are you ready to start programming for it? Well, it might not be as difficult as you thought, you might already have the tools to do it! \n\nThis presentation covers a series of examples that demonstrate how you can use CSS3, in conjunction with a little Javascript and jQuery, to create hybrid HTML5 applications that are deployable on Android and Google Glass. Oswald Campesato, author of HTML5 Canvas and CSS3 Graphics Primer, stopped by SFAndroid to walk us through this process.\n\n**More free resources about programming for Android: http://marakana.com/s/tags/android"
