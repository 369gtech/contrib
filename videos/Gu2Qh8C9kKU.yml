description: "Liberate Your CloudFoundry Installation From Being Constrained to a Single Cloud - Marcel Härry, Swisscom\n\nCloud Infrastructure components are here to fail, while your service – in our case cloud foundry as a platform running your workload – is here to stay available and keep the hosted applications alive. How do you stay available, while whole clouds are going down, either for maintenance or due to failure? \n\nAt Swisscom we think that cloud infrastructure should be kept as simple as possible, meaning that it is here to deliver a platform that enables rapid deployment of cloud-native workload, without lots of complexity. \n\nIn the end users would like that the platform to deploy and run their applications should stay alive and keep running their applications without interruptions. \n\nTo keep that promise while having individual parts (in our case whole stacks) failing, we didn’t delegate this problem to the infrastructure, but rather took it to the application level, meaning Cloud Foundry.\n\nAbout Marcel Härry\nLeading the architecture of Swisscom's elastic platform going from cloud infrastructure based on OpenStack up to a Platform as a Service running on CloudFoundry. Background in software engineering, but long time and mainly fixing and deploying stuff as a systems engineer and automation advocate."
