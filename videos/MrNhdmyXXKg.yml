description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nHow the OOM-Killer Deleted My Namespace, and Other Kubernetes Tales - Laurent Bernaille, Datadog \n\nRunning Kubernetes at scale is challenging and you can often end up in situations where you have to debug complex and unexpected issues. This requires understanding in detail how the different components work and interact with each other. Over the last 3 years, Datadog migrated most of its workloads to Kubernetes and now manages dozens of clusters consisting of thousands of nodes each. During this journey, engineers have debugged complex issues with root causes that were sometimes very surprising. In this talk Laurent and Tabitha will share some of these stories, including a favorite: how a complex interaction between familiar Kubernetes components allowed an OOM-killer invocation to trigger the deletion of a namespace. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ekDO"
