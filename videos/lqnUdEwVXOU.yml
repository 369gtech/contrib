description: "All those Azure demos look great, get up and running in seconds, never leaving the comfort of your IDE! But real life is more complicated. We have a mix of VMs, databases, web sites, and of course someone is playing around with microservices and App Fabric. Deploying from Visual Studio was easy at first, but now carpal tunnel is setting in.\n\nThere are better ways! In this session, we'll take a complex Azure deployment and introduce automated builds, packaging, deployments, an entire continuous delivery pipeline. We'll also look at Azure Resource Manager, converting our topology to infrastructure-as-code, providing even greater insight and control over our deployments. Finally, we'll look at more exotic deployment scenarios such as blue-green deployments and feature flags for a first-class deployment experience."
