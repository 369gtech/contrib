description: "DOES19 Las Vegas â€” In a year long collaboration with Gene Kim and Dr. Stephen Magill, we objectively examined and empirically documented software release patterns and cybersecurity hygiene practices across 54,000 commercial development teams and open source projects. \n \nIn this session, we will present evidence on the outcomes of that research, highlighting organizational and technology practices that enable exemplar open source teams to deliver 50% more commits, release new code 2.4x faster, and remediate security vulnerabilities 2.9x faster, all while delivering a level of value that makes them standouts in terms of popularity and adoption.\n\nDOES19 Las Vegas\nDOES 2019 US\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
