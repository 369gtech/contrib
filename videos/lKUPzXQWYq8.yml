description: "So you are working as developer or DevOp in a company and you have to work with a co-worker with autism? Or worse, you are a leader or team leader with autistic workers? No problem! People with autism aren’t that hard to handle, there are worse problems, like people who doesn’t understand autism. To work with people with autism there’s an auti-manual. If you discovered the manual then you can get the most of them! People with autism are by example to the point, and have are hard workers! And who will learn you the manual? Of course a developer with autism, who else can do it better?\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
