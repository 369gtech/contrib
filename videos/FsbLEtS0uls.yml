language: English
recordingDate: 1368751165
description: "Andrew Lookingbill, Michael Weiss-Malik \n\nIn 2008, Google began project Ground Truth. Its goal was to map the world from authoritative data sources, via a unique mix of algorithms and elbow grease. To date, the project has created and launched high-quality map data of 42 countries in Google Maps. In this session, you'll get a behind-the-scenes look at the inner workings of Ground Truth. Come see how we combine a mix of advanced algorithms, supplemental data (such as aerial and Street View imagery), as well as raw human labor to create and maintain map data that corresponds as closely as possible to real-world truth on the ground.\n\nFor all I/O 2013 sessions, go to https://developers.google.com/live"
