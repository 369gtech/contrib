description: "Google Tech Talks\r\nJanuary, 31 2008\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nAdvancing toward your dreams and goals is an essential part of personal satisfaction, leadership and career development, transitioning to a new role/location, performance improvement, and dealing with crises. This fast-paced, hands-on session will cover a variety of unique and fun exercises and practices. \r\n\r\nYou will learn the importance of life balance and ways of defining and personalizing it for you; the importance of balancing short, medium, and long-term dreams and goal achievement; how to make your dreams a tangible part of your everyday life and surroundings; how to strengthen your powers of visualization; and how to build on relationships and networking to help make dreams a reality. \r\n\r\nExamples of specific exercises include dream affirmations, dream storyboarding, personal pep-talks, forgiving yourself, mining your accomplishments, cultivating a gratitude attitude, and living from greatness. \r\n\r\nThese techniques can be used either with a coach or by yourself. Just as a fitness trainer helps you advance toward your physical dreams and goals, this session helps you advance toward your professional and personal dreams and goals. Google offers you generous one-on-one coaching and other coaching services, and you and your coach can apply techniques from this session that work best for you to meet your individual needs and style. \r\n\r\nSpeaker: Michael Beasley\r\nMichael Beasley, Ph.D., works with directors, managers and individual contributors. He thinks of his clients as \"super heroes\" and like all \"super heroes\" (think Spiderman) most people occasionally get stuck, sometimes seeking that next lifeline even though they may be high functioning employees. Backed by experience in computer, software, Internet, engineering, large-scale construction, consumer industries, and higher education, including management positions at Hewlett-Packard and Director of the Executive MBA Program and Associate Professor at Golden Gate University, he enables professionals to define goals and achieve results. He has a proven track record in the corporate setting for developing leaders and team players through coaching, consulting and education."
