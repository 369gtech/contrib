description: "RSA is widespread on the Internet, and uses large prime numbers - but how does it work? Dr Tim Muller takes us through the details.\n\nApologies for the poor audio quality of this video which is due to the remote nature in which it was recorded.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/computerphile\r\nhttps://twitter.com/computer_phile\r\n\r\nThis video was filmed and edited by Sean Riley.\r\n\r\nComputer Science at the University of Nottingham: https://bit.ly/nottscomputer\r\n\r\nComputerphile is a sister project to Brady Haran's Numberphile.
