title: 'RVMS â€“ a practical reactive architecture for Flutter Apps, Thomas Burkhart'
language: English
recordingDate: 1607623525
description: "Currently there is little guidance on how to structure a Flutter app. RVMS gives a clear answer on how to do state management and cleanly structure an app. Instead of over-engineering, RVMS takes a practical approach on architecture.\n\nIn my talk I will introduce you to the key concepts of RVMS and why it is a good fit for the reactive nature of Flutter.\n\nFor everyone wondering how to structure their App or looking for an fully command based state management solution that doesn't rely on InheritedWidgets, this is the talk for you."
