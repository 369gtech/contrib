description: "The DOM hasn't been known for its sense of design or ergonomics, since, well, ever. In this talk I've cover a handful of browser DOM APIs that can get pretty weird.\n\nWe'll learn about some of the warts of the web platform, why we're mostly stuck with them, and ideally how we can learn from their mistakes.\n\nCome get weird with the Fullscreen API, DOM Events, Indexed DB, showModalDialog, CSSStyleDeclaration, Canvas, WebRTC APIs... and more!\n\nSlides: https://miketaylr.com/pres/browser-api-day/\nAbout Mike: https://twitter.com/miketaylr\n\nMore about CSS Day: http://cssday.nl or https://twitter.com/cssdayconf\nReceive conference announcements in your inbox: http://cssday.nl/subscribe"
