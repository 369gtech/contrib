description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nSponsored Session: Datadog - Policy-as-code for Kubernetes with Gatekeeper\n\nSpeakers: Ara Pulido\n\nAs more enterprises migrate to cloud native environments like Kubernetes, the need for scalable ways to define and enforce fine-grained policies increases: how can I limit the number of replicas of a pod for certain users? how can I ensure that all images come from trusted registries?\n\nGatekeeper is an open source project to integrate Open Policy Agent (OPA) in Kubernetes environments. Gatekeeper allows to define policy as Kubernetes objects, making it easier to adopt policy-as-code practices in Kubernetes environments and sharing reusable policy templates.\n\nIn this demo we will explain how to set up Gatekeeper for Kubernetes environments. You’ll learn how to adopt policy-as-code techniques and how you can integrate Gatekeeper with your existing tools."
