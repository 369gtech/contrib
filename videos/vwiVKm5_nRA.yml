description: "Machine learning algorithms often take center stage in machine learning and AI. However, in the real world, 90% of the time spent building models goes into creating the mythical perfect numeric matrix of features, to feed into the chosen algorithm. Every machine learning team repeats the same effort, reinventing the wheel once again.\n\nIn this session, Leah McGuire and Mayukh Bhaowal talk about transmogrification, where they magically and automatically engineer features based on the type of feature, data distribution and association with the response variable.\n\nLeah McGuire is a Principal Member of Technical Staff at Salesforce, working on automating as many of the steps involved in machine learning as possible. Mayukh Bhaowal is a Director of Product Management at Salesforce Einstein, working on automated machine learning. \n\nThis video was recorded at QCon.ai 2018: https://bit.ly/2piRtLl \n\nThe next QCon is in New York, June 25-29, 2018.
