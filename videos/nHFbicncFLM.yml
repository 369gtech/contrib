recordingDate: 1311722679
description: "Tim is a promoter, interlocutor and sometimes skeptic of all things NOSQL.\n\nHe created a global, ephemeral network of user groups called a NOSQL Summer (936 participants in 38 cities from 20 counties) and recently finished filming the NOSQL Tapes, a series of conversations with the community on the various meanings of the trend.\n\nIn previous lives, he worked on so-called \"Big Data\" problems at the University of Maryland and at the NASDAQ Stock Exchange. He now works for a Data Hosting & Analytics company named Cloudant and occasionally moonlights as an unreliable narrator."
