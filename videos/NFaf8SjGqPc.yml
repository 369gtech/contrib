recordingDate: 1625029467
description: "In this live stream we will go over a step by step process on how to install a Cloud Foundry PaaS on your Azure Kubernetes Clusters. Once installed you will have access to a PaaS that will greatly simplify application deployments to Kubernetes.\n\nCloud Foundry provides a highly efficient, modern model for cloud native application delivery on top of Kubernetes. Cloud Foundry makes going from code to running apps as easy as a single cf push command. Don’t spend developer’s time writing YAML, instead allow developers to stay focused on code."
