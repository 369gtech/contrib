description: "Rook, Ceph, and ARM: A Caffeinated Tutorial - Federico Lucifredi & Sébastien Han, Red Hat \n\nWe picked a single-board computer with a dual-core ARM cortex A-53 and 2GB of RAM, put eight of them together, and built a low-power Ceph cluster not much bigger than the hard drives themselves.     Sounds interesting? Come see us do it live right in front of you! After we review the design choices and architecture of the cluster, we will use it to showcase the use of Rook, the CNCF's incubation project designed to be a cloud-native storage orchestrator for Kubernetes, turning storage technologies into a service completely transparent to the user.     A comprehensive examination of uses and open problems will complement our review of Rook's architecture. We will deep-dive into what it does well, what it does not do (yet), and what are the operational trade-offs of using a storage operator. With live access to a running cluster, we will showcase Rook in action as we discuss its capabilities. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPfn"
