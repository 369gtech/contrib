language: English
recordingDate: 1582234634
description: 'As a community, we are all building up the know-how on how to run Kubernetes. At its heart, Kubernetes is an infrastructure platform for container orchestration. We need to do more for application developers building distributed microservices on Kubernetes. In this session, you will get a better understanding of the Open Application Model which is an open source specification that allows developers and application operators to describe their apps and itâ€™s needs instead of dealing with the complexities of infrastructure. We will look at the problems this project is attempting to solve, how it approaches it and how it leverages and work with existing projects to solve the problems.'
