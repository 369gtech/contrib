description: "Check out the latest from The Lead Developer at theleaddeveloper.com\n \nItâ€™s easy to forget what it felt like when you were a beginner.

It includes several practical suggestions of how to help and convince less agile-experienced colleagues.\n\nBased on my experience as a consultant technical lead, the aim is to help you to move your team members to a state of childlike fearlessness where learning is fun; is embedded in everything you do; and applies to all team members regardless of experience.\n\n*It turns out that images of dogs can be used to illustrate an astonishing variety of concepts!"
