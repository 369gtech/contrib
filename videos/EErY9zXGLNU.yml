description: "This talk is about “scaling yourself” and what I learned after the #100DaysOfCode challenge. I will present some helpful tips about self-motivation, time-management, stop procrastination, setting priorities, staying organized, believing in yourself and keeping a balance between your career and personal life. I'm going to present my personal examples of coding/studying every single day for the past 1,5 years, what I gained and how I achieved my goals. We are going to explore ways of finding mentors, friends and expanding your social network. This talk is not only about getting better at your 9 to 5 job but also about developing yourself.\n\nTalk by Eleftheria Batsou at Codegarden.\n\n?Eleftheria on Twitter: https://twitter.com/BatsouElef\n?
