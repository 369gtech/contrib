recordingDate: 1506671207
description: "Deep learning has been in the news a lot lately, but in most cases the articles are hyperbolic and don’t represent the technology well. This introduction will give you a better understanding of what deep learning can and can not do for you, and we will even build a simple network using Keras. If you always wanted to know what’s deep learning beyond the hype, but you were worried that it will involve too much math, this talk is for you.\n\nDevConf 2017 (http://devconf.pl)\n13-15 September 2017"
