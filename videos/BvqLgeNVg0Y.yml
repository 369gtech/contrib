description: "PyData DC 2018\n\nMany of the most important problems a data scientist faces day-to-day are software engineering problem. Among them are the challenge of ensuring the right code runs in the right place at the right time. I discuss the importance of having solutions to this challenge and some possible implementations.\n\nSlides - https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CUfrWaET5cepR9KUXHMe9ChbenEaRAS-9KNyTxAb_HM\n===\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
