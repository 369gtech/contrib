description: "In this Deep Dive, we take a look at all aspects of developing software for your Azure Sphere device. Check out the Azure Sphere docs, dev kits, and samples: https://aka.ms/AzureSphereDocs We will beginning with an Azure Sphere dev kit and the Azure Sphere SDK, we'll get your first app built, deployed and debugged in Visual Studio Code. We'll then dig into various unique aspects of the Azure Sphere platform: the app manifest, the device capability file, the application runtime APIs, the cloud deployment model, and the difference between high-level apps vs real-time capable apps.\n\nGuest Speakers:  Richard Taylor - Azure Sphere Principal PM Lead\n\nDeep Dive Host: Pamela Cortez - Azure IoT Senior PM\n\nDeep Dives are interactive training live events for developers, architects, or anyone building IoT solutions.
