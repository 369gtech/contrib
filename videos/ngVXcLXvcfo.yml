description: "Deep Dive: Rook - Jared Watts & Bassam Tabbara, Upbound \n\nIn this talk, we will be taking a deep-dive through both the architecture and some of the more recent developments of the Rook project. Rook is an open source cloud-native storage orchestrator for Kubernetes, providing the platform, framework, and support for a diverse set of storage solutions to natively integrate with cloud-native environments. We will learn in more depth about the recently added support for new storage providers, such as Cassandra and EdgeFS. We will also explore how Rook can implement new abstractions of storage to enable dynamic provisioning of more persistent resources in your applications, making them more portable and able to deploy consistently no matter what the environment is. Rook was accepted as the first storage project hosted by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation in January 2018. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPk3"
