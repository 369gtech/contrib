title: 'Make your mouse move like a human - modern AI directly in web browser - Jakub Ledworowski'

description: "Modern websites are protected from extensive bot activity by embedding monitoring mechanisms that should be invisible for humans but filter out bots. These monitoring countermeasures use machine learning techniques based on mouse movements while the user is going through website content, forms, buttons etc. So, it seems natural to also use artificial intelligence to trick these countermeasures. This presentation is going to be exactly about trying to implement a simple AI system using TensorFlow.js to move a mouse like a human.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks at: \nhttps://ndcsydney.com\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/"
