description: "Google TechTalks\nMarch 23, 2006\n\nRaj Reddy\n\nABSTRACT\nJaime Carbonell stated, about 10 years ago, that the mission for the Language Technology Institute at CMU is the research agenda implied by \"getting the right information, to the right people, at the right time, on the right medium, in the right language and with the right level of detail\". In spite of major contributions from Google and others, we are not close to achieving the bill of rights of information society. This talk will provide a forum for discussion on the research agenda necessary for fulfilling this vision."
