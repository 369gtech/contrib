description: "Over the years we have learnt the hard way that there are a lot of important aspects in software development initiatives. Project management, user experience and operational details are examples of such aspects. They are necessary. However, they are not sufficient.\n\nIn this presentation, Jimmy will discuss what really matters. Domain-Driven Design is very important to him, so it should come as no surprise that he believes deep collaboration with the domain experts to be one of the most important things to do and master. He'll delve into this in ways you probably haven't tried yet. Furthermore, he will discuss five other musts for reaching excellency.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks, courses, and conferences in the following links:\nhttps://ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
