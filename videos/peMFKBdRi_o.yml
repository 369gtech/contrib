description: "Beyond 1000 BOSH Deployments - Sven Schmidt, anynines \n\nHow do you operate over 1,200 deployments on a single BOSH Director? In the past many talks have had the Topic of Cloud Foundry at scale. But how about the underlying automation layer? BOSH has its own set of challenges and limits for running VMs and Deployments at scale. Learn which obstacles and limits came up and how we solved them with the help of the BOSH core development team. Learn how we monitor the directors, be it via logging and metrics or performance indicators.
