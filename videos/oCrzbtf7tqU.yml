title: 'YOW! 2014 Jez Humble - The Lean Enterprise'
recordingDate: 1514470242
description: "Companies like Amazon, Google and Netflix have shown that software can provide a powerful competitive advantage to organizations experimenting with disruptive business models. However in more traditional organizations, where IT is “just a department”, it’s easy to be cynical about the transformative power of software development. The main barriers are cultural and architectural – and of course, these concerns are linked.\n\nThis talk will begin by presenting the principles that enable rapid software-driven innovation at scale. We will then spend the bulk of the talk discussing how to transform existing organizations, using case studies from several domains. By the end, you will be equipped with battle-tested approaches to better serve customers by harnessing your organization’s true competitive advantage – the ingenuity of its employees.\n\nJez Humble is a vice president at Chef, and co-author of the Jolt Award-winning Continuous Delivery, published in Martin Fowler’s Signature Series (Addison Wesley, 2010), and the forthcoming Lean Enterprise, in Eric Ries’ Lean series. He has been fascinated by computers and electronics since getting his first ZX Spectrum aged 11, and spent several years hacking on Acorn machines in 6502 and ARM assembler and BASIC until he was old enough to get a proper job. He got into IT in 2000, just in time for the dot-com bust. Since then he has worked as a developer, system administrator, trainer, consultant, manager, and speaker.\n\nHe has worked with a variety of platforms and technologies, consulting for non-profits, telecoms, financial services and on-line retail companies. From 2004 – 2014, he worked for ThoughtWorks and ThoughtWorks Studios in Beijing, Bangalore, London and San Francisco. He holds a BA in Physics and Philosophy from Oxford University and an MMus in Ethnomusicology from the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London.\n\nHe is presently working for Chef and living in the San Francisco Bay Area with his wife and daughters.\n\nFor more on YOW!
