description: "JavaScript keeps on expanding. As adoption of the extensive new features from ES6 has spread and projects have adapted, the language has continued to evolve under the guidance of Ecma TC39. Over the past two years, another handful of constructs entered the ECMAScript specification. And there are nearly two dozen more proposals on the cusp of being added.\nOne thing is certain: the JavaScript community is not slowing down! How can we determine when it is “safe” to use a new feature? Investigate the new and proposed features of JavaScript. Understand the TC39 review process. And most of all, become empowered to prepare for what lies ahead.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcsydney.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
