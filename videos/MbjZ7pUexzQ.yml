Where should a team get started on their service orchestration journey? How do they ensure this choice can benefit the team’s use case for years to come? David Schainker will facilitate a panel bringing the expertise of Jani Leppanen, Verónica López, Thomas Depierre, and Brian Hunt with the goal of bringing clarity to the fog of such decision making.\n\nOur panelists will discuss their orchestration technology of choice and why it matters to them. We’ll hear about how to learn the ropes, how these technologies boost developer efficiency, how to staff the team to use this technology, and how to get management on board with leveraging newfound efficiencies.\n\n• Follow us on social: \n  Website: https://codesync.global/conferences/code-mesh-ldn/\n  Twitter: https://twitter.com/CodeMeshIO\n\n• Looking for a unique learning experience?\n  Attend the next Code Sync conference near you! \n  See what's coming up at: https://codesync.global \n\n• SUBSCRIBE TO OUR CHANNEL\n  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC47eUBNO8KBH_V8AfowOWOw"
