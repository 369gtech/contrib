description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nDiscussion & Comments: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2019\n—\nAmid an avalanche of packaging solutions, who's side should you take? Trick question; you can support all of them! Discover the fundamental principles that make your library easy for _others_ to package so you don't have to! As a bonus, your builds will be faster, simpler, and more maintainable.\n\nThis talk covers the lessons learned from packaging 1,000 libraries in vcpkg, from the simplest single-header to the massive framework of Qt. We'll dissect the open source package maintainer's perspective and walk through the top library mistakes, supported by real-world examples from the vcpkg catalog.\n\nThis is a spiritual successor of the 2018 Cppcon lecture of a similar name, with all new material and direct examples of \"What To Do\" to complement the avalanche of \"What Not To Do\". It does not require knowledge of the previous talk and is instead complementary.\n— \nRobert Schumacher\nSoftware Developer, Microsoft\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
