title: 'Should You Rewrite In Rust?'
language: English
recordingDate: 1519602231
description: "When coders hear about a promising programming language, they often think \"I'd like to write something in that!\" While rewriting an existing utility or codebase in a new language can sometimes be a good idea, there are many situations in which it's not -- and to make it even more difficult, the benefits and drawbacks of a rewrite vary greatly based on which languages you're using!\n\nCome to this talk to learn about the various techniques you can use to integrate Rust with existing code in other languages, their pros and cons, and who's using them in the industry. Even if you haven't tried Rust yet, you'll get a crash course in its strengths, its weaknesses, and the many ways you can make it do cool stuff.\n\nEVENT:\n\nThis talk was given at Linux.conf.au 2018 (LCA2018) which was held on 22-26 January 2018 in Sydney Australia.\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nE.
