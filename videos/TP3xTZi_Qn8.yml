description: "Domain-Driven Design Europe 2018\nhttps://dddeurope.com/\nhttps://twitter.com/ddd_eu\nDistilling Your Design Heuristics: A Report and a Challenge\nOver time, we build up a personal toolkit of design heuristics. I’m been designing software for many years and I’ve seen many alternative design solution solutions that work, so I am hesitant to say any one is “best.” Yet I have my own style and distinct design preferences I have accumulated over years of experience. You do as well. This talk will share a few design and modeling heuristics that were distilled during our pre-conference workshop and reflect on the difference between what works in theory and what we see in practice. And it will challenge you to grow as a designer by becoming more aware of your personal design heuristics and how they are shaped and evolve. You can grow as a designer by examining and reflecting on the decisions you make and their impacts, becoming more aware of seemingly minor decisions that were more important than you thought, and putting your own spin on the advice of experts.\n\nBIOGRAPHY\n\nRebecca is an object design pioneer who invented the set of design practices known as Responsibility-Driven Design (RDD) and by accident started the x-Driven Design meme. Along the way she authored two popular object design books that are still in print. She was the design columnist for IEEE Software. You can find her design columns, papers, and writing at www.wirfs-brock.com/Resources.html.\n\nIn her work, Rebecca’s helps teams hone their design and architecture skills, manage and reduce technical debt, refactor their code, and address architecture risks. In addition to coaching and personal mentoring, she teaches and conducts workshops on Responsibility-Driven Design, Pragmatic TDD, enterprise application design, agile design skills and thinking, being agile about system qualities, and Agile Architecture. In her spare time she jogs (even in the rain).\n\nRebecca is also program director of the Agile Alliance’s Experience Report Initiative. Another interest of hers is software patterns. She serves on the Board of the Hillside Group and recently has written an essay about the relationship between patterns and heuristics, patterns about how to create and manage magic backlogs, sustainable architecture, agile QA, and adaptive systems architectures. If you are interested in writing about your experiences or sharing your wisdom in pattern form, contact Rebecca. She can help you turn your itch for writing into the written word."
