description: "Building Security In: Using Cloud Foundry to Secure CF Apps - Guy Podjarny, Snyk\n\nSecurity is a hot topic in Cloud Foundry world, but most CF security conversations revolve around the platform itself – from updating Stemcells to blocking SSH access. What about securing the apps that run on top of CF? \n\nThis talk focuses on how you can use Cloud Foundry to build central controls that enforce application security practices on CF apps, resolve issues automatically, and make security controls easy and accessible to apps, allowing them to do the right thing. Investing in such security mechanisms can help prevent problems before they reach production, and continue saving your developers precious time. \n\nGuy will show how the right use of buildpacks, services and external APIs can help handle secret management and rotation, managing vulnerable libraries, encryption handling and more.\n\nAbout Guy Podjarny\nGuy Podjarny (@guypod) is a cofounder at Snyk.io, focusing on securing open source code. Guy was previously CTO at Akamai following their acquisition of his startup, Blaze.io, and worked on the first web app firewall & security code analyzer. Guy is a frequent conference speaker, the author of \"Responsive & Fast”, “High Performance Images” and the upcoming “Securing Open Source Libraries”."
