description: "The gig economy has been transforming and disrupting industries. Globalization continues to erase borders. The language barrier gets thinner with every new generation. The work that can be done remotely will be done remotely. \n\nIf you didnâ€™t believe it before COVID, you surely believe it now. At EPAM, we started exploring the concept of Anywhere a few years back but there has not been a better year than 2020 to double down on remote and on-demand workforce. \n\nAnywhere is an ecosystem of apps, services, APIs, and experiences that support a rapid business transformation towards a diversified workforce without borders through unprecedented times. \n\nIn this talk, I will explain why we believe in Anywhere and how we make Anywhere possible. It started as a traditionally architected monolith. A copy of a copy of a system that used to be centered around internal employment opportunities. \n\nIn a few short months, we made a 180 degree turn to microservices, k8s, serverless, on-demand AWS services, continuous delivery, and more. \n\nAnywhere is now a collection of diverse experiences powered by a scalable API ecosystem ready to grow and evolve rapidly in multiple directions. I would like to show you how we engineered Anywhere, how we think in APIs, how we achieve speed with polyglot architecture and modern cloud services."
