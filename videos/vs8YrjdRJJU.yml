description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nSponsored Session: Google Cloud - Multi-cluster, Blue-green Traffic Splitting with the Gateway API\n\nSpeakers: Mark Church\n\nThe Gateway API is an open source SIG-Network project that is evolving the Kubernetes Ingress specification, making it a much more capable and role-oriented API. This demo will show how to use the Gateway API and its support for weights and HTTP header matching to shift multi-cluster ingress traffic across different Kubernetes clusters. This kind of traffic management enables much safer blue-green, multi-cluster deployments for less risk and more stability in multi-cluster environments."
