description: "The Transaction Script pattern organizes business logic as a single procedure. It has always been considered less sophisticated and flexible than a layered architecture with a rich domain model. But is that really true?\n\nIn this talk, we'll reinvent the Transaction Script using functional programming principles. We'll see that we can still do domain-driven design, and still have code which is decoupled and reusable, all while preserving the simplicity and productivity of the original one-script-per-workflow approach.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks, courses, and conferences in the following links:\nhttps://ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
