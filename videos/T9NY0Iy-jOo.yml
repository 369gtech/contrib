description: "Democratizing MySQL: From Cloud Managed to Kubernetes Managed - Sachin Manpathak, Platform9 & Flavius Mecea, Presslabs SRL \n\nPlatform9, like many startups used public cloud based MySQL service as backend to quickly get started. But as their customer base grew, the public cloud costs became significant. Their goal for this project was ambitious - they wanted to run their own MySQL as a service without any in-house MySQL expertise. They also wished the model to scale well, achievable with a small team.     Learn how Platform9 has reached their goal by using a highly flexible open-source MySQL Operator, written by Presslabsâ€”a startup that aims at democratizing the WordPress hosting infrastructure by using Kubernetes and other open technologies.     This is a back-to-back combo talk featuring 2 people who know the MySQL Operator better than anyone, but differently: the original builder & its heaviest user. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPYa"
