description: "Chris Withers\n\nWhat comes next after Django and it's Django REST Framework? This talk shows how to build a simple REST API for a database from the ground up using FastAPI.\n\nThe normal pattern for building a modern web application is a Javascript front-end application hitting a REST or GraphQL API back-end API. Django's DRF has been one of the standards for Python API servers but has the idiosyncrasies and drawbacks of Django, so what comes next?\n\nThis talk will go through the current available options, explaining why I settled on FastAPI. It will then go through the process of building a simple REST API from the ground up, explaining the choices available and covering url mapping, databases and authentication/authorization.\n\nTo get the most out of it, you will already know some Python. Experience with REST APIs and databases will help, but isn't required."
