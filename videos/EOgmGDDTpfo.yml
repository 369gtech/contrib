description: 'As developers, we always have to battle people and media overselling what we do. Just because we use things other people don''t understand doesn''t mean we use magic. Yet if you look at any "near future" video of cool technology everything is incredibly smooth. We, on the other hand, seem to be far too excited about things breaking and trying to find solutions for any problem - no matter how unlikely it is to happen. In this keynote Chris Heilmann wants to remind us about what we have, what we can do and just how amazing our work really is. And what we can do to keep it like that.'
