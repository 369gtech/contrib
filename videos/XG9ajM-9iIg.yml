description: "Objects With Functions \n\nBrice will be live-coding to create an object oriented language from scratch using only functions. This will be based on Paul Graham's On Lisp. He will show you the approach of using a small set of primitives and compose them into a DSL. You'll optionally be able to follow along and create your own version in your browser using a custom environment built for the talk. \n\nBrice Fernandes \n(@fractallambda)\n\nBrice fell in love with programming while studying another subject at university and never really looked back. He now organises the Cambridge Programmer's Study Group meeting other developers twice a week to study computer science. When he's not programming, you can also find Brice helping startup teams go further and faster at the University of Cambridge Judge Business School's own startup accelerator Accelerate Cambridge, where he is a coach and mentor. \n\nhttp://www.meetup.com/Norfolk-Developers-NorDev/events/222930589/"
