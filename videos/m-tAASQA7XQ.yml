description: "PyData Tel Aviv Lightning Talks #4\n23 August 2018\nSponsored and Hosted by Barrel Protocol\nhttps://www.meetup.com/PyData-Tel-Aviv/\n\nBeware of data leakage / Yonatan Hadar - Data leakage is a very common pitfall that many data science projects fall into that may appear in many different forms, some of which are incredibly hard to catch.\nThe effect of data leakage on the actual performance of production models and on the total effort spent on data modeling could be huge.\nIn this talk I will cover some best practices of discovering and avoiding data leakage with some real world examples from my experience.\n\nIntroducing the Hypernetwork: A Neural Network that Generates Weights for Another Neural Network / Lior Deutsch - Neural networks (NNs) are known to have many different optimal weight vectors. Where do these weight vectors lie in the \"weight space\"? Are they isolated from each other? This talk will discuss how to train a hypernetwork, which is a type of NN whose goal is to generate many different weight vectors for another NN. The hypernet can be used as a tool to probe the weight space, and it also has the practical applications of creating large ensembles of NNs, and improving robustness against adversarial examples.\n\nMulti-label classification - Methods & techniques / Alex Levin - In this lecture we will cover a various method and techniques to solve multi-label classification problems\n\nDetecting Obstacles: on the road and in your DL project / Noa Raindel - Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) alert the driver in case of any danger. An example for such danger is an obstacle on the road (such as another vehicle, pedestrian, traffic sign, etc.). The aim of my project was to quickly detect such obstacles. One approach is semantic segmentation, which requires many computations and is too slow to perform in real time. Thus, a solution was found in implementing and improving upon StixelNetâ€™s architecture.\nIn this short talk I will overview the challenge in question, the solution I developed, and some personal insights I gained while working on a first deep learning project.\n\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nFind a PyData chapter near you: meetup.com/pro/pydata"
