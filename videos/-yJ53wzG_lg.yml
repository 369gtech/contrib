description: "speaker: Josh Long \nhttp://twitter.com/starbuxman\n\nHi Spring fans! In this installment of Spring Tips we look at Spring Fu, the opinionated, function, reactive and Kotlin-first microframework from the Spring team.\n\nPlease note that Spring Fu is an experimental project that could end up by improvements and features contributed to existing Spring project (Framework, Boot, Data, Security)."
