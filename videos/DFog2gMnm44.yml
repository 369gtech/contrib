description: "Speaker(s):\nBoris Smus, Christian Plagemann, David  Coz\n\nDescription:\nFormerly titled: \"Field of view\"\n\nCardboard is a simple DIY enclosure that transforms a phone into a basic virtual reality headset and the accompanying open software toolkit. Cardboard makes it easy for both users and developers to experiment with VR. \n\nIn this session we discuss how to build immersive 3D experiences for Android. We give a deep dive into 3D side-by-side rendering, head tracking, and user interaction principles. We introduce a new open source VR toolkit and walk through using it to create a sample immersive app.\n\nWatch all Google I/O 2014 videos at: g.co/io14videos"
