description: "You got a working business model, scalable analytics infrastructure and highly skilled data scientists. But somehow you just don’t seem to be generating value from your data. Digital health and fitness company Runtastic shares their experience in translating business requirements into actionable data products that drive innovation. \r\nAfter scaling a capable analytics infrastructure and building skilled data science / engineering teams, Runtastic’s challenge was to apply these capabilities to it’s fast growing and ever-changing business. Business processes like user acquisition and customer relationship management had matured quickly and got more complex and sophisticated. Existing analytics and data products did not fit the business requirements any more and external solutions appeared both too expensive and limited. The solution was that data scientists took a step back from the data they knew to take a hard look on the business and how it works.  - Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/channel/JUMjvCF2ucj"
