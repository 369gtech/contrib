description: "Gil Goncalves \n\n\n\nMany developers will eventually make the choice of becoming a manager, the goal of this talk to help them make that decision.\n\nThis talk will be about helping people understand what the job of a manager is, make a decision on whether they should be managers, and that there are more ways to advance than just to become a manager.\nThis talk is aimed at developers of all levels, but this will be more interesting to those who are considering making a career change/are being promoted into a manager role or those who may look into becoming a manager in the future.\nMany developers will eventually make the choice of becoming a manager, the goal of this talk to help them make that decision."
