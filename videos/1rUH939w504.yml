description: "Ближайшая конференция — DotNext 2020 Moscow\n2-5 декабря, Online\nПодробности и билеты: https://dotnext-moscow.ru/\n\n. Ближайшая конференция — DotNext\_2020 Piter\n15-18 июня, Online\nПодробности и билеты: https://bit.ly/dotnext2020piter\n\n. When an application crashes once in a while, developers can try to reproduce the problem, use logs to figure out what happened, or analyze the crash dumps. Dissecting a crash dump can provide information on the exception that occurred, the state of the application threads, interesting memory objects, synchronization mechanisms, and a lot more. However, such manual analysis takes time and when your application crashes dozens of time a day, it’s not realistic to spend all of the developers’ time on analysis. A full automation would be perfect, or at the very least a triage of the crashes into groups: by component, type of crash, or any other criterion. In this session we will see how we can automate .NET crash analysis on both Windows and Linux, and how to perform more in-depth analysis (when necessary) using WinDbg, lldb, and SOS."
