title: 'Anita Singh - Styles, Themes, Material Theming, Oh My!'
recordingDate: 1555664208
description: "You want to style the title of dialogs throughout your app and you think it should be simple enough. However, once you dive into it, you might start asking questions - should I use alertDialogTheme or alertDialogStyle? Should I use dialogTitle, windowTitle or textAppearanceLarge? It is no secret that the styling and theming system in Android is complex, but I promise there is some method to the madness! We can avoid writing custom components just to achieve pixel perfection if we know how tame to the beast.\n\nIn this talk, we will learn about the difference between themes and styles, the hierarchy of different styling techniques and how to use them effectively. We will also learn how they work internally, and the best practices of how to apply them. We will wrap up by discussing the newest app theme in town - the Material Components Theme and the attributes that come with it, like “colorOnSurface”. \n\nAt the end of this talk, you will know how to style your app like a pro with the correct use of Styles, Themes, TextAppearance and sensible defaults while specifying colour, shape and typography through Material Theming."
