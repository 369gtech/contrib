description: "Speaker: Aditya Kedia, Associate Director â€“ Experience Design @ Manulife\n\nHow does the psychology of anticipation affect the experience?\nCan anticipating future help us create better design?\nWhat kind of digital future are you designing for?\n\nWe make hundreds of decisions every day that are guided by our past experiences and anticipation of the future. As our lives are becoming intertwined with ubiquitous technology, technology is increasingly influencing our perceptions, experiences, expectations and eventually the decisions we make.\n\nAnticipating future needs can help us imagine possibilities for a meaningful future and prepare for the future challenges to make better design decisions.\nWith emerging technologies, we can use, build and embed anticipation within the product or service experience life-cycle thus making them more contextual, human and resilient. We can therefore design experiences that are one step ahead and can positively influence the actions and outcomes to help solve present and future problems.\n\nHowever, we should also be aware of the potential pitfalls and ethical issues that may arise by misuse and abuse of the technology.\nThis session will explore the relationship between technology, data, emotions and\npsychology to predict and influence future behaviour and outcome and therefore, design more meaningful experiences.\n\nAbout the speaker\n\nAditya is an adept experience designer with over 12 years of experience in crafting experiences across physical and digital touch-points. He is humanising technology by using a data driven and customer centric design approach to transform the way customers consume products or services and create greater value for businesses. With hands-on experience in Research, Strategy and Design; Aditya manages the design process across product lifecycle.\nAditya is based in Hong Kong and has extensive experience working across 10 developed and emerging APAC markets. Aditya has also mentored, facilitated and organised numerous design workshops and jams and taught design at Hong Kong Polytechnic University.\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/akedia/\n\nEvent Page: https://uxsea.org/summit-2019\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG"
