description: "The hottest topic in computer science today is machine learning and deep neural networks. Many problems deemed \"impossible\" only 5 years ago have now been solved by deep learning: playing GO, recognising what is in an image, translating languages, ...\n\nSoftware engineers are eager to adopt these new technologies as soon as they come out of research labs and the goal of this session is to equip you to do so. Last year at Devoxx, we covered the basic principles behind neural networks. This year, we will focus on neural network architectures, dive into the most recent advances in the field and give you tips, engineering best practices and pointers to apply these techniques in your projects. No PhD required.\n\nThis session will cover the newest deep learning developments in image recognition and convolutional neural networks. Watching last year's recording beforehand (https://youtu.be/vq2nnJ4g6N0) is a good idea but all the necessary concepts will be reexplained.\n\n# Martin Görner\nMartin is passionate about science, technology, coding, algorithms and everything in between. He graduated from Mines Paris Tech, enjoyed his first engineering years in the computer architecture group of ST Microlectronics and then spent the next 11 years shaping the nascent eBook market, starting with the Mobipocket startup, which later became the software part of the Amazon Kindle and its mobile variants. He joined Google Developer Relations in 2011 and now focuses on parallel processing and machine learning ."
