description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2018\n—\nAfter introducing uniform initialization with C++11, there are at least 5 ways in C++ to initialize an object. \nEach have them has different rules, different effects, and different usage depending on the context and goals. \nThe situation is so confusing that today nobody can tell anymore which type of initialization to teach to beginners. \nThat's nothing but a disaster. \n\nThis talk will discuss the different forms of initialization, compare them to know when to use which, discuss what changed with C++14 and C++17 and what still has to change, and finally what to teach now to beginners. \nI promise a source of trouble and discussion.\n— \nNicolai Josuttis\nIT Communication\n\nNicolai Josuttis (http://www.josuttis.com) is an independent system architect, technical manager, author, and consultant.
