description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2018\n—\nWe will provide an introduction to the terminology connected with Undefined Behavior in C++. We will explore the differences between run time errors and undefined behavior. Our talk will focus on Undefined Behavior from the perspective of a developer rather than a compiler designer. As developers we may need to assume that all Undefined Behavior is treated as if the code was not present. Many talks focus on what current day compilers actually do. Our talk will talk about what an \"evil compiler\" is permitted to do. \n\nWe will talk about how to look in the C++ standard to learn what constitutes undefined behavior. \n\nMultiple examples will be provided to illustrate these ideas. \n\nFamiliarity with C++, no prior knowledge of compilers or undefined behavior is required.\n— \nBarbara Geller, CopperSpice\nCo-Founder\n\nI am an independent consultant with over twenty-five years of experience as a programmer and software developer. I have worked with numerous smaller companies developing in-house applications. I have also designed and developed Windows applications for several vertical markets including medical billing, transportation, and construction.\n\nMy degree is in Electrical Engineering from Cal Poly Pomona with additional studies in Computer Science.\n\nI am a Co-founder of CopperSpice, a C++ library derived from the existing Qt framework. I designed the Diamond Editor, a cross-platform programmers editor using the CopperSpice libraries. I have programmed in C++, Qt, Visual Objects, Clipper, PHP, and Java.\n\n\nAnsel Sermersheim, CopperSpice\nCo-founder\n\nI have been working as a programmer for nearly twenty years. My degree is in Computer Science from Cal Poly San Luis  Obispo. I have transitioned to independent consulting and I am currently working on a project for RealtyShares in San Francisco. \n\nCo-founder of CopperSpice, a C++ GUI library.\nCo-founder of DoxyPress, a C++ application for generating documentation. \nDeveloper of the open source libraries: libGuarded, CsSignal and CsString. \n\nI have programmed in C++, C, Lisp, Java, and Perl, with extensive knowledge in TCP/IP and mutilthreaded design. I am an  avid follower of the C++ standard. Speaker at CppCon 2015, CppNow 2016, CppNow 2017, and several ACCU Bay Area meetings.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
