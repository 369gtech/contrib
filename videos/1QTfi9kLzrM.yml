description: 'Even when Java code is more or less object-oriented, unit tests are in most cases purely procedural and script-like, which may be a problem for someone who is trying to be purely object-oriented. Itâ€™s a well-known fact that unit tests, in a properly maintained project, are longer and more complex than their production counterparts. If the entire code base is object-oriented, how can we make tests less procedural? At the presentation we will investigate which parts of test scripts may be made more object-oriented than they usually are and how will that improve their qualities, like maintainability, readability and extendability.'
