description: "RubyConf 2019 - Compacting Heaps in Ruby 2.7 by Aaron Patterson\n\nRuby 2.7 will feature a manual heap compactor integrated with the GC. In this presentation we'll cover how Ruby's memory is arranged, how compaction can be helpful to your application, as well as algorithms and implementation details of the heap compactor. As a bonus, we'll cover GC debugging techniques as well! This presentation is going to be heaps of fun. Don't turn the page because we're going to scan the stack for some great pointers!\n\n#confreaks #rubyconf2019"
