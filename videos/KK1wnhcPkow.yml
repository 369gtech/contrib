In this free hour-long webinar, Raja Rao, Cloud Foundry Developer Advocate, will explain what PaaS is and how it makes it easier for developers to build, deploy, run and scale applications.

Then, we''ll show you how to deploy a complex application on your laptop using Micro Cloud Foundry and scale to CloudFoundry.com without changing a single line of code.
