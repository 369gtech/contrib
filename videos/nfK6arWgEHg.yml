title: 'JDK IO 2018 - Dmitry Chuyko - Checksums that bite Java developers'

description: "Video recording of a presentation given at JDK IO conference in Copenhagen in June 2018 at the IT-University organized by the Danish Java User Group - Javagruppen.\n\nhttps://jdk.io/jdk-io-2018/speakers/210-dmitry-chuyko\n\nChecksums that bite Java developers\n\nSpeaker: Dmitry Chuyko\n\n\"CRC\", \"polynomial ring over a finite field\", \"intrinsics\". All this is designed to create strong visual images in the head of a Java developer. It turns out that the harmony of BigData can not live without algebra with identity and a good pinch of assembler code. This talk is more about the code.\n\nMany systems that we use \"out of the box\" are equipped with newly invented wheels, whose tasks can be performed by a standard library. Let's try to predict where you might encounter a checksum. Also let's discuss why you need it, and what to choose. And, of course, what is the performance and bottlenecks in checksum implementations, in particular, on x86 and ARM64.\n\nHere Java 9, 10 and Graal introduce some good optimizations that also begin to be used by other software."
