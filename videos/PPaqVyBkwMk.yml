language: English

description: "Deploying a website used to be tricky. Now with all of the built-in help, deploying your ASP.NET website to a local web server or the cloud can be done in minutes. Today, I am going to show you the options you have for deploying a full .NET website. We will cover deploying to a local or remote IIS server as well as Window Azure. Since .NET Core is a bit different, I will be covering the deployment options for it in a separate video. Not to worry though, the techniques in this video will also work for .NET Core. There are just more options available to it than there are to the full .NET Framework.\n\nFull courses: https://www.iamtimcorey.com/\nSource Code: https://leadmagnets.app/?Resource=WebsiteDeployment\nPatreon: https://patreon.com/IAmTimCorey\nNewsletter signup:  https://signup.iamtimcorey.com/"
