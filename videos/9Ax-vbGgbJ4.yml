Along with this trend companies are willing to move their new workloads onto Kubernetes. However, for most of the companies they still have a lot of legacy systems which cannot be migrated to kubernetes. Typically, there are already well-established monitoring solutions for these legacy systems. So there comes a challenge that how you can make sure kubernetes can be integrated seamlessly with the existed monitoring stack. In this presentation I will walk you through how we integrate kubernetes with our existed monitoring system and shows some best practices for it: for example, how to have a central dashboard for viewing the whole system status, how to maintain a uniform alerting mechanism, etc. I will also show you how we introduce prometheus into our existed monitoring stacks.\n\nTo learn more click here: https://sched.co/FuK4"
