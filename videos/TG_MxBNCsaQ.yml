description: "Git was designed with the command line in mind, but does that hold the application back? John Haley, Product Owner of Axosoft GitKraken and Hamid Shojaee, Founder of Axosoft, argue that the CLI can be complicated and confusing, with a steep learning curve even for developers. That’s why they’ve created a Git client that is not only beautiful and easy-to-use, but actually translates Git concepts into visually understandable processes.\n\nHamid Shojaee is addicted to the high of making great software. He is founder of two tech companies, Axosoft and Pure Chat, and has been a leader in the Arizona tech community for over 20 years.\n\nJohn Haley has been writing software for over 25 years and is currently Product Owner of Axosoft GitKraken. John loves bridging the two worlds of art and science in order to create software that, like a good piece of art, leaves the user feeling an emotional connection to it.\n\nAbout Git Merge:\nGit Merge is the pre-eminent Git-focused conference: a full-day offering technical content, user case studies and training workshops for Git users of all levels.\n\nVisit: http://git-merge.com/"
