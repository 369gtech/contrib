description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM SF 19 http://bit.ly/2T3Do0U\n\nGet involved in Code Sync's next conference http://bit.ly/2Mcm4aS\n\n---\n\nERLANG DISTRIBUTION VIA UDP COMBINED WITH ETHERNET TSN\nby Peer Stritzinger\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nEmbedded \nIndustrial \nIoT\n\nTALK LEVEL: Intermediate\n\n\nABSTRACT\nAfter some initial experiments we now are looking at using UDP for Erlang Distribution. Ethernet TSN (=Time Sensitive Networking) is a set of new standards that extends Ethernet by controlling latency and redundancy on Layer-2 making it possible to implement hard realtime reliable datagram service. \n\nRead the full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/peer-stritzinger/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - PEER STRITZINGER\nFOUNDING OWNER AND MANAGING DIRECTOR OF PEER STRITZINGER GMBH\n\nPeer ported Erlang to Hard-Realtime Operating system RTEMS (www.grisp.org). He developed the Hydraprog automotive control unit flashing device, which has been used successfully all over the world for over a decade. Since 2007 the firmware of the device is written mainly in Erlang - including protocol stacks for all existing automotive protocols. Peer is currently developing an industrial transport system controller with Erlang in a small embedded system.\n\nPeer's previous experience ranges from low-level device drivers to functional languages in industrial and automotive applications, he initially mastered in Physics at the Technical University Munich. He has been working self-employed as a developer since 1987 and also consulted in applied cryptography and protocol design and implementation.\n He is currently living and working in the idyllic countryside west of Munich, Bavaria.\n\nMore on Peer Stritzinger: https://codesync.global/speaker/peer-stritzinger/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM SF 19\nCode BEAM SF is powered by Code Sync. Code BEAM SF 19 was sponsored by WhatsApp, The RealReal, Brex, Erlang Solutions, 2600Hz, PagerDuty, and aeternity.\n\nCODE SYNC \nWebsite: www.codesync.global\nTwitter: www.twitter.com/CodeBEAMio\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/CodeSyncGlobal\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/code-sync/\nMail: info at codesync.global\n\n#Embedded #Industrial #IoT #Grisp"
