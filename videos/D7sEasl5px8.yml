description: "Eric Evans\nhttp://berlinbuzzwords.de/sessions/cassandra-example-data-modeling-cql3\n\nApache Cassandra is an increasingly popular choice of data store. Its write-optimized storage and shared-nothing distribution make it attractive for large, high-throughput data sets, or where availability and fault-tolerance are a concern. However, in spite of recent strides in usability, and rapidly maturing high-level interfaces, data modeling continues to be a source of confusion for many.\n\nWith the release of Cassandra 1.2 comes the 3rd iteration of the Cassandra Query Language, or CQL. CQL3 introduces improved support for wide rows through a novel use of compound columns; Per-row, normalized structures can now be stored, and efficiently queried using an SQL-like query syntax that should be second-nature to most developers.\n\nThis talk will take you step-by-step through a simple, open-source demo application modeled for Cassandra using CQL3, and provide the background needed to understand the model and query access.\nAbout the speaker: \nEric has more than a decade of experience in large-scale distributed systems, having held roles in both operations and engineering. An early employee of Rackspace, he implemented a global DNS infrastructure utilizing IP anycast (possibly the first), and a novel data-center-wide IDS for which a patent was awarded. An avid open source hacker, Eric is a developer with the Debian Project and a member of the Apache Cassandra PMC. He resides in Texas and works on distributed systems for The OpenNMS Group."
