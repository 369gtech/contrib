title: 'Onion architecture with stereotypes by Alain Sahli'
language: English
recordingDate: 1520853930
description: "The onion architecture is not as well known as the 3-tier architecture but is gaining a lot of attention during the microservices era. It structures your software so that it is easy to change technologies without impacting business logic. Coupled with DDD principles it offers a powerful way to build a clean and maintainable architecture. This kind of architecture is more and more important because technologies change much faster than business rules.\n\nIn this talk you will get an overview of the main concepts of an onion architecture. You will also learn how to ensure the onion architecture principles are followed by the developers using stereotypes and static code analysis tools. The talk will conclude with an example demonstrating how easy it is to switch technologies with a clean onion architecture in place.\n\nAlain Sahli is the executive director for technology at mimacom Switzerland. He's working for various customers as an architect and fosters the technologies used at mimacom. Alain is also a core committer of Spring Cloud AWS and founder of the Confluence publisher for publishing AsciiDoc to Confluence."
