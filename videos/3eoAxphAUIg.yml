description: "In this talk, Sébastien will share the latest status of the ongoing work performed by the Spring team to allow running Spring Boot applications as GraalVM native images for instant startup and low memory consumption.\n\nHe will talk about the out-of-the-box native image setup developed in the upcoming Spring Framework 5.3, demonstrate various Spring Boot applications running as native images and give an overview about how much of the JVM ecosystem is ready for such native runtime.\n\nThis will also be an opportunity for a pragmatic comparison between regular OpenJDK, GraalVM Community Edition and GraalVM Enterprise Edition with concrete figures."
