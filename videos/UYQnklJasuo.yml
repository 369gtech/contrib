description: "Stefan Oehme, Lead Developer, Gradle\n\nIMPROVING ANDROID BUILD PERFORMANCE\nIntermediate / Best Practices / Code Quality / Talk\n\nWe all know a fast build makes for a happy developer. Unfortunately, as your project grows larger and more complex, its build will become slower if left unchecked. You’ve updated to the latest Android Plugin, but you’re still waiting more than you like, what do you do? Recent Gradle releases give you new capabilities to greatly improve your build speed. This session discusses how you can : - Identify performance bottlenecks with build scans - Fix common problems, like slow configuration time, tasks running when they shouldn’t, and builds that don’t parallelize well. - Benefit from incremental annotation processing"
