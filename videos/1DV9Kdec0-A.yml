description: 'IOT has a massive potential and its impact in our daily life is important. Here is an exemple of using a connected object and analysing its data: we''ll see how to collect data using the accelerometer sensor of your smartphone. Then, we''ll store it in Cassandra as a Timeseries model. Finally, we''ll analyse those data and predict the activity with Spark. We will see a live demo on stage to show this solution working in realtime.'
