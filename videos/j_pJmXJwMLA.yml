description: "Whats the best way to get started with deep learning? Keras! It's a high level deep learning library that makes it really easy to write deep neural network models of all sorts. It can use several popular backends like Tensorflow and CNTK. I'll show you how it works and explain how it compares to the other deep learning libraries. \n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/keras_explained\n\nAlberto's Winning Code:\nhttps://github.com/alberduris/Reinforcement_Learning_AI_Video_Games/tree/master/Week%206\n\nSven's Runner-up Code:\nhttps://github.com/EmbersArc/PPO\n\nPlease Subscribe!
