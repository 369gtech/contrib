description: "Android Things lets you build professional, mass-market products on a trusted platform without previous knowledge of embedded systems.\nBut what does it take to get started with Android Things and be able to say you’re truly working with the Internet of Things? How can you learn this platform and get ahead of the IoT revolution using your existing Android skills?\n\nIn this session, we will explore what Android Things is and how you can get started building IoT applications with only some Android knowledge.\n\nWe will then build a real-life Android Things application using a Raspberry Pi 3 and Android Studio."
