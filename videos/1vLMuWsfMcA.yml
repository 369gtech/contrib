description: "Many developers have already wrapped their minds around the basic architecture and APIs of Kafka as a message queue and a streaming platform. But can they keep it running in production? This talk contains real-world troubleshooting and optimization scenarios culled from the logs of Confluent technical support.\nWe’ll talk about the trade-offs between optimizing for the always-desirable outcomes of throughput, latency, durability, and availability. How many partitions should you use for a given topic? How much message batching should you configure in the producer? How many replicas should be required to acknowledge a write? What do you do when you see a partition growing inexplicably? When should you rearchitect your application to use the streaming API? We’ll answer these questions and more int his overview of common Kafka production issues."
