description: "Microservices gave us fine-grained, replaceable components. Lambdas give us even finer event-driven functions. But both these paradigms have one common problem, handling data. One of the most interesting and provocative ideas to arise from the stream processing community is the use of streaming systems like Kafka as a source of truth that makes all types of data available to many stream processors.\n\nIn this talk weâ€™ll look at how events can be captured, streamed and processed on the cloud. We'll explore the relationship between event storage, stream processing and FaaS. Finally we'll see how we can best manage the stateful operations that are necessary in all real-world systems, whether they're based on microservices, functions or full-blown streaming systems.\n \nBen Stopford \nFrom Confluent\nBen is a technologist in the Office of CTO at Confluent Inc (a company backing the popular Apache Kafka messaging system). He has two decades of experience in the field and has focused on distributed data infrastructure for the latter half He's the author of the book \"Designing Event Driven Systems,\" O'Reilly, 2018.
