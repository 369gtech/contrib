description: "For over half a century, NASA has been building, launching, and operating space missions where failure is not an option. NASA's track record of success is due in part to the standards and practices of the mission development cycle that emphasize extensive planning and project risk mitigation through advance design. Though space missions can span over a decade and dozens of subsystems, the principles that have produced mission success can also be used to improve outcomes of small-scale software development projects. Specifically heritage review, trade studies, success metrics, requirement development and their traceability to success, and critical review can be readily applied to mitigate project risks and ensure product delivery on schedule and budget.\n\nThis talk summarizes how NASA flight projects are executed in the project and mission design phases, how these principles were applied in the development of Nanaya, a web app built in Django/Python/Postgres that uses mathematical modeling to predict the future of users' love and social lives, and the lessons that were learned in the process."
