language: English
recordingDate: 1342657866
description: "The responsiveness of Web and hybrid mobile apps is sometimes described as sluggish compared to native apps. Often, this is because the developer has bound event handlers to mouse events rather than touch events. By taking advantage of the touch events exposed by modern mobile devices, developers can potentially shave hundreds of milliseconds off of each user interaction, as well as enable gesture interactions that would not normally be available in an HTML context.\n\nWhat will be covered?\n\nOne-finger events\nTwo-finger events\nMulti-touch events\nGesture events\nWho is this webcast for?\n\nThis webcast is for front-end developers who are interested in creating web or hybrid mobile apps. Intermediate to advanced understanding of JavaScript is recommended.\n\nAbout Jonathan Stark\n\njstark@jonathanstark.com\nhttp://twitter.com/jonathanstark\n\nJonathan Stark is a mobile and web application consultant who the Wall Street Journal has called an expert on publishing desktop data to the web.\n\nHe has written two books on web application programming, is a tech editor for both php|architect and Advisor magazines, and is quoted in the media on internet and mobile lifestyle trends.\n\nJonathan began his programming career more than 20 years ago on a Tandy TRS-80 and still thinks Zork was a sweet game.\n\nProduced by: Yasmina Greco"
