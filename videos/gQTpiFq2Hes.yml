description: "Advanced Custom Search Configuration - Nick Weininger and Joel Brandt\r\n\r\nFor those who are attending Google I/O 2009(http://code.google.com/io/), these video are an opportunity to hear from some of the speakers in advance. The speakers introduce their topic and provide a preview of one or more topics that will be covered in their talks.\r\n\r\nhe focus of this session is on configuring your own Custom Search engine to let your users search the sites and topics that are relevant to you. We will discuss how to create dynamic search engines using Linked Custom Search and how to use XML to programmatically provision custom search engines. We will enumerate some of the ways in which you can embed search and ads on your site and customize the look and feel of the search results. Additionally, we'll talk about how Adobe Systems is integrating Google Custom Search Engines into products to improve designer and developer workflow."
