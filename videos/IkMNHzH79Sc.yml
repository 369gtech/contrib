recordingDate: 1493229752
description: "What makes a manager a leader? My name is Marina and I really want to share with you my story of reinventing myself through different team management experiences. Smart team management not only ensures the project goal achievement but also boosts the team members skills and helps to avoid a professional burn-out.\n\nFrom my point of view a team leader is successful only in case all the team members achieved their personal goals and ambitions while making a project together. What do I mean? I mean that if the project is delivered perfectly but at least one team member doesn't feel satisfied and fulfilled, it is a failure of the leader.\_\n\nThat was the thought I started digging from. And in every new team of mine I tried my best to implement all of my conclusions which I want to present to you.\n\nDuring the session I'll quickly revise\_the basics of team management with Tuckman's stages of team development. Don't worry, it won't be a boring theory. I'll provide you with real examples and focus on the leader's behavior in different situations.\_\n\nThen I'll move to\_the role of values in the process of managing a team. We'll talk about personal and project values, find an intersection in them and learn how to resent the team member's opportunities through their own values.\n\nOf course, speaking about values and whys I can't help telling about Simon Sinek's theory of a Golden Circle which contains\_the insight into why some leaders and organisations have achieved such an exceptional degree of influence. And I will build up on this a little to show how the leader can transmit this influence and inspire his/her team or company.\_\n\nIn the final part of my session I will present you\_the simplest coaching model\_that you can try to use even if you haven't had any experience in it. Because in the end of the day, it is all about personal talks."
