IoT has never been so loud and exciting.\n\nDuring this talk, the audience can control the drum machine with their smartphone, while they explore its design and execution in detail. What's in the box? What's in the cloud? How do they communicate? How do I make one myself?\n\nBecause that's the best part: you can build the whole thing yourself! The Internet of Drums is totally open source: from laser-cut case design to backend software. Instructions included, pull requests welcome.\n\nPiet van Dongen \nFrom Luminis\nPiet loves to dive deep into stuff. When he's done, he will explain it to you with great enthusiasm and humor. Even if the subject is super dry and boring. HTTP/2 internals? Piet breaks out his hacksaw. IoT architecture? Piet creates a drum computer the audience can play with from the comfort of their seats.\n\nWhy? Because he thinks it is essential that we share what we do and know. That's the best way to collectively get better at what we do."
