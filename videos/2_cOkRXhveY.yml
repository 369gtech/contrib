description: "Rust was voted “most loved” language by developers for the second year in a row in the Stack Overflow developer survey. There have been projects made using Rust on everything from operating systems to game engines for Minecraft-like games. Despite this, IDE support is still very limited.\n\nAs my Google Summer of Code project, I worked on a Rust plug-in for the KDevelop IDE which aimed to support most standard IDE features such as semantic highlighting, code completion, project management and debugging. I will go through the challenges of integrating language support in an existing IDE and talk about how adding semantic highlighting was one line of code and getting debugging to work took less than 10 minutes."
