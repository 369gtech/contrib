description: "In this keynote, Emily Davis and Neely Drake will tell you about a  champion. \n\nThis champion is not human. \n\nIt’s not even alive. This champion is a robot. It is not fluent in six million forms of communication, nor can it plot hyperspace jumps. It cannot do anything other robots in science fiction do. This champion’s name is Termite. Termite is the 11th robotic member of FRC (FIRST Robotics Competition) Team 2052 KnightKrawler. This robot has seen it all: two regionals, three off-season events, Carson subdivision, and the championship field. This session is about KnightKrawler's 2016 season with Termite, my first year."
