title: 'Building A React App With Java EE Backend'
recordingDate: 1475046911
description: "Java EE becomes an interesting platform for exposing services for mobile apps. To give you a feeling about the productivity, I installed a CORS filter, implemented, built and deployed a Java EE 7 service from scratch, exposed a JSON-array, implemented a HTTP client using stock XMLHttpRequest and rendered the result using the React JavaScript library.\n\nInterested in Angular 2, ReactJS or Java EE?
