description: "Original title: Building Better Products Faster: DevUx is the new DevOps\n\n“Front-end development has gotten trickier over the years. As new frameworks enable more complex behaviour, UX expectations have also risen. Yet, we still work the old way: Product defines features, designers make mock-ups, then developers integrate them. Side effects include: blocking dependencies, rework, misunderstanding, frustration, for everyone involved.\n\nIn this talk, we will provide you with a proven starter kit to improve all your future collaborations, among other things how to:\n\n- define the right process from the first concept of the feature to its design to its implementation on the app\n- define the perfect mock-up for painless design handoff\n- provide technical insights during the design process\n- involve the designer in your development process for a finishing touch\n\nJoin our movement and start growing a DevUx culture on your projects: build better, work faster, be happier!”\n\nWhat attracted Yu Ling to web development was being able to get visible results quickly. After an 8-month entrepreneurial adventure she joined Theodo to sharpen her CTO skills and build apps to grow businesses. Today, as a lead developer, she puts her energy on making her dreams of flawless Dev-Ux collaboration come true.\n\nFrance had always been wondering if there was a way to be both creative and analytic, to solve problems as well as think out of the box. And then, she found UX/UI design. Now, she is a lead designer at BAM where she has spread her passion for atomic design, typography, and building amazing products with the help of the devs on her teams."
