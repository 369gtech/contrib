Using delegates made it all easier for IncludeOS, the open source library operating system written from scratch in modern C++. Our header-only delegates are just as fast as C-style function pointers, compatible with std::function, and allows any object to delegate work to stateful member functions without knowing anything about the class they belong to. We use delegates for everything from routing packets to creating REST endpoints, and most importantly to tie the whole IP stack together. In this talk we’ll show you how we use delegates in IncludeOS, discuss pitfalls and alternatives, and give you all you need to get started.\n— \nAlfred Bratterud: IncludeOS, CTO\n\nAlfred Bratterud is the creator of IncludeOS, the C++ unikernel. The work on IncludeOS started as a PhD research project but has since evolved into a full time venture for the IncludeOS developer team. Alfred holds BSc and MSc in computer science from the University of Oslo, with focus on logic and computability. He has 10+ years of industrial programming experience.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
