description: "Did you ever had a colleague that said «Well, it’s simple. I just used a partial application on that curried function using higher order functions and closures» ? Did you understand anything ? If not, then that the workshop you are looking for.\n\nFunctional programming uses a lot of concepts that are familiar to mathematicians. And that’s scary ! But, applied to computing, it’s actually pretty simple !\n\nWhile live coding with you a refactoring that transforms a imperative code to a functional one, main concepts of functional programming will be introduced when necessary and explained deeply.\n\nAt the end of this talk, you will understand these key concepts :\n\n– Referential transparency\n\n– Functions as first class citizens\n\n– Higher order functions\n\n– Closures\n\n– Lambda calculus\n\n– Currying\n\n– Partial application\n\n– Function composition\n\n– «Point-free» notation"
