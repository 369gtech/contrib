title: 'Zero to Production with the Serverless Framework'
language: English
recordingDate: 1542219224
description: "Have you ever dreamt of getting an entire, functionality-rich service to production in a number of days? At Applied, we use the Serverless Framework to cut costs & deploy microservices with speed, efficiency and accuracy. This workshop will introduce you to the world of serverless (What, When & Why) and walk you through deploying your first production-ready application. It condenses specific lessons Diana has learnt from shipping full APIs in days; from 0 to production, and concepts scattered across numerous online resources.\n\nYou will not only walk away with a formidable understanding of how Serverless & cloud services like AWS Lambda work, but also a methodology to quickly solve everything you would worry about when building an app (code quality, testing, CD, authorisation, databases, etc), so you can truly focus on building business logic. Basic knowledge of NodeJS & CLI / Git required.\n\nEVENT:\n\nNode+JS Interactive 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nDiana Lee, BeApplied\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nThe Linux Foundation provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a_KROfYfEE"
