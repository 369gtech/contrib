description: "From the 2014 Velocity Conference in New York, Brian Bulkowski's keynote address, \"NoSQL Key Value Stores - The Key to Velocity\".\n\nWatch our interview with Brian: http://goo.gl/f1qc7F\n\nThe growth in interactive Internet and mobile applications is driving a new data challenge—velocity—where real-time responses are based on insights extracted from volumes of big data. In this 10-minute talk, Brian Bulkowski, Aerospike founder & CTO, will list reasons why in-memory and a new generation of distributed databases, NoSQL key-value stores, are the killer data solution for achieving velocity within every enterprise. He will look at the democratizing effect of open source in-memory NoSQL key-value stores that can achieve 1 million transactions per second, whether running on a single $5,000 server or on a single Amazon instance at a cost of $1.68 per hour. Additionally, he will share real-world examples of companies using these data technologies to scale from startups to industry leaders, including AppNexus, which was founded in 2007, recently earned a $1.2 billion valuation, and now manages 90 billion ad impressions per day.\n\nThis keynote is sponsored by Aerospike\n\nAbout Brian Bulkowski (Aerospike):\nBrian has 20-plus years experience designing, developing and tuning networking systems and high-performance Web-scale infrastructures. His career includes pioneering technical roles at Novell, Liberate and Aggregate Knowledge (now Neustar). He founded Aerospike after learning first hand, the scaling limitations of sharded MySQL systems and saw the need for a high performance database that would empower all developers, not just those at Internet giants that could afford to build their own. Brian has a B.S. degree in Mathematics and Computer Science from Brown University.\n\nWatch more from the 2014 Velocity New York Conference: http://goo.gl/kmrqJF\nFind out more about Velocity: http://velocityconf.com/\n\nDon't miss an upload!
