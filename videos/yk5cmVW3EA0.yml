description: "Many models give a lot more information during the inference process that we usually know. We will begin with an intrinsic estimation of all the distribution with random forest algorithm. Then we will extend those \"prediction intervals\" to almost every regression models thanks to the quantile loss. Eventually we will discuss about probability calibration to measure uncertainty in classification.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
