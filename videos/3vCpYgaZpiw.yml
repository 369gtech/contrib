description: "One line of code can get root access on many Linux systems. Dr Steve Bagley demos the exploit.\n\nMore info from The Register (updated link): https://bit.ly/2AAQnRT \n\nOn the subject of the 'censored' part, we fully appreciate that anyone can find out what that code is, but we're demoing & explaining it, not giving a resource for those who want to do it. If anyone wants to know the code simply look in the comments! hth -Sean \n\nSHA: Secure Hashing Algorithm  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMtFhACPnTY \nHardware Hacking: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOPLQxGNmHA \n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/computerphile\nhttps://twitter.com/computer_phile\n\nThis video was filmed and edited by Sean Riley.\n\nComputer Science at the University of Nottingham: https://bit.ly/nottscomputer\n\nComputerphile is a sister project to Brady Haran's Numberphile.
