description: "Saildrone designs, manufactures and operates a fleet of wind and solar-powered autonomous science vehicles which make cost-effective ocean data collection possible at scale. Our vehicles are capable of operating in exotic locales, in less than hospitable conditions, for long endurance missions. In this talk, we’ll discuss some of the challenges associated with monitoring drones at sea and the systems we’ve built to help operators keep tabs on the health of the fleet thousands of miles from shore over satellite communications.\n\n\nTodd Bealmear\nSaildrone\n@toddbealmear\n\n\nTodd Bealmear is the engineering manager of the Fleet Operations Software team at Saildrone. Prior to that, he was a senior engineer at Saildrone who built and maintained many of the early systems that powered the company. Todd currently cohabitates in Oakland with an elderly Dachshund.\n\n\nRecorded at Strange Loop 2021\nhttps://thestrangeloop.com"
