In general, simple computational models do not work sufficiently for this task, because of the complexity of mappings between text and its semantics.  However, linguistic theory called lexicalized grammar allows for accurate and efficient deep parsing.  In\nthis talk, I describe fundamental ideas of deep parsing and essential differences from shallow parsing techniques such as dependency parsing.  Additionally, I introduce applications of deep parsing, including information extraction and machine translation."
