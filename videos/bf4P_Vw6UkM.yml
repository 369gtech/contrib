description: "Last year the presenters of this session demonstrated a basic in-car system built with a Raspberry Pi and programmed with Java. The project has continued to evolve: now it is looking at how to further integrate the system through a hard-wired CAN bus connection, GPS tracking, and even biometric monitoring of the driver through a heart rate monitor. The display has also been enhanced to use a homemade  heads up  display. The session shows how embedded Java has been used to program all these pieces to create some very cool demos.\n\n\nAuthors:\nSimon Ritter\nSimon Ritter is head of Java Technology Evangelism at Oracle Corporation.
