title: 'Is Serverless backend the new black? - Henrik Lernmark'
recordingDate: 1505129864
description: "Serverless backend is the new black, or is it? And why? Will it increase efficiency and decrease my costs? Is the technology really good enough, and what about security? We aim to give you the answers on these and many other questions and talk about why it is worth the effort of hiking up the serverless hill. The talk will focus on services within Amazon Web Services such as Lambda, DynamoDB, API gateway, RDS, Aurora and S3. \n\nHenrik Lernmark, AWS consultant with a broad spectrum of programming and technical expertise ranging from HTML to hardware construction and an occassional beer inbetween. \n___________________________\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry in the Malmö/Lund region.
