description: 'This session focuses on developing modules with the Java Platform Module System in JDK 9. Using well-known libraries as examples, you will learn how to develop libraries and applications as modules and will also find out how to migrate existing code to modules. Migration poses many challenges, and in addition to learning about “bottom-up” migration, you will learn about “top-down” migration, where libraries and applications are migrated to modules without waiting for libraries they depend on to migrate first.'
