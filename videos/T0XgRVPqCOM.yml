description: "Do your teams release software to production weekly, daily or every hour ? Do you practice software development with tools, process and culture that can respond to the speed of market and customer changes? Agility allows you to experiment with new business models, learn from your mistakes and identify patterns that work. Deliver faster, look for feedback, gain knowledge. In every market, speed wins.\n\nCloud-Native describes the patterns of high-performing organizations delivering software faster, consistently and reliably at scale.   Continuous delivery, DevOps, and microservices label the why, how and what of the cloud-natives, the true digital enterprises.\n\nSpeaker: Colin Humphreys, Global Cloud CTO, Pivotal"
