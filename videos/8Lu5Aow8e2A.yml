description: "Dmitry Karpov\n\nIn Wargaming we make real-time high load apps with python. Here Iâ€™d tell you some issues which might appear when using it for real-time apps with some examples.\n\nUsually Python isn't treated as a proper choice for big data and especially for real-time applications. In this talk I would like to tell you how we deal with half-million average online active gamers simultaneously playing on different maps, how we send and receive 10 thousands spatial event data per client per session (like moving on the map, interaction with other players and destructible objects on the map) with pure Python\n\nWe will discuss some tips and tricks on how to use Python in this kind of applications. Python has to be modified to handle real-time requirements because of its architecture and we will talk which modifications are necessary for it."
