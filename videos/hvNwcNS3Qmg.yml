description: "Landscape Gardener: Keep n CF Landscapes Blooming Continuously - Andreas Heix & Martin Schröder, SAP\n\nIt's not an easy task to keep one CF landscape up and updated all the time. Doing this with several landscapes with varying BOMs (bill of material) on different IaaS in parallel does not make it easier. In this session, Martin and Andreas will give an overview on how they organize as a multinational, 3-time-zone team of landscape gardeners trying to keep the landscapes blooming. They will share details on the collaboration with the development organizations. Judge for yourself where this fits your idea of \"DevOps\" or \"SRE\". A larger section will be dedicated to the alerting and monitoring approach which focus on the customers' scenarios as main health indicator. Not all flowers bloom and thrive all the time –Andreas and Martin will also share some of the challenges they have with their own stuff and also with the concepts of CloudFoundry.\n\nAbout Andreas Heix\nAndreas Heix works as PO for the operational parts of SAP’s CF for two years. The mix of customers, CF, used IaaS-es, the processes and the teams are his focus. Prior to this, he was running the CI-Infrastructure for Mobile App development within SAP. Andreas gives demos and speeches and moderates workshops within SAP or with customers. He prefers cycling, football and cooking anytime over a livesite-down call.\n\nAbout Martin Schroeder\nMartin Schroeder works as a ProductOwner for the CloudFoundry Landscape Operations team at SAP. Topics like Monitoring and handling of multiple landscapes in parallel are of specific interest for him. During his 18 years of working for SAP, Martin worked in several roles in software engineering."
