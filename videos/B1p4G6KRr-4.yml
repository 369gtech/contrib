description: 'The Spring Framework ecosystem allows for a wide array of application styles. In this talk we will dive into Reactive Application development using Spring Boot, Cloud Native BuildPacks (CNB) and Kubernetes. We''ll explore a typical use case with reactive streams to expose data across client / services while leveraging Spring Boot and CNB to ensure proper configuration of our apps on Kubernetes. Finally, to make PR''s safe and effective, we''ll write some tests to kick the tires on our app and form a convenient TDD cycle to boot!'
