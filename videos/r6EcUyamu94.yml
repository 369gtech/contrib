title: 'Rootless Containers with runC'
recordingDate: 1484829960
description: "Aleksa Sarai\nhttp://linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/43/\nEssentially all popular container runtimes require some form of root privileges\r\nin order to create and manage containers. This becomes a problem for certain\r\nsystems, where administrators are hesitant to install any software, let alone a\r\ncontainer runtime -- many of which allow for privileged containers without\r\nauthentication.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, Aleksa Sarai will describe recent work done within runC by himself\r\nand other maintainers to allow people to use rootless containers with a\r\nwell-supported container runtime, as well as discussing challenges discovered by\r\nthis work and kernel work which is being done to alleviate these challenges and\r\nbring a new form of containers to users and developers. In addition, he will\r\nbriefly talk about image formats and the management of images without privileges\r\nas well."
