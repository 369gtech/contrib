description: "Beauty in Code 2018 was a single-track full day IT-conference held at the Malmö Live conference center on March 3, 2018, featuring seven different speakers from three continents.\nAino Vonge Corry about her session \"A Comment on how we learn\": As an expert you will be asked to facilitate the learning of others, not to mention your personal eternal learning in your field. Join an interactive session about how our brains accept new knowledge and store it for later use. Your take-away will be three-fold; how to chunk information you give to others, how to improve your own learning AND something to entertain with at dull parties."
