language: English
recordingDate: 1474123471
description: 'Managing the consistency of interactive visualizations in the face of inherent asynchrony and reordering of events in modern data visualizations is challenging. This talk will go over a new view (query) based model for interactive visualization and show how database transaction techniques could apply to consistency for visualization scenarios, and present a set of declarative policies to maintain visualization consistency. We will a see a demo of this DSL in action.'
