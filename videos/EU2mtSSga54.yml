title: 'Tanzu Tuesdays 68 - Azure Functions: a guide to getting started with Layla Porter'
language: English
recordingDate: 1631675637
description: "Working with an existing system and its architecture can be a challenge, especially when it comes to adopting newer technologies. What may originally have been an appropriate architecture, may not now easily accommodate these newer technologies\n\nDo we tackle the problem by refactoring our system, or do we need an overhaul?\n\nMore often than not, business critical features don’t allow for a rewrite nor a rebuild, so we are faced with shoehorning new features into the existing project using the older framework or architecture.\n\nThis is where serverless technologies, such as Azure Functions, can come to the rescue.\n\nBy using Azure Functions you can create solutions using modern .NET/C# features without necessarily touching older parts of our existing software.\n\nIn this session I will show you how to build a service using Azure Functions.\n\nWe will use a variety of function triggers such as HTTP and Queue, combining them together into a self contained service that can co-exist with our existing project.\n\nWe’ll also cover security, developing functions locally, architecture and much more.\n---\n\nLayla Porter is a Developer Advocate at VMware serving the .NET community.
