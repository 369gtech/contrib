description: "Michał Kasprzyk (Spice Speakers Bureau): How to leverage public speaking to market your business\n\nThink about Gary Vaynerchuk and his marketing strategy - lots of content, most of it in video with many speeches delivered at events around the world. Or a closer example - Paweł Tkaczyk or Michał Sadowski. Speaking at conferences is a vital part of their businesses. Very few people consider public speaking a marketing tool, yet it's a powerful one. It's actually a part of content marketing in which you have a chance of presenting yourself as an expert to a group of specific people (target!) who want to listen. What a great opportunity! But how to leverage it? I want to tell participants exactly that - tips&tricks, case studies, knowledge based on practice - 100% mięso.\n\nThe speech was given on 2018-05-22 at infoShare 2018 (Marketing Stage) in Gdańsk.\n\nMore info: http://infoshare.pl \nFollow us: https://facebook.com/infosharepl\nhttps://twitter.com/infosharepl\nhttps://instagram.com/infoshare/\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/1272775/\nhttps://plus.google.com/+infoshare/"
