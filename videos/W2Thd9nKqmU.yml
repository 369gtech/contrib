description: "Many people say that simple code is better code, but fewer put it into practice. In this talk I’ll spend a little time on why simpler is better, and why we resist simplicity. Then I’ll provide some specific approaches that are likely to make your code simpler, and discuss what you need to know and do in order to consistently write simpler code and reap the benefits of that simplicity.\n\nEVENT:\n\nCppCon 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nKate Gregory\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nCppCon Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Ak6xtVXno"
