description: "There are Priorities, Priorities, and then there are PRIORITIES \nby Clive McDonald\n(@sumologic)\n\nToday IT is generally seen as a critical if not essential part of our daily live’s, the data that it generates is readily accepted to be of essential importance. From mundane user generated data such as word documents (but only mundane as its content), to critical infrastructure regulating electricity supplies (but only critical if service affecting). One of the challenges we face is how do we understand what data is of critical importance and what is not. In addition another layer of added complexity is that one departments criticality is anothers nuisance, so how do we advise and decide as IT professionals what an organization really needs? Firstly in order to make an ‘informed’ decision we need to be….. Informed.\n\nWe at Sumo Logic will enable you to create a platform which enables you to collect the right information in the right context, at the right time."
