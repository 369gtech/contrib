description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nGitOps and the CD Pipeline - Friend or Foe? - Tracy Ragan, DeployHub Inc.\n\nWhile GitOps is solving some big problems for continuous deployments, does the operations by pull request model fit into a continuous delivery pipeline? In this session we will explore the ‘front end’ of GitOps and how the CD pipeline will need to shift to embrace a GitOps approach, particularly around independently deployed microservices. The question to answer is how will the CD Pipeline automate the GitOps steps that are currently done by a human, such as updating .yaml files, submitting pull requests and approving commits. With potentially thousands of .yaml files, automation of these steps will be critical."
