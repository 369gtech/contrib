title: 'Meetup #AperiTech Online Edition 23/04/2020 - Deep Learning Italia - Meetup di DLI'
language: Italian
recordingDate: 1588006990
description: "Si affronteranno temi legati esclusivamente alla progettazione e implementazione di Reti Neurali e il Deep Learning nell'Intelligenza Artificiale di oggi.\nIl Meetup di DLI nasce dall'esigenza di sopperire alla carenza di meetup tecnici sul Deep Learning in Italia mentre ormai se ne contano molteplici in altre città del mondo come Londra, Amsterdam e San Francisco. Il Meetup sarà orientato sia alla ricerca accademica e che al mondo delle startup.\n\nSpeakers:\n\n- Luca Pedrelli Director Academy @DLI - \"Deep Neural Networks for Time Series\"\nIn this talk,  Deep Echo State Networks has been presented as a tool to analyze and design efficient deep recurrent architectures for real-world tasks concerning time-series and sequence modeling.\n\n- Lorenzo Giusti Data Scientist @ CERN - \"Extreme Rare events detection\" \nCERNs accelerators facilities require adequate tools to operate, maintain and guide the consolidation of the machines, to fulfil the physics program and deliver the required luminosity for the experiments. One of the main problems in the accelerators complex is the downtime due to a fault in the technical infrastructure which can cause up to hours of inactivity. However, the technical infrastructure is such a complex system that failure rate of a device is highly unlikely that have widespread impact and might destabilize the overall system, bringing the detection of an upcoming fault as a high priority task. In order to detect these extreme events, we propose a novel approach which exploits the strengths of the Denoising Autoencoders and the Bidirectional LSTM Neural Networks in order to learn the normal behaviour of a device analyzing its sensors and predict if it is being anomalous within the time necessary to maintain the infrastructure.\n\n \nPer restare aggiornato su tutti gli #AperiTech:\nTelegram #AperiTech https://t.me/aperitech\nCalendario del Developer https://bit.ly/devcalendar\nCodemotion Tech Community https://bit.ly/CodemotionTC"
