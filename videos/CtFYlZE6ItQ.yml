description: "Farfetchâ€™s mission is to be the global technology platform for luxury fashion. We sell products from over 1000 boutiques and brands from around the world, ship to customers in 190 countries with the help of 3000 employees in 13 different offices. Our platform runs on an active-active geo-distributed infrastructure in multiple regions, on thousands of servers, petabyte scale storage and a global software defined network.\n\nThe nature of this global setup and scale brings unique challenges and opportunities. One of the transformations that we have been working on is migrating our 500 microservices to run on containers in Kubernetes. As we embarked on this journey we realized the need to improve upon not just our technology but also our processes. So we built an abstraction layer called blueprints to capture all metadata of our services and its dependencies in a well-defined, source-controlled, always up-to-date framework. This has enabled us to be more agile and in control while we are adapting to the Kubernetes ecosystem.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks, courses, and conferences in the following links:\nhttps://ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
