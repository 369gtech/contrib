title: 'Wix Engineering Podcast, episode 03: Out of Your Comfort Zone'
recordingDate: 1591862830
description: "Yuval Perry is Wix’s SW Infrastructure Group and oversees what is one of the most complex and challenging infrastructures in the world of software engineering. But to get to this point, he had to step out of his own comfort zone, in a major way.\n\nBack in 2012, Yuval was working for a company who had more than 60 microservices, and managing those microservices was starting to become too difficult. Knowing that Wix is doing the same more than 1,300 microservices, he approached Aviran Mordo - Wix’s Head of Engineering - for advice. Aviran replied - “It’s very simple. You should start by deleting your integration and test environments”. It definitely wasn’t the answer Yuval was expecting…\n\nHow did Yuval manage to step out of his comfort zone, and implement an approach he himself describes as ‘either crazy or brilliant’? What can other developers learn from his experience, about learning novel technologies and new paradigms?"
