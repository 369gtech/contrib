description: "Machine learning has become a buzz word that goes beyond the tech industry. In the past three years, major players like Google, Facebook or Microsoft have been battling to snatch up specialized startups that have mastered a field of machine learning called Deep Learning. You can see it in action in products like Google Now, Google Photos, Microsoft Cortana or Skype Real Time Speech Translation. Deep Learning is the latest revolution in Artificial Intelligence, evolving the state of the art in feature engineering for machine learning models, and in deep neural networks.\n\nIn this talk we will demystify this emerging field, see how it works, its limits and how we can get started into building smart applications with it."
