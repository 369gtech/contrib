title: 'DrupalCon Baltimore 2017: Advanced debugging techniques'
recordingDate: 1493216961
description: 'Step-by-step debugging with Xdebug is no secret for you? Perfect then, because we won’t talk about it. We will rather see tools that let you know what’s really happening in your PHP code, like the phpdbg debugger, process tracing tools like: strace, ltrace, the Linux inotify mechanism, tcpdump/wireshark for network analysis or MySQL Proxy for real time SQL debugging and monitoring!'
