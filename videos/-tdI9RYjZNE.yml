description: "Perl(5) and Python(2/3), they're not so different. But the differences are ... significant[1].\n\nI'll provide a primer of similarities and differences to help you translate from one to the other. Let's have some fun looking at the differences between our languages and communities, all to help us understand and work together better.\n\nTopics:\n- philosophy\n- names\n- whitespace\n- blocks vs bracing\n- quotes\n- data structures\n- iteration\n- functions\n- named parameters\n- imports\n- modules and packages\n- classes\n- references\n- error handling (exceptions)\n- repl\n- regular expressions\n- strings\n- generators and comprehensions\n- with\n\n1: yes, that was a whitespace joke."
