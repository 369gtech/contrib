description: "Accelerating the Journey of an AI Algorithm to Production with OpenFaaS - Joost Noppen, BT PLC & Alex Ellis, OpenFaaS Ltd \n\nAt BT it used to take us 2-3 years to get from a research idea to an AI algorithm that can be consumed by an end-user in production. We needed to reduce the risk and the investment required to bring our products to market and get essential feedback. We addressed three key areas to improve: having a diverse range of developer skills amongst us researchers, a lack of modern packaging & CI/CD practice, a need for a cloud-native model to shrink-wrap and run our code in production at scale. Our journey lead us to Serverless Functions, come to our talk to hear how we implemented our pipeline for development and deployment of AI algorithms using OpenFaaS. We can now ship to production in just two months improving the rate of delivery by 90%. The talk will also cover how BT built their platform using the UNIX-like primitives made available through the OpenFaaS eco-system and include a live demo. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPeF"
