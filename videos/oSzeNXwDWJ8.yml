description: "Making your app accessible increases the size of your user base, often promotes search rankings, allows you to sell to the US government, and is just the right thing to do. In this talk, we’ll discuss:\n\n* Starting with an accessible design, instead of trying to shoehorn accessibility in later\n* Writing semantic HTML that can be understood by assistive technologies\n* Avoiding common design and implementation anti-patterns that hurt accessibility\n* Understanding accessibility standards such as WCAG 2.0\n* Ensuring that frameworks like Angular and React play nicely with accessibility\n* Performing real-world testing that accurately assesses how a disabled user would interact with your app\n\nYou don’t need to be a world-class developer to make accessible web content. With mindfulness and adherence to a few simple principles, you can broaden your user base and make the digital world a more inclusive place!\n\nDevConf 2017 (http://devconf.pl)\n13-15 September 2017"
