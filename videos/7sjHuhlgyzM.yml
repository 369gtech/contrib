description: 'â€žGetting Things Done" becomes more important, than any fancy framework or library. Out-of-the-box productivity, straight forward programming model and clear documentation are major features of the new Java EE platform. This session demonstrates (on ~3 slides :-) ) Java EE features, productivity and architecture from IDE perspective in a IDE-independent way. There should be enough time to take the look at the Java EE 7 platform and discuss why Java EE is more and more popular ...for startups.'
