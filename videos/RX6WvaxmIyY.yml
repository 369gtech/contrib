There’s no shortage of frameworks for testing, each with their particular spin and set of conventions and, but that glut is not always matched by a clear vision of how to structure and use tests — a framework is a vehicle, but you still need to know how to drive.\n\nCompared to many languages, C++ has had slower widespread adoption of unit testing. This talk takes a deep dive into the practices and issues, looking at examples and counterexamples in C++.\n-------\n\nKevlin Henney\nKevlin is an independent consultant, speaker, writer and trainer. His development interests are in programming, people and practice. He has been a columnist for a number of magazines and sites, including The Register, CUJ and C++ Report, a contributor to open source software and a member of more committees than is probably healthy (it has been said that \"a committee is a cul-de-sac down which ideas are lured and then quietly strangled\").\n\nHe is co-author of two volumes in the Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture series, and editor and contributor for multiple books in the 97 Things series. He lives in Bristol and online.\n-------\n\nC++ on Sea is an annual c++ and coding conference, usually held in Folkestone, Kent in the UK. The 2020 conference was moved to a virtual event due to social distancing requirements.\n\nProduced and Edited by Digital Medium Ltd: https://events.digital-medium.co.uk\nEnquiries: events@digital-medium.co.uk"
