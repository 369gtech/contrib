description: "Expressions are the most basic form of human interaction! Programming languages are trending more towards using expressions rather than procedural statements, adopting the declarative paradigm.\n\nIn this talk we will see how we can shift our mindset from procedural programming to functional programming. We will replace loops with lambda expressions and work through fun code examples. At the end of the talk, you will come away awed but not fearful of the reduce function! All code samples will be shared on GitHub. No prior experience in functional programming is necessary.\n\nAbout Manju Vijayakumar\nManju is a full stack engineer at Salesforce, where she works on Einstein Voice Assistant, bringing the best in class artificial intelligence capabilities to Salesforce CRM.
