In this process, it also gradually exposed some deficiencies of the current system in architecture design, security and function, and faced more and more challenges. Therefore, it is necessary for us to launch the dragonfly 2.0 project and give it a clearer positioning: providing enterprise level (efficient, stable, secure, low-cost, product oriented) file distribution and management services, becoming the cloud native best practice and standard solution in this field. The new Dragonfly 2.0 will definitely bring a breakthrough in the field of file and image distribution."
