description: "Erlang Factory SF Bay Area 2013\nMore info and slides on the website: http://www.erlang-factory.com/conference/SFBay2013/talks\n\nConsumer error, crash or down is a classic tech problem for applications involves producer and consumer. When guaranteed message delivery is a mandatory at consumer side, it is essential to have a general architecture or framework in place thus free the consumer of complicated logic such as error recovery or message re-delivery. \n\nIn this talk, we present a distributed framework which guarantees message delivery for producer/consumer applications. Producer and consumer can be distributed across network, no shared memory or state is needed, which fits Erlang process\nmodel very well. This framework suites well for applications/tasks that can be abstracted using producer/consumer model or chained\nproducers/consumers.\n\nA general guaranteed message delivery framework is built around open source no sql db redis. The framework has a redelivery mechanism, which redelivers message at configurable interval. Consumer feedback is essential in the control loop of the framework, which is used to remove message from retry or schedule retry at alternative pace. With the redeliver mechanism of the framework, consumer code does not need to worry about how to recover from a crash or downstream error while processing message/event. It can simply ignore or log an error and the system will put the same message/event in the consumer queue for redelivery at certain time later.\n\nWith building blocks, an Erlang lib for producer/consumer, we believe the system can benefit the community and developers for easily building system or applications that provides reliable message delivery."
