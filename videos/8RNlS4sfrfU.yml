recordingDate: 1548206106
description: "J Rosenbaum\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/220/\n\nAugmented Reality and Virtual Reality are this year’s hottest buzzwords when it comes to art. Are they just gimmicks or is there something deeper behind the work? When artists can create whole immersive worlds or blur the line between the digital and the real what we have to say is still of the most importance. This talk is about the latest technologies and how to stay on track and not get (too) distracted by the shiny new other options out there! J Rosenbaum is a digital artist working in 3D Modeling and Augmented Reality with Machine Learning based interactions. Join us as they unpack what new technology brings to art and what artists bring to new technologies.\r\n\r\n⚠️ Content warning: This talk contains images of artistic nudity\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
