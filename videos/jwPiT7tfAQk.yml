description: "APEX development is not just about Oracle PL/SQL and SQL. In fact, it requires other disciplines to provide an enhanced user experience. With some knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, your APEX applications can begin to shine. However, you need a helper to better work with these technologies. If you're running SQL, you may use SQL Developer, but what do you use for HTML, JavaScript, and CSS? Enter DevTools. In this session, we'll cover the built-in DevTools available in all modern browsers.\n\nLearn the ins and outs of these tools and how they improve your everyday work with APEX. They are easy to use. No installation required and a just keystroke away.\n\n\nA recording provided by the awesome APEX community, that built a virtual 24 hour conference called APEX@Home held on April 16th 2019.\n\n\nWith 24 world renowned speakers and nearly 5000 virtual attendees, this event was a huge success.
