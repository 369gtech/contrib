title: 'A Little REST with JAX-RS 2.0 and Java EE 7'
recordingDate: 1401441338
description: "Enterprise Java projects tend to misuse JAX-RS for the implementation of RPC-style architectures. In this session I will code a simplistic REST-application with JavaEE 7 and share some tricks, tips and techniques from my projects. Questions are highly appreciated and are going to be answered live.This session was delivered during the JEE 2014 conference in Kiev.\n\nSee you live soon at: http://airhacks.com or http://airhacks.io"
