description: "Refinement Reflection, or how to turn (Liquid) Haskell into a theorem prover - Niki Vazou (Lambda Days 2017)\n\nhttp://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2017/niki-vazou\n\nWe present Refinement Reflection, a method to extend legacy languages---with highly tuned libraries, compilers, and run-times---into theorem provers.\nThe key idea is to reflect the code implementing a user-defined function into the function's (output) refinement type.\nAs a consequence, at uses of the function, the function definition is unfolded into the refinement logic in a precise and predictable manner.\nWe have implemented our approach in Liquid Haskell thereby retrofitting theorem proving into Haskell.\nWe show how to use reflection to verify arithmetic properties of common recursive functions as well as program equivalence of computations that use Haskellâ€™s highly tuned parallel runtime environment."
