title: 'Fog Computing and IoT Solution Architecture by Kilton Hopkins'
language: English
recordingDate: 1492679009
description: "Fog Computing gives you the ability to run code in a physical space but control it like it's the cloud. For Internet of Things solutions, the physical spaces might be hospital rooms, racks in a warehouse, or the interiors of delivery vehicles.\n\nIn some cases, your IoT solution must use processing that occurs directly in the physical space in order to function properly. In other cases, it is simply an architectural choice that reduces costs, increases privacy and security, or improves performance.\n\nCome see the benefits and common use cases of Fog Computing, learn how it works, and see where it fits in IoT solution architecture.\n\nKilton Hopkins\nI have been programming since I was 8 years old. That was 1986 and computers were very different. All of the effort I spent trying to make things work properly back then has turned out to be very helpful, though. I have been pushing the boundaries of what can be done with technology ever since.\n\nI've co-founded several technology startups, managed software products with over $100 million in annual revenue, and received my MBA from The University of Chicago Booth School of Business.\n\nI continually learn about new technologies (or old stuff that I didn't understand before) and I love to help others understand technology in a deep, meaningful way."
