description: "This talk on PostCSS, will give you a quick overview of what PostCSS can do for you, how you can leverage PostCSS plugins to take a lot of the developer error out of front-end development.\n\nOriginally from a farm in New Zealand, picked up programming while applying for a job in economics and never looked back. Mostly Rubyist, JS and CSS are my second and third loves. I teach people how to code through Rails Girls and Ruby Tea Party as I want to demystify the industry.\n\nCSSConf.Asia - Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore - 18 November 2015.\n\nSource: http://2015.cssconf.asia\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
