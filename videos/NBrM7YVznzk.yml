description: "WebAR is coming! And some would argue that it's already here. Developing augmented reality on the web can sound very complex. This is why I developed a way to make it easier for anyone to do AR, and I want to share it with you. It is called AR.js. In this talk I will take you through what WebAR is, what are its possibilities and its challenges. We will take a look at the major players and the recent developments in the AR world. Finally, I will share some demos made with AR.js, a fully open-source solution to do efficient augmented reality on the web!\n\nJerome is the creator of AR.js, making WebAR a reality! He is the author of the Learning Three.js blog and the 8th most active user on Github. He has been CTO at Daqri and is a hardcore Javascript and WebGL developer.\n\n\nJSConf.Asia - Capitol Theatre, Singapore - 27 January 2018\n\nSource: https://2018.jsconf.asia/\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
