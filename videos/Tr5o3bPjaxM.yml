title: 'C# Scripting in the .NET Core world - Filip W'
recordingDate: 1494487646
description: "While still being relatively niche, over the recent years C# scripting has grown to become a first class citizen in the Roslyn compiler and can now be enjoyed and applied in your applications in various ways.\nTogether, we will dissect whatâ€™s going on under the hood in C# scripting and how you can make use of it in the cross platform, lightweight, .NET Core world (which, by the way, creates a perfect environment for low ceremony C# scripting). We'll also have a look at scripting via the new .NET CLI, how you can integrate it into your everyday development workflows and how you can debug the script assemblies."
