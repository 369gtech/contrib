Building an app, but your organization doesn't have an API yet? If so, you've probably got legacy content—content that already exists, and that doesn't fit neatly into your new project.\n\nWhat do you do? You could ignore it and end up with one of those responsive homepages that devolve into big content blobs after just one tap, or a one-off mobile site that no one can remember to maintain. You could put it off until it becomes the bane of your existence: the thing that \"breaks\" your design, because it's way messier than you’ve planned for.\n\nOr, you could deal with it. If you take the time to make existing content work for you—by understanding what you've got, identifying patterns and relationships in its structure, and cutting the cruft along the way—you'll end up with a system that will not just support your content, but enhance its meaning, message, and power.\n\nIn this talk, you'll learn how to start analyzing content and understanding its structure—and see how content knowledge can help make your mobile products better and longer-lasting.\n\nAbout Sara: http://www.sarawb.com\nAbout Mobilism: https://mobilism.nl\n\nVideography generously sponsored by Mirabeau: https://www.mirabeau.nl"
