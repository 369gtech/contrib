description: "As a follow up to his previous video on using Nearby Messages with Beacons (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7InjJGqP15E), Marc Wandschneider introduces the new Proximity Beacon APIs to show how to register beacons and prepare them for subscription via Nearby Messages. Nearby is a new API that enables your device to react to nearby objects and micro-locations such as bus stops, train platforms, or even indoor locations such as exhibits in a museum. BLE beacons -- such as those that support Eddystone, an open beacon format from Google -- can be an important source of information about these locations.\n\nUsing beacons with the Nearby Messages API is a fairly straightforward process that requires only a few steps: Gather your beacons, register them and attach message data with the Proximity Beacon API, and then register with Nearby Messages to receive notifications based on sightings of these beacons. Then the skyâ€™s the limit for what your applications can do with this information.\n\nMore information:\nhttps://developers.google.com/beacons\nhttps://developers.google.com/nearby\nhttps://github.com/google/eddystone\n\n100 Days of Google Dev / 100 developer videos over 100 days / #GoogleDev100 \n\nSubscribe to the Google Developers channel at http://goo.gl/mQyv5L"
