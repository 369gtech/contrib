description: "Slides: https://www.slideshare.net/scottjenson/beyond-mobile-beyond-web\n\nToday's mobile phone is a combination of two aging paradigms: native applications and web browsing. Each is fine on their own but the mixture is actually taking the worst of both. The mobile web has the potential to be a transformative technology, doing so much more than just downloading a web page on a small screen. Native applications, for their part, are a siloed holdover from main frames, forcing the user to manage the discovery, installation, and removal of all functionality.\n\nThis is tolerable today because there is relatively little need to manage functionality on your phone. Installing a few apps really isn't that burdensome. However, the plummeting cost of processing and connectivity will change that creating an explosion of smart posters, devices, televisions, and more, all of which will likely require their own 'app'. It just isn't possible to install an app for every store I visit, every product I own, and and every smart thingy I pass in the street. This talk will explore a new approach, combining the best of native and mobile web to create a 'just-in-time' model of functionality.\n\nAbout Scott: https://jenson.org/about-scott/\nAbout Mobilism: https://mobilism.nl"
