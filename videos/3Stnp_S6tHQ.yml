recordingDate: 1446721615
description: "“What if this thing was magic?” Designing for the internet of things means blessing everyday objects, places, even people with extraordinary abilities—requiring designers, too, to break with the ordinary. Designing for this new medium is less a challenge of technology than imagination. Sharing a rich trove of examples, designer and author Josh Clark explores the new experiences that are possible when ANYTHING can be an interface.\n\nThe digital manipulation of physical objects (and vice versa) effectively turns all of us into wizards. Sling content between devices, bring objects to life from a distance, weave ””spells”” by combining speech and gesture. But magic doesn’t have to be otherworldly; the UX of connected devices should build on the natural physical interactions we have everyday with the world around us. The new UX must bend technology to the way we live our lives, not the reverse. Explore the values and design principles that amplify our humanity, not just our superpowers.\n\nJosh Clark is the founder of Big Medium, a design agency specializing in connected devices, mobile experiences, and responsive web design. His clients include TechCrunch, Time Inc, eBay, O’Reilly Media, and many others. Josh wrote ””Tapworthy: Designing Great iPhone Apps”” (O’Reilly, 2010) and the forthcoming ””Designing for Touch”” (A Book Apart, 2015). He speaks around the world about what’s next for digital interfaces.\n\nBefore the internet swallowed him up, Josh was a producer of national PBS programs at Boston’s WGBH. He shared his three words of Russian with Mikhail Gorbachev, strolled the ranch with Nancy Reagan, hobnobbed with Rockefellers, and wrote trivia questions for a primetime game show. In 1996, he created the uberpopular ””Couch-to-5K”” (C25K) running program, which has helped millions of skeptical would-be exercisers take up jogging. (His motto is the same for fitness as it is for software user experience: no pain, no pain.)\n\nFor more on YOW! Connected, visit http://connected.yowconference.com.au"
