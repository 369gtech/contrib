language: English
recordingDate: 1600704941
description: "AppSettings are a big deal in .NET Core. If you are just using appsettings.json, you are really missing out. There is so much more just with the defaults. In fact, by default, we get five different places to put our settings in each .NET Core application. In this video, we will talk about how to use three of those default locations. We will also talk about how you can learn more about AppSettings in my full course titled .NET Core AppSettings In Depth.\n\nBuy the course with coupon: https://sso.teachable.com/secure/288799/checkout/2437305/net-core-appsettings-in-depth?coupon_code=celebrate2020 (Use coupon code Celebrate2020)\nSee the course here: https://www.iamtimcorey.com/p/net-core-appsettings-in-depth/?product_id=2437305\nSource Code: https://leadmagnets.app/?Resource=IntroToAppSettings\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/IAmTimCorey\nMailing List:  https://signup.iamtimcorey.com/\n\nThanks to Ralfs HBK for the topic time stamps:\n0:00 - Intro\n3:17 - Where .Net  AppSettings are used?
