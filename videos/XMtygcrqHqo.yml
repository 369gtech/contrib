description: "Speakers: Deborah Hanus, Patricia Hanus, Sebastian Hanus, Veronica Hanus\n\nUsing Jupyter notebooks, HTTP requests, BeautifulSoup, NumPy, Pandas, scikit learn, and matplotlib, you’ll predict whether a movie is likely to [win an Oscar](http://oscarpredictor.github.io/) or be a box office hit. We’ll step through the creation of an effective dataset: asking a question your data can answer, writing a web scraper, and answering those questions using nothing but Python libraries and data from the Internet. \n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2018 and https://github.com/PyCon/2018-slides"
