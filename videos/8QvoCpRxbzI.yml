Nor do you think of doing it frequently. And I want to persuade you that deleting your precious local environment this way is a Very Good Thing Indeed.\n\nBecause, friends, db:reset will not only delete your database, but it will seed it too.\n\nAnd by spending quality time with your seeds file, I believe you’ll make your entire development team more productive.\n\nYou’ll give your project the opportunity to grow its own shared development environment – a beautiful, idealistic place where all devs can talk through the same problem in the same context.\n\nReady to reset with me?"
