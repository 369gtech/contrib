description: "Learn to draw on the web with HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. We'll use primitive shapes like rectangles, circles and lines to visualize data and create generative art. We'll get a taste of D3.js to design and animate our graphics. We'll also use D3 for simple mapmaking, learning the basics of spatial visualization and geographic projections.\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
