description: "DOES18 Las Vegas — Digital transformation, especially for larger organizations, invariably involves the mainframe. For some organizations the mainframe remains an integral component of their corporate strategy and business operations. For others, the mainframe is an aging resource they want to leave behind. Whatever the direction an organization takes with their mainframe, doing it right depends on more than just a vision or business imperative. This panel of practitioners and analysts will share their experiences on: Best places to start a DevOps journey with a mainframe. Common errors to avoid. Culture—how to change it, how to get buy-in. What to keep on the mainframe (and how). What to move off the mainframe (and how). Impact on the toolchain for either choice.\n\nMainframe: Love It or Leave It?
