Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nWeighing a Cloud: Measuring Your Kubernetes Clusters - Han Kang, Google & Elana Hashman, Red Hat \n\nKubernetes is complicated. Instrumenting it can be worse. Measuring the components of a distributed system shouldn't be as daunting as being asked to weigh a literal cloud.     In this talk, we'll go over the components of a Kubernetes control-plane and show you where to look to figure out what is actually happening. We will show you common cluster issues and how they would look in your instrumentation, so that you can more effectively diagnose clusters.    Starting in version 1.14, Kubernetes metrics were overhauled to provide consistent, high quality metrics. Han Kang and Elana Hashman will go over the changes and the potential ingestion implications of this overhaul and how it may affect you. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UaeP"
