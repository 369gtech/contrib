description: "Maia Sauren\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/223/\n\nHave a call instead of sending email, they said. It's better for communication, they said.\r\n\r\nWhat if everyone hates meetings, and the rooms are perpetually booked, and nobody understands your accent? How do you do that day in, day out with an international team across time zones and languages? How do you keep everyone engaged, make sure work doesn’t get siloed between sites, ensure everyone feels empowered to ask questions? What if one group doesn’t quite speak the common language, or isn’t up to speed on how to push back on work?  How about resolving conflict, or translating professional contexts?\r\n\r\nThis talk is the coalescing of years of experience working with many international teams in multiple countries. It will cover: successful and unsuccessful strategies for pulling together software teams across time and space; embracing the awkward; spotting conflicts before they escalate; translating context and taxonomy; and how to grow participation and collaboration. Most importantly, it will go through how to stealthily work yourself out of a job by teaching everyone else to do it.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
