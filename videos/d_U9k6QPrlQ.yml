title: 'Why Twisted Is The Best And How It Will Make Your Application Awesome'
recordingDate: 1484706508
description: "Amber Brown\nhttp://linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/123/\nTwisted has been around a long time in the Python world. Pioneering the Deferred abstraction, which later turned into Promises and found their way into JavaScript, it is a fertile ground for asynchronous I/O experimentation. Through its groundbreaking protocol/transport design that some of us might take for granted these days, and a strict adherence to unit testing and representing things through abstract interfaces, it lets you talk a lot of different network protocols without really having to know everything about them.\r\n\r\nIt can make your application awesome."
