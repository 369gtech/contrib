description: "Speakers: John Blum and Jagdish Mirani, Pivotal \nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/session-state-caching-with-spring\n\nCaching is a common and effective pattern for scaling applications in near real-time to handle increased load & demand. This is particularly important for cloud-native applications that serve a multitude of users, devices and even other applications. Caching can be applied in several tiers of the application and (HTTP) session state is no exception. Spring Session offers a robust, yet portable, solution that avoids container lock-in without sacrificing robust features like clustering. It seamlessly allows you to plug in different provider implementations, including Spring Session for Apache Geode, to cluster session state in a reliable, consistent, and scalable manner. Following this webinar, you will understand how session state caching using Spring Session with Apache Geode provides a reliable experience to end-usersâ€”an experience that is resilient to system failures, constant reconfiguration and continuous changes in both the underlying infrastructure and applications as they evolve."
