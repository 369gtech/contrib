description: "Microservices and containers can be hard, and best practices are still being discovered. In this session we'll learn about container orchestration, specifically Kubernetes, by bringing DevOps best practices into the mix.\r\n\r\nThis is not another \"Hello World\" session with quick tips, but rather a deep dive into how you can truly go from zero to DevOps superhero by selecting container tooling built for simplifying the process. You'll also learn how these tools can provide better orchestration for cloud services, abstraction and encapsulation for your microservices deployments, and visibility into what runs where and why.\r\n\r\nYou will walk away with a deeper understanding of this area and also hands-on material to help you get started."
