language: English
recordingDate: 1538585329
description: "Many large organizations 'bought' into the promise of big data architectures. Most, if not, all financial institutions have a big data architecture that may or may not fit the problems they're looking to solve. We had an interesting journey trying to leverage a big data architecture for data processing and client reporting. Weâ€™ve since pivoted and migrated to a pattern that is much more stable and sustainable. This talk will walk through the pre and post architectures and highlight how Spring and PCF enabled Northern Trust to accelerate the delivery of functionality to our customers.\nSpeaker: Lenny Jaramillo\nLead Architect, Northern Trust\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
