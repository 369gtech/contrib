description: "Art and Science of Optimizing Your Cloud Native Java Apps - Siva Balan, GE\n\nCloud native apps are a beast when it comes to optimization and troubleshooting. There is no silver bullet to achieve them and it requires a multi-dimensional approach. This session will go through some of those approaches, its pros and cons and how to effectively optimize the bits running on CF. It will also showcase some real life use cases of optimization and troubleshooting techniques that helped GE Digital to run its Java apps effectively on Cloudfoundry. \n\nAbout Siva Balan\nSiva has been doing performance engineering for the past 15 years starting with 3-tier architecture to cloud native architecture. Since joining GE Digital 4 years ago, he has been doing performance engineering for apps and services deployed on Cloudfoundry. He has presented at the CF summit 2016 at Frankfurt on \"Performance Engineering of services deployed on CF\". Current projects include performance engineering of Java apps and services deployed to CF on Azure, DB performance engineering and using Splunk as a dashboard for Performance test results."
