title: 'Fn Project â€“ an open source container native serverless platform - Matthew Gilliard'
language: English
recordingDate: 1639666812
description: "Serverless computing and FaaS (Function as a Service) are the new blacks! They radically change how software is organized, deployed, and charged for, and is in the process of further disrupting the still-evolving world of cloud computing.\n\nThis hands-on session will introduce you to 'Fn Project' (http://fnproject.io), a new open source serverless platform, which features a code-first approach to building polyglot applications. We will discuss Fn Flow, a CompletionStage like API, used to compose multiple functions into meaningful applications. No flow-charts, no exoteric stuff, just plain readable and testable (Java) code! And although 'Fn Project' is polyglot, this session will focus mostly on the Java and Kotlin side of it.\n#Serverless\n\nPresented by Matthew Gilliard\n\nSubscribe to our channel: https://youtube.pl/c/DevoxxPoland?sub_confirmation=1\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DevoxxPL\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/grzegorz.duda.official/\n\nJoin us also here:\nTechnology Radar Review: https://dworld.pl/radar\nDevelopers World Academy: https://dworld.pl/akademia\nDevflix: https://devflix.pl\n\n#Devoxx #DevoxxPoland #IT #Development #SoftwareDevelopment"
