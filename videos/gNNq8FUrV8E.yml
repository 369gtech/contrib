description: "Groovy is awesome - that’s a fact. But did you know that Spring Cloud’s awesome too? In this talk I won't go through all of the Spring Cloud's tools since lot of people already know them. Not that many know about Spring Cloud Sleuth (the distributed tracing solution for your cloud) and Spring Cloud Stream (messaging between microservices has never been that easy!).\n\nIn this presentation we’ll see a Groovy microserviced based system using the Spring Cloud tooling. We’ll focus on distributed tracing with Spring Cloud Sleuth and Zipkin. I'll also show how we're testing our libraries with Gradle. I'll prove that in Spring Cloud it's enough to just change a dependency and configuration in order to completely change for example the service discovery provider. Without changing a single line of production code!"
