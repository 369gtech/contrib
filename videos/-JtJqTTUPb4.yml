description: "Making the shift from technologist to successful leader is challenging. The transition causes anxiety for most of us as we fear being seen as incompetent. The shift has us move from a world of well-defined problems to one that is grey, ambiguous and often has long feedback loops.\n\nThis presentation will share the insights of the 40 digital leaders interviewed (with a combined experience of over 400 years in tech) on how they became leaders and what it takes to be a successful Digital Leader.\n\nLearn how to transition from technology to people, balance tactical and strategic operation and the 5 key recommendations of the Digital Leaders Career Success pyramid.\n\nIâ€™m a CTO and Leadership Development Coach with 15+ years in digital product development. I have worked on digital transformations, strategies and lean startup product development for major clients such as BCG DV, Qantas, Suncorp, Telstra and VW, in Europe, China, USA and Australia.\n\nFor more on YOW! conferences, visit http://www.yowconference.com.a"
