description: "It is said that there will be 20 to 50 billion connected devices by 2020, generating US$14.4 trillion in value. M2M—with machines connected so data can be exchanged among assets—works by embedding a communication module, sensor, or tag in a physical asset so that information about its status and performance can be sent to an information system, which enables a corporation to remotely monitor, maintain, and track these machines. However, the M2M value chain is highly fragmented and complex. M2M development is complex, and current options are closed and monolithic. To overcome this, we need new value business models and platforms. In this technical session, learn about the horizontal platforms to be applied to several Internet of Things/M2M vertical markets.\n\n\nAuthors:\nTak Nishida\n-0\nView more trainings by Tak Nishida at https://www.parleys.com/author/tak-nishida\n\nDavid Hofert\n-0\nView more trainings by David Hofert at https://www.parleys.com/author/david-hofert\n\nAkihiro Saito\nAkihiro Saito is a senior operating officer and a general manager of IT Solutions business group in SUNCORPORATION, a leading provider of wireless M2M adapter, router, gateway and remote monitoring solutions in Japan.
