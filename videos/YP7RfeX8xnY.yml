description: 'What if our flaws are not flaws at all. What if they''re just a footnote in our origin story? There are no victories if there is no opposition. No one in life gets a free pass from judgment. Â  By shifting your perspective and recasting failure as a place and time rather than an inherent defect, you can move towards self-acceptance.'
