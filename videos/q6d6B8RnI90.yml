Your app needs to be aware of when they've loaded, when the user has tapped on one to open it, and a number of other lifecycle events.\n\n\nIn this episode, we introduce you to the ad lifecycle and the listeners and delegates that help you tap into it. You'll learn what happens when, and which callbacks to use for things like pausing CPU-intensive tasks (read: game engines), muting audio, loading fresh ads, and so on. We're also breaking in a new format for going over code, so let us know what you think in the comments!\n\n\nLinks: \nObjective C: https://goo.gl/XqvD0O\nSwift Sample: https://goo.gl/L5Hfsp\nAndroid Sample: https://goo.gl/RxVi6B\niOS Ad Events Guide: https://goo.gl/wtKyW7\nAndroid Ad Events Guide: https://goo.gl/sXWxJD\nSDK Support Forum: https://goo.gl/MJfJ9N"
