description: "API development is a common challenge for many teams and companies. In a world of micro-services, multiple backends and ever more demanding front-ends, building the right set of APIs becomes more important.\n\nHow can a single API support a diverse set of clients, different data access patterns, and multiple SLAs?\n\nBackend for Frontend (BFF) is a pattern that has emerged to solve some of these challenges and help software engineers build better-focused APIs that can cater to different user experiences. This is achieved by actually building one backend for every frontend client.\n\nIn this talk, I want to discuss and present some of the experience and the challenges me and my team ran into while building API services for all our frontends at IFTTT.\n\n==========\n\nThis recording is presented by: Ressort Broadcast - Forschungsgemeinschaft elektronische Medien e.V.\n\nhttps://broadcast.fem.tu-ilmenau.de/\n\n==========\nLicence: CC BY-ND https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/legalcode"
