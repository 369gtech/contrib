description: 'Lean Startups are effectively combining Agile methods with Customer Development practices in order to better meet the changing and uncertain needs of the market. But what about well stablished companies that already have a proven business model and identified customers? How can we achieve a similar Agility Level if our teams are already Agile but the company as a whole is not? In other words: how to reach Business Agility? This talk will give insights on the Customer Development cycle and how it interacts with the Agile Product Development Cycle, creating a double loop of learning.'
