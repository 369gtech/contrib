description: "What exciting things happened in the JavaScript language and the V8 engine in 2019? Shu and Leszek take a tour of some new features and improvements. For JavaScript, learn about new syntax, like optional chaining and nullish coalescing, that make expressing common patterns a breeze, as well as the powerful new weak references that may help plug memory leaks. For V8, learn how the engine got faster with streaming parsing and slimmer with pointer compression.\n\nResources:\nV8 blog post archive → https://goo.gle/2Zd20tp \nOptional chaining → https://goo.gle/2NxDe1B \nNullish coalescing → https://goo.gle/2BDB9yx \nWeak references and finalizers → https://goo.gle/3dDdj3p \nPointer Compression in V8 → https://goo.gle/2YGk7ZT \nA lighter V8 → https://goo.gle/387plk4 \n\nRelated Playlist:\nDay 2 → https://goo.gle/WDL20Day2\n\nSubscribe to the Chrome Developers → https://goo.gle/ChromeDevs\n\nSpeaker:\nLeszek Swirski, Shu-yu Guo \n\n#webdevLIVE #javascript\""
