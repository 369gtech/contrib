description: "Angular Playground is a free and open source tool developed by SoCreate that improves your productivity when developing in Angular by allowing you to sandbox your components. On top of component sandboxing, Playground also provides other features such as: a sandbox error checker that can be integrated with your build system, the ability to embed sandboxes in an iframe (for use in a style guide), and cli schematics (ng add and ng generate).\n\nng-conf is a three-day Angular conference focused on delivering the highest quality training in the Angular JavaScript framework. 1500+ developers from across the globe converge on Salt Lake City, UT every year to attend talks and workshops by the Angular team and community experts.\n\nFollow us on twitter https://twitter.com/ngconf\nOfficial Website: https://www.ng-conf.org/"
