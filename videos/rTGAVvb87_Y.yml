description: "by Daniel Stenberg\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/UD2.208/http3.webm\n\n\nHTTP/3 is the next coming HTTP version. This time TCP is replaced by the new transport protocol QUIC and things are different yet again! HTTP/3 is the next coming HTTP version. \n\nThis time TCP is replaced by the new transport protocol QUIC and things are different yet again! This is a presentation about HTTP/3 and QUIC with a following Q&amp;A about everything HTTP. Join us at Goto 10. \n\nHTTP/3 is the designated name for the coming next version of the protocol that is currently under development within the QUIC working group in the IETF. \n\nHTTP/3 is designed to improve in areas where HTTP/2 still has some shortcomings, primarily by changing the transport layer. HTTP/3 is the first major protocol to step away from TCP and instead it uses QUIC. Daniel Stenberg does a presentation about HTTP/3 and QUIC. Why the new protocols are deemed necessary, how they work, how they change how things are sent over the network and what some of the coming deployment challenges will be. \n\nRoom: UD2.208 (Decroly)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 11:30:00+01"
