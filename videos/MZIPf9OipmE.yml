How do you build REST services and integrate with Spring Integration and RabbitMQ? What kind of role Node.JS can play in your architecture to simplify complex problems? We will address all of these questions and provide insight into design and architecture challenges to bring enterprise services to support modern client applications that expect REST Services."
