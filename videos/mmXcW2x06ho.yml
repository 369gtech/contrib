description: "Talk recording from AmsterdamJS December 2018 Meetup https://www.meetup.com/AmsterdamJS/events/255511327/\n\nThe frontend world is moving at an incredibly fast pace, there is just so much to know that feeling overwhelmed may just be the norm. It doesn't matter if you're a seasoned developer or a junior just starting out, comparing yourself to others will trigger many biases and feeling like a fraud is way more common than you may think. It even has a name: the impostor syndrome.\n\nAbout Claudio\n\nFull stack JavaScript developer, successfully pretending to know how to code for 15 years now."
