title: 'GeeCON 2018: Mauricio Salatino - From Java EE to Spring Cloud - Lessons Learned'
recordingDate: 1532330827
description: 'After working with both communities and technologies stacks I wanted to share my personal experiences while jumping from Java EE to the Spring Ecosystem (Spring Boot & Spring Cloud). This session will cover: lessons learned, common pitfalls, best practices and some interesting details about Spring Cloud. This presentation is about how an Open Source project moves forward from the concept of being a Java Framework to a set of Cloud Native building blocks. A road that you might be considering to take if you want to deploy your apps/services in Kubernetes.'
