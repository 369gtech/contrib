description: "My SAFe logbook: Records from 3+ years helping financial organisations to adopt SAFe\r\n\nThe 13th State of Agile Report shows that The Scaled Agile Framework – SAFe continues to be the most popular scaling method cited by respondents. This framework seems to have become the favorite of big organisations, mainly for the financial ones.\r\n\nAfter 3 years working in worldwide known financial organizations that have selected SAFe as their scaling Agile framework, I have witnessed many things that have worked and others those haven’t, practices and principles that are frequently misapplied or misunderstood as well as advantages and disadvantages of choosing SAFe as your scaling Agile framework.\r\n\nIn this session, I will share notes of my logbook of those journeys."
