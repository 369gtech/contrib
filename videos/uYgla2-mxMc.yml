description: "\"How To Build a Python Microservice Without Losing a Job\n[EuroPython 2019 - Talk - 2019-07-11 - Shanghai]\n[Basel, CH]\n\nBy Anton Caceres\n\nSarcastic talk, sharing real-life experience on both technical and social aspects of doing an architecture migration to microservices without losing a job.\n\nAny change in software architecture is a significant time investment. Writing microservices in Python is a joy, but when you decide on it, there is often no way back. Therefore it is always an advantage to know what to expect in advance, not just from inspiring blog posts but also from the harsh reality.\n\nI would like to share typical pitfalls of choosing a framework stack, communication protocol, conventions, and deployment process â€” all covered by real projects.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2019.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/"
