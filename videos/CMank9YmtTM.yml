description: "In this live stream, i'll build a real-time translation app from scratch using Node.JS and Tensorflow.js. We'll learn how machine learning can be used to help translate languages theoretically and programmatically. We'll also learn about how Node + Tensorflow work together and what the modern web development workflow that includes machine learning looks like.
