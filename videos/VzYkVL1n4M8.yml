title: 'Android Performance Patterns: Tool - Profile GPU Rendering'
language: English
recordingDate: 1420601041
description: "“If you can measure it, you can optimize it” is a common term in the computing world, and for Android’s rendering system, the same thing holds true. In order to optimize your pipeline to be more efficient for rendering, you need a tool to give you feedback on where the current perf problems lie.\n\nAnd in this video, Colt McAnlis walks you through an on-device tool that’s built for this exact reason. “Profile GPU Rendering” will help you understand the stages of the rendering pipeline, and also get a chance to see what portions of it might be taking too long, and what you can do about it for your application.\n\nWatch more Android Performance Patterns here: http://goo.gl/3dBbse\n\n#develop, #performance, #render, #tool, #gpu"
