title: 'Using a Bayesian Neural Network in the Detection of Exoplanets'
recordingDate: 1554520100
description: "Speaker: Esperanza LÃ³pez Aguilera, Member of Kx machine learning team\n\nThis talk will describe a NASA Frontier Development Lab research project to analyze satellite data (TESS) for the discovery of exoplanets. The project used time-series TCE data which posed a challenge in the design of our ML application, due to the high volume and added complexity associated with time-series data analytics. This issue was solved by using the programming language kdb+/q. Different models were trained and tested to compare performance due to the complexity of the data. Ultimately a Bayesian Neural Network was chosen, and we obtained 91% accuracy and 83% precision."
