description: "Don't forget to check out our links below!\nhttps://ndcoslo.com/\nhttps://ndcconferences.com/\n\nSometimes we need to go fast and we may find ourselves on a tight budget. In these situations it is important that we spend our time and resources right. It is still possible to be professional and apply best practices.\n\nIn this talk I will present lessons learnt from a hobby project building a system for organizing players in an MMO guild.\nThis will include\n- using bots in free chat apps for rapid development of user interactions,\n- using the chat app for OAuth authentication\n- Sanity for both free headless CMS, database and automatically generated management UI\n- Secure and scalable backend on secretless Kubernetes using Aks, Azure pod identity and keyvault"
