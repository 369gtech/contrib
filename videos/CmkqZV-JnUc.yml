recordingDate: 1636122420
description: "The tech industry is used for solving problems and making the world a better place. But is the tech industry really a better place for everyone?\n\nIt takes more than technical skills and hard work to excel in tech. Gender, race, ethnicity, religion, disability, sexual orientation are among those factors that affect how much you enjoy our work and tech communities, be it online or in real life.\n\nEmbracing inclusion requires all of us to be allies for those who face discrimination â€“ to fully understand and appreciate the diversity in individuals, and beyond mere appreciation, to truly act and make real change. There are many nuanced changes that you must all make to encourage more underrepresented groups to love creating technology and show the industry how to create an environment where they can excel.\n\nThis talk is a call to action. What can you do beyond diversifying the pipeline and offering diversity scholarships? How can you make everyone enjoy the party? In this SkillsCast, you'll discover the key to boosting inclusion in tech.\n\nWatch thousands more tech talks in our SkillsCast library at https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts"
