title: 'YOW! 2014 Andrei Alexandrescu - Cool Things about D – Why and how we use it at Facebook'
recordingDate: 1514388075
description: "There’s been a Cambrian explosion of new programming languages as of late, prompted by advances in programming languages research and practice and also by the advent of the modular backend LLVM.\n\nD is a serious contender in the systems-level programming area. It supports that claim by being good at everything C and C++ are good at, and also by being good at many tasks that C and C++ are not good at. D also has a compelling interoperability story that allows gradual migration and new modern code that reuses legacy libraries.\n\nThis talk is an introduction to D, with emphasis on a few differentiating features.\n\nAndrei Alexandrescu coined the colloquial term “modern C++” (adapted from his award-winning book Modern C++ Design), used today to describe a collection of important C++ styles and idioms. He is also the coauthor (with Herb Sutter) of C++ Coding Standards and the author of The D Programming Language book. With Walter Bright, Andrei co-designed many important features of D and authored a large part of D’s standard library. His research on Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing completes a broad spectrum of expertise. Andrei holds a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Washington and a BSc in Electrical Engineering from University “Politehnica” Bucharest. He works as a Research Scientist for Facebook.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
