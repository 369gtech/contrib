description: "This is an interview that Lex Fridman did of me about 2 years ago, then subsequently deleted. I'm pretty sure it's the only interview out of 614 that Lex has ever deleted. Recently, during my interview with Yannic Kilcher, I was reminded of it, Yannic explained how he learned a lot about my motives and personality from that interview. This was a time period for me where i was deeply attached/enslaved to the youtube algorithm and I think it'd be a disservice to the community not to see this piece of internet history. I asked Lex if i could release it and did not receive a reply. Then I asked twitter if i should release it and people clearly wanted it. So here it is in full; i hope this interview illuminates how i felt 2 years ago. \n\nLex's channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/lexfridman\n\nFollow me:\n\nINSTAGRAM:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/sirajraval/\n\nTWITTER:\nhttps://twitter.com/sirajraval\n\nFACEBOOK:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/sirajologyyy\n\nLINKEDIN:\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/sirajraval/\n\nPlease subscribe for more programming videos!
