description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2014.\nSpeaker: Fabrice Matrat\nEssential Grails Track\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/dive-into-spa-with-grails-and-rave-js\nSee how this server-side guy fell in love with client-side application development when he discovered that his years of Grails experience already taught him how to be a great JavaScript developer. We'll explore how advanced architectural libraries, such as cujoJS and RaveJS, provide parallels to many of the concepts you love in Grails."
