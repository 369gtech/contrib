description: "http://www.Cppcon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2015\n—\nDuring January 2015, Sean Parent posted a very interesting short piece of code on Twitter. The code iteratively iterates at compile-time over any number of function arguments, forwarding them one by one to a callable object.\n\nHow does this code work? What are the possible use cases? Can we make it even more generic and useful?\n\nMy talk answers all of the questions above, using independently compiled chronologically sequential code segments that show the audience the analysis and improvement process of `for_each_argument`.\n— \nVittorio Romeo is an Italian 20 year old Computer Science student at \"Università degli Studi di Messina\". \n\nHe began programming at a very young age and soon became a C++ enthusiast. While following the evolution of the C++ standard and embracing the newest features, he worked on several open-source projects, including modern general-purpose libraries and free cross-platform indie games.\n\nVittorio is an active member of the C++ community: he participated as a speaker at CppCon 2014, as a Student/Volunteer at C++Now 2015, as a speaker at Italian C++ Meeting 2015 and as a speaker at his local city's Linux Day 2013 and 2014 events.\n\nHe currently maintains a YouTube channel featuring well-received modern C++11 and C++14 tutorials.\n\nWhen he's not programming, Vittorio enjoys weightlifting and fitness-related activities, competitive/challenging computer gaming (CS:GO, Quake, LoL, Touhou, ...), and good sci-fi movies/tv-series (Firefly, Fringe, Futurama, ...).\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
