description: 'Join Nate Schutta and DaShaun Carter, a Partner Solution Architect for Redis Labs. A husband, father of four, volunteer and reluctant athlete. Deliberately practicing to build better software, faster. Generalist. Computer Science. MBA. Continuously learning. Believes that every rep counts. Doesnâ€™t have anything figured out. Still trying to prove to himself that the sacrifices that his parents made for him, were worth it. Trying to get a little better every day.'
