description: "MobileOptimized 2020, Online â€“ November 6-7, 2020\n\nAbsolute Modularization for Android, Stepan Goncharov\n\nOnce your project grows - Gradle starting to become a little baby who needs attention 24/7, often it's done by the whole team of experts.\n\nIn this talk, I'll tell you about the way to abstract complex build configurations and introduce limitations which would help developers to become experts in project structuring and scaling to hundreds or even thousands of modules, without sacrificing best practices for build speed.\n\nAnd the best thing about that approach - there is a ready to use framework, waiting for you to start using it."
