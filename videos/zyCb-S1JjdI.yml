description: "A quick introduction to the Rust Language. Code comparisons between Java and Rust, compiler features, type system, environment and integrating the two languages.\n\nTopics\n\nBrief History of Rust - how did the project get started, main goals, first stable releases.\nMain types and Functions - writing a very basic code and a deep comparison between Java style and Rust style. The level of verbosity is similar; however, the way you explicit the types may be different.\nStructs and Traits, contrasting them with Interfaces and Abstract Classes in Java.\nLifetime vs GC - how can we remove objects from the memory without a GC? An interesting alternative approach from Rust to Java's GC. We will show the good and the complicated parts.\nNotes about the compiler\n\nHanneli Tavante \nHanneli is a software developer. With experience in Java, C++ and Ruby, she works mostly with backend development and project architecture. She contributes to some open source projects and organises Cassandra, Science and Rust meetups in Sao Paulo. She enjoys spreading the knowledge and learning new topics in conferences around the globe. She also likes coffee, GIFs, Lego and Mathematics."
