title: 'YOW! West 2015 Eric Winkler - Maker Culture for the Enterprise Developer'
recordingDate: 1514638702
description: "The maker culture, it’s a place where minimum viable product simply isn’t cool enough, where manufacturer security holes are useful and where your skills as a developer are a membership card.\n\nLearn how to get started coding against the devices in your home and see how your existing developer skills and tools can be used to improve the way you interact with the physical world. We’ll dive into real world examples of bringing a residential A/C and a typical domestic wireless doorbell into the Internet of Things using a netduino and the .net microframework. Along the way we’ll discover some pitfalls for experienced developers and a heads up for dealing with the iGeneration prankster.\n\nEric comes from a background in building sell-side trading systems for the financial services sector. Nearly a decade in and now in the personal finance space, he’s still delivering software to help people move money around. A firm advocate of just enough process and good enough software, Eric finds excuses to chase interesting problems in and out of the office.\n\nFor more on YOW!
