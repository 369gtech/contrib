description: "Moscow Erlang Factory Lite 2012\n\nerlang-solutions.com\nerlang-factory.com\n\n\"So much flashy title is necessary - Peter plans to emphasize several current issues with Erlang and Linux distributions (packaging, building, dependency checking, etc). Many Erlang developers blame Linux distributions and Mac OS X package management systems for having outdated Erlang versions, not providing necessary libraries, etc, etc, etc.\n\nHe'd like to enlighten his fellow Erlangers about the current not-so-bad state, tell them a story behind that (with the historical parallels), outline current issues with popular methods and tools of the software delivery process, and predict some possible future developments.\"\n\nFollow us on Twitter @Erlangfactory twitter.com/#!/erlangfactory\nJoin our group on Linkedin Erlang Factory linkedin.com/groups/Erlang-Factory-2003110?trk=myg_ugrp_ovr"
