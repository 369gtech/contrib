description: "Higher-order functions such as map(), flatmap(), filter(), and reduce() have their origins in mathematics and ancient functional programming languages such as Lisp. But today they are well on their way to becoming an essential part of every Java and Scala developer’s toolbox. In this session, you will learn how these and other higher-order functions enable you to write simple, expressive, and concise code that solves problems in a diverse set of domains. The presentation describes how you can use them to process collections in Java and Scala. You will learn how functional Futures and Reactive Extensions (Rx) observables simplify concurrent code and how to write big data applications in a functional style with libraries such as Scalding.\n\n\nAuthor:\nChris Richardson\nChris Richardson is a developer and architect with over 20 years of experience.
