description: "Full title - Dr. Clément Walter: keras-fsl: Fast model builder for production ready few shot learning algorithms\n\nFew shot learning aims at leveraging huge database for training deep neural nets models to be used onto problems with very few data. Among other methods we will focus on metric learning algorithms because they allow for immediate adaptation of the model in production. To develop such model, fast experiment is key; we will present a versatile framework for their implementation in tf.keras.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
