description: "Nan Duan, research manager at Microsoft Research Asia is working in the field of Code Intelligence, which leverages AI to help software developers by developing large-scale pre-trained models for code and natural language. \n\nCodeBERT supports code-code, code-text, text-code and text-text transformations in six programming languages. With CodeBERT, developers can use code completion systems when questioning what to write next. If they come across an unfamiliar piece of code, they can access code summarization to see a natural language description of what the code actually does. CodeBERT also has code search systems that developers can use to locate code written by others with the same intent by using natural language queries. Finally, CodeBERT has the power to translate technical documentation into dozens of languages automatically.\n\nCodeBERT GitHub repository: https://github.com/microsoft/codebert\n\nLearn more about CodeXGLUE: https://github.com/microsoft/codexglue\n\nTo learn more about the latest Dev breakthroughs, visit the Innovation Tech Hub: https://innovation.microsoft.com/en-us/developer\n\nDiscover all the Innovation Tech Minutes for Developers: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrxD0HtieHjNJcVCIktce-wSFZ5svwA3"
