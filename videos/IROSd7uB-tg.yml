title: 'Writing simpler ASP.NET Core - Jonathan Channon'
recordingDate: 1535966096
description: "Ever since ASP.NET MVC came out in 2007 many developers have been involved in a cargo cult of writing web applications in a Controller-Service-Repository design. This has been repeated over and over for nearly 10 years. This design reinforces everything that the SOLID design pattern promotes but actually what is the effect of following this? Developers bring in large dependencies to support this design, add complexity to their applications and potentially cause a performance issue.\nWe'll go through various approaches to improve your web application design, one better than the last but arrive at a destination where you can simplify your architecture, simplify your code, remove dependencies, increase performance and use \"functional\" approaches in C# whilst still allowing you to write clean code that negates the need for IoC containers and mocks in your tests."
