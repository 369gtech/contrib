description: "Domain-Driven Design Europe 2018\nhttps://dddeurope.com/\nhttps://twitter.com/ddd_eu\n\nUltra-Large Scale Systems\n\nGovernments, City Planners, Social System Designers, and even the military recognize the need to understand ultra-large scale complex systems, because that is the future of software/systems development. This talk will briefly discuss the definition of ULS and why they differ from systems with which we are familiar; then it will identify five critical challenges posed by complex systems — e.g. the need to integrate human beings as computational components — and suggest practical approaches for dealing with all five.\n\nBIOGRAPHY\n\nDave West began his computing career as a Computer Operator / Programmer in 1968 — the same year that “Software Engineering” became a profession. He has participated in every movement and revolution in computing since then, including: structured development, databases- and data-driven development, object development, agile development, patterns, domain-driven design, and design thinking. He pursued simultaneous careers as a professional developer and academic. Today he provides mentoring, training, coaching, and consulting services to teams and organizations seeking transformative change."
