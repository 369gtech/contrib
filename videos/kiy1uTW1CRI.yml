description: "Ever wondered about the technology behind Google Photos? Or wanted to build a voice recognition app with similar functionality to \"Ok, Google\"? The Google Cloud Vision and Speech APIs expose the machine learning models that power Google Photos, Google Image Search and the speech recognition in Android. Developers can now access these features with just a simple REST API call. We’ll learn how to make requests to the Vision and Speech APIs through a live demo of a Node app that uses these machine learning APIs.\n\nSara Robinson is a Developer Advocate on Google's Cloud Platform team, where she helps with developer relations through online content, outreach and events. She has a bachelor’s degree in Business and International Studies from Brandeis University. When she's not programming, she can be found running, listening to country music, or finding the best ice cream in SF.\n\nMete Atamel\nI'm a Developer Advocate at Google, currently focused on helping developers with Google Cloud Platform. As a long-time Java and a recent C# developer, I like to compare the two ecosystems. Prior to Google, I worked at Microsoft, Skype, Adobe, EMC, and Nokia building apps and services on various web, mobile and cloud platforms. Originally from Cyprus, I currently live in Greenwich, not too far away from the prime meridian.\n\n[LZB-2365]"
