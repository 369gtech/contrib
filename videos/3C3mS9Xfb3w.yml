It sounds perfect but at the end of the day, who really pays for open source to meet the demands of quality code contributions and best of breed maintenance? In his keynote, Todd Moore explores this provocative question making the rounds in developer circles today and makes the case for open governance and enterprise contributions as the way forward. Learn about the best practices of open governance as well as the crucial importance of enterprise contributions to open source to drive quality code, deliver on maintenance needs and minimize overall risk for the community.\n\nFor more info click here: https://sched.co/FzEI"
