These targets are often measured by successful requests per second or 99th percentile latency. In order for this service to be considered resilient, it should attempt to reach these targets even when confronted with overload or failures in the rest of the system. The tools that engineers have typically employed to stop cascading failure, such as circuit breakers, are a poor fit for building services that can change to an ever-changing production system. What we’d like instead is for our services to protect themselves, protect each other, and react to failures without operator intervention.\n\nIn this talk, we’ll look at ways to build systems that can adapt to changes in latency, spikes in traffic, and systemic failures. In order to achieve our goals, we’ll discuss some basic queueing theory, congestion control algorithms, and how we can take advantage of these concepts in our systems.\n\nSlides & full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/chris-keathley/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - CHRIS KEATHLEY\nDynamic language apologist\n\nChris is a software engineer building services and applications for Bleacher Report. Although he started out writing C for embedded systems, these days he spends his time in Elixir, Haskell, Go, and Rust. When not writing code for work, Chris can be found writing code for fun, talking about the joys of functional programming, playing pinball, roasting coffee, or building Lego with his kids.\n\nMore on Chris Keathley: https://codesync.global/speaker/chris-keathley/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM V 2020\nCode BEAM V is powered by Code Sync.
