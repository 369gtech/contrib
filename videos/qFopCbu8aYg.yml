title: 'How We Do Cross Platform'
language: English
recordingDate: 1534702875
description: "For teams that deliver code for the web, android, and iOS, we want to avoid writing all of our logic three times, in three different languages, across three different platforms. We will share how our team was successful in developing features of our platform that realized 70% business logic code re-use between web and mobile and even more re-use between Android and iOS. We will discuss the motivations for when it is right to code-share, how to organize your React code and build configurations to accomplish code sharing, and how we approach integrating React components into native Android and iOS app.\n\nEVENT:\n\nChain React 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nRobert Scarano\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nConference Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.
