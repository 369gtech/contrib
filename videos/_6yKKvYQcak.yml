description: "Using a CRD to better integrate SPIRE and Kubernetes - Faisal Memon\n\nIn this talk we will discuss the Custom Resource Definition (CRD) for SPIRE we created. With the CRD we can better support automatic and manual generation of certificates, as well as integrate with kubectl.\n\nDon’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects."
