How can you know what will go wrong? Etsy's Front End Infrastructure team recently converted their codebase from CSS to SCSS and is moving from inlined javascript to structured AMD modules. In this talk, Sufian will teach you the pitfalls, strategies, and tools you can use to ensure that large sweeping changes across your codebase will go smoothly."
