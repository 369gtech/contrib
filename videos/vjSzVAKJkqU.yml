description: "O'Reilly's Mac Slocum speaks with Susan Sons, Senior Systems Analyst at the Center for Applied Cybersecurity Research at Indiana University. They discuss:\n\nWhy Susan gravitated toward security (it all started when she broke into a computer at four years old). (00:04)\n\nHer work to fix the Network Time Protocol (NTP), an essential part of the Internet's infrastructure. \"It was just a moment of panic,\" she said, recalling her first evaluation of the NTP. \"The Internet is going to fall down if I don't fix this.\" (01:53)\n\nHow the Internet's infrastructure can remain up to date and secure. (05:34)\n\nHow organizations can balance security with the need to move quickly. (09:43)\n\nThe single most important security issue we're facing is the battle between sound bites and first principles. (12:21)\n\nThe people and projects she's following. (16:49)\n\nSubscribe to O'Reilly on YouTube: http://goo.gl/n3QSYi\n\nFollow O'Reilly on \nTwitter: http://twitter.com/oreillymedia\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/OReilly\nGoogle: http://plus.google.com/+oreillymedia"
