title: '"Introducing Lambda Calculus with Python" - Indranil Ghosh (PyConline AU 2020)'
recordingDate: 1599606526
description: "Indranil Ghosh\n\nhttps://2020.pycon.org.au/program/AL8WB3\n\nWe will be focusing on untyped lambda calculus and start by the simple definition of a function, that can be implemented with Python lambda. We will then discuss the concepts of **abstraction** and **application** in lambda calculus and then move on to understand what a **substitution** is and how can these be implemented in Python. We will finally study some combinators which are the basic building blocks of combinatory logic, before ending with encoding datatypes in lambda calculus and implementing the same with Python lambda. Datatypes we will be discussing are:\r\n\r\n1. Boolean values like TRUE and FALSE\r\n2. Logical operators like AND, OR and NOT\r\n3. Church Numerals\r\n4. Predicates\r\n5. Recursions\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, PyConline\n\nSat Sep  5 14:40:00 2020 at Python 2"
