description: "A Practical Guide to Approach MicroService (MSA) Routing Tier for a Smooth Sail - Dilleswara Anupoju, Comcast \n\nFor more info: https://www.cloudfoundry.org/ \n\nWhatâ€™s the real challenge with the cloud-native apps (aka MSA -micro-services architecture) these days? The development & deployment of cloud-native /containerized apps is well covered with PaaS offerings such as cloud foundry and/or Kubernetes. These platforms enabled proliferation of these apps/services at a rate that it has reached a point, where the service discovery, routing has become a mesh(mess) of communication links; and yes we have been through asynchronous messaging models ESB, API Gateways, Edge proxies as well.\n\nIn this talk Dill Anupoju would like to present some of the challenges and key design factors to consider while building MSA and how they interact across multi-cloud/platforms environments; though there is no one solution that fits all."
