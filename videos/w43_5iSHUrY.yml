description: "Remote Debugging Java applications in Cloud Foundry - Subhankar Chattopadhyay & Shashank Mohan Jain, SAP\n\nDebugging code is a skill every developer should have or attain. Debugging a cloud based application before releasing to production has become extremely crucial. Can we leverage things like non breaking break points to debug code in cloud. Is it possible to allow a remote debugger to capture insights like variable states, stack states without having to disrupt the flow of the system. We propose to talk about this in context of Java applications and how remote debugging of java applications with non-breaking break points can be achieved. We discuss the Java Debugger Platform Architecture (JDPA) and its components like JVMTI, JDWP and JDI. Non-breaking breakpoints are a valuable component of remote debugging, as they provide all the necessary insights without disruptions to the running application. This proves useful especially when the target system is running in production.\n\nTo learn more about Cloud Foundry, The Proven Developer Experience For Kubernetes click here: https://www.cloudfoundry.org/"
