description: "Baruch Sadogursky, Developer Advocate, JFrog\n\nLeonid Igolnik, Vice President of Engineering, Service Management\n\nTransforming teams to DevOps at scale is an enormous topic spread across much research, many books, and years of better or worse implementations. In this interactive session, the audience can select topics such as tools, roles, on-call, RCA, metrics, and more and discuss some aspects of their successful implementation with the scientific DevOps maturity model. For each topic, there will be a discussion of the background, the requirements, the required actions, and the metrics of a successful implementation, and the session will cover as many topics as time allows."
