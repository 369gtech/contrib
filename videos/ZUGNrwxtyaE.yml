description: "Troubleshooting .NET Apps on Cloud Foundry - Matyukevich Sergey, Altoros\n\nWith Java applications pushed to Cloud Foundry, remote debugging is a piece of cake. With .NET applications, it’s a different story. Execution of the troubleshooting operations is barely possible with the Cloud Foundry platform as it is.\nIn this presentation, I’m going to share my experience of troubleshooting and debugging .NET applications pushed to Cloud Foundry and uncover the details of some generic operations that need to be performed on the Cloud Foundry platform for these ends. \n\nAbout Matyukevich Sergey\nSergey Matyukevich is Solutions Architect at Altoros. With 6+ years in software engineering, he is an expert in cloud automation and designing architectures for complex cloud-based systems. An active member of the Go community and a frequent contributor to open-source projects (Ubuntu, Juju Charms, etc.), Sergey has authored a series of popular blog posts on Golang internals. He has also designed and delivered a range of training courses on Cloud Foundry and cloud-native development for DevOps engineers, software developers, and architects."
