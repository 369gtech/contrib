recordingDate: 1612098433
description: "Jonathan Oxer, Andy Gelme\n\nhttps://lca2021.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/115/\n\nIs there anything more disappointing than getting a new gizmo and plugging it in only to discover it doesn’t work? We really didn’t want you to feel that way, so we tested components individually and again once each completed badge was assembled.\r\n\r\nLearn how we went about testing hundreds of badges in a time-effective manner, and hear a tale of failures found and quirks uncovered, and what we did to recover.\r\n\r\nWe’ll also give a wrapup for OHMC2021, the future for Swagbadge, our vision for Dagbadge and what we have in mind for the wider community.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/\n\nProduced by Next Day Video Australia: https://nextdayvideo.com.au\n\n#linux.conf.au #linux #foss #opensource\n\nSat Jan 23 17:05:00 2021 at Rusty R. Hall"
