title: 'Eric Pugh – How to measure Diversity of Search Results'
recordingDate: 1627376625
description: "Traditionally search has been all about \"how do I find the one (or five) documents that answer my question?\". However, what about when I want to encourage serendipity and discovery (common in research use cases)? In those cases, I care about increasing the diversity of my search results, while still ensuring the precision (i.e relevance) is decent. This talk will provide a simple formula for measuring your search results diversity (using Apache Zeppelin as a notebook), and offer some concrete tips on surfacing diverse search results.\n\nSpeaker: Eric Pugh – https://2021.berlinbuzzwords.de/member/eric-pugh\n\nMore: https://2021.berlinbuzzwords.de/session/how-measure-diversity-search-results"
