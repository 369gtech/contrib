description: "This will be a visual journey through a controversial topic: gender diversity in technology. Based on our personal experiences working as rara avis software engineers we will be discussing well-known myths and spread cliches - both good and bad - that we had to deal with.\n\nWhy is it so hard to have diverse teams, especially in tech and innovation? Is it because we are not able to improve diversity? Or because we donâ€™t know how to improve it? Or maybe, nobody wants to improve it at all?\n\nWe will analyze these questions and propose some actions to foster greater diversity, because we think, Diversity actually does matter!"
