description: "Google Tech Talks\r\nDecember 17, 2008\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nJoin one of Django's lead developers on a ride through Django's history. We'll start in Lawrence, Kansas and look at the birth of Django as a proprietary CMS, follow its progress towards the first open source release, and look at what's changed -- and what's stayed the same -- on the long road to Django 1.0.\r\n\r\nSpeaker: Jacob Kaplan-Moss\r\nJacob Kaplan-Moss is one of the lead developers of Django. At his day job, he's a software architect for Whiskey Media, one of those newfangled Web One-Point-Oh companies you've read so much about. A good deal of Jacob's work time is devoted to working on Django.\r\n\r\nJacob previously worked for the Lawrence Journal-World, a locally-owned newspaper in Lawrence, KS where Django was developed. At the Journal-World Jacob was the lead developer of Ellington, a commercial web publishing platform for media companies."
