description: 'Codemotion Milan 2015 - Payments and tech are intrinsically linked. Whether youâ€™re interacting with websites and desktop apps on your laptop, smartphone apps or NFC powered in-store terminals, or simple vending machines, payments are pervasive in every part of tech. This talk explores the payments landscape, and why this industry is becoming such a hotly competed battleground. We will discuss the challenges that face developers and entrepreneurs creating apps today, and how modern techniques like tokenization are revolutionising not only payments, but security and UX too.'
