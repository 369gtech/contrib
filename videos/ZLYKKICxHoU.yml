title: 'YOW! Data 2020 - Greg Roodt - Data Maturity Levels'
language: English
recordingDate: 1609291450
description: "At a startup, typically the main concern is survival. Advanced analysis techniques and machine learning is often a luxury or even a distraction from the prime directive - don't die. However, as a startup grows, the data requirements evolve and eventually the startup morphs into a larger company where data is a core competitive advantage that drives decision making and product features.\n\nIn this talk, I describe what this evolution looks like and provide a framework to evaluate the different data maturity levels that a company may be at. This framework can not only be applied to a growing company, it can also be applied to a team or department within an already established company.\n\nA Software Engineer and Startup Founder with experience building successful large-scale web and mobile applications. Passionate about creating products that customers love.\n\nSpecialties: Java, Scala, Python, Swift, Web, iOS, Android, Linux, AWS.\n\nFor more information on YOW!
