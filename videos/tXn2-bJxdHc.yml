Query and schema tuning is tough enough by itself. But queries, buried many call levels deep in PL/pgSQL functions, make it torture. The reason is that the default monitoring tools like logs, pg_stat_activity and pg_stat_statements cannot penetrate into PL/pgSQL. All they report is that your query calling function X is slow. That is useful if function X has 20 lines of simple code. Not so useful if it calls other functions and the actual problem query is many call levels down in a dungeon of 100,000 lines of PL code. Learn from the original author of PL/pgSQL and current maintainer of the plprofiler extension how you can easily analyze, what is going on inside your PL code."
