description: "Slides: https://speakerdeck.com/han/sometimes-you-need-to-draw-animals\nIn 2011 I quit my job at Last.fm, clinging to what was left of my ability to make things -- which, at the time, wasn't a hell of a lot. Since then, I've spent the majority of my personal time working on this as a design problem. Not just fixing what was broken, but redesigning the architecture to prevent it from happening again.\n\nAs makers, burnout is something we all face. It might be big, it might small. Mine was pretty big. This is the story I'm going to tell you.\n\nSource: http://2013.jsconf.eu/speakers/hannah-donovan-sometimes-you-need-to-draw-animals.html\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
