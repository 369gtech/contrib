description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2012\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nKasper Lund - Google V8 Team and Dart Team\n\nABSTRACT\nDart is a new programming language for the web. To make Dart run in all modern browsers, we have implemented an optimizing Dart-to-JavaScript compiler. Performance-wise the biggest challenge is the gap between the semantics of Dart's low-level operators and JavaScript's builtin primitives. This presentation will introduce you to the Dart language and the deployment options before diving into the details of the intermediate representation and the implemented optimizations.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
