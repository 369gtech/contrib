description: "What Does It Take to Run Cloud Foundry at Enterprise Scale? - Josh Stone, Verizon    \n\nAs a Fortune 15 company, Verizon is big. Really big. Over 10,000 developers, 3000 applications big. What does it take to offer Cloud Foundry to a development community that big? How do you run/upgrade/support a dozen independent foundations all over the US? Josh will share the Cloud Foundry story at Verizon, how Cloud Foundry fits into a Fortune 15 IT cloud strategy, and operations lessons learned that can be applied at any scale.\n\nJosh Stone\nCloud & API Architect, Verizon"
