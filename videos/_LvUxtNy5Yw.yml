recordingDate: 1191898258
description: "Google Tech Talks\nMarch 7, 2007\n\nABSTRACT\n\nUntil a recent upswing, developing and transition economies outside East and South Asia did not have sustained per capita income growth after the 1970s, nor any observable structural economic change. The Asian economies to a greater or lesser extent pursued developmentalist economic polices; the others undertook market liberalization as suggested by the World Bank and IMF. How all countries may be able to improve their growth performance through sensible policy choices is the pressing issue at hand. If they don't, extreme poverty worldwide will not be reduced.
