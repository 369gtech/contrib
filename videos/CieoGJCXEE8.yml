description: "Deploying your Java application in a Kubernetes cluster could feel like Alice in Wonderland. You keep going down the rabbit hole and donâ€™t know how to make that ride comfortable. This no-slide and code-only session will explain how a Java application can be deployed in a Kubernetes cluster. Specifically, it will explain the following:\n\n- Package the application as Docker image\n- Create Kubernetes manifests\n- Create Helm charts\n- Test in a local k8s cluster\n- Debug pods using Java IDE\n- Observability using Istio\n- Canary and A/B testing\n- Migrate application from dev to prod environments\n- Deployment pipeline on desktop and in the cloud"
