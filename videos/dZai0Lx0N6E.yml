description: "Content strategy plans for the creation, publication, and governance of useful, usable content and\_User Experience is basically everything that users feel or think while interacting with a product, which doesnâ€™t necessarily need to be a digital one.\n\nThough user experience and content strategy seem to have similar goals there is too much conflict when it comes to the actual execution. There are often battles between UX and content management teams, especially when it comes to design process. Content strategists and SEO specialists tend to add as much keyword optimized content to webpages as possible, while designers have a hard time fitting that 400-500 word content into the page without impacting the design.\n\nwhen user experience and content strategy work together, the synergistic effect is much greater than simply resolving conflict. Combining the expertise, skills and mindsets of usability professionals, creative designers, content curators and strategists will not only solve existing problems but will improve the overall communication between them.\n\nIdeally, such brainstorming sessions will help to\_create a clear vision of the product both from UX and content perspective.\n\nIn this session we will learn about:\n\nWhat Exactly Is Content Strategy?\nCore strategy\nStructure\nWorkflow\nGovernance\_\nwhat user stories are and \_how to map user flows.\nHow Does Content Strategy Relate to UX Design\nHow Can Content Strategy Benefit From UX.\nClarity and Readability\nBetter Information Architecture\nFocus on the user\nConversion Optimization\nThe difference between templates and content types.\nHow to prototype with proto-content (and why).\nHow to user test your content."
