description: "Whatever paradigm, language, technology stack or devops strategy we use, we will always write code. And that code will need to be understood, maintained and evolved by various developers for many years, hopefully. It will be read 10x more time than it took to write it!\n\nThen, tell me, how do you write your code ?\n\nStop rushing, and start writing professional code. You'll need to learn to introspect your design, to make it express your thoughts in code. It may take years of practice to reach that point, but the path starts with some basic guidelines and 'code smells' that you ought to know, along with a core toolset of refactoring techniques.\n\nAs simple as some of these might seem, they will become the starting point of a lot of discussions about core principles of good software design, such as DRY, SRP, DIP, and KISS. Come and enjoy an entertaining, tangible presentation of key concepts in Clean Code, that will allow you to easily coach others, back at work.\n\nLooking forward to share my passion with you: writing expressive code that is a pleasure to work with.\n\nPS: In the end, let's talk a bit about writing clean code using Java8 lambdas/Streams, shall we? :)\n\nVictor Rentea\nJava Craftsman. Sr. Engineer & Technical Lead at IBM. Independent Trainer & Coach. I worked on backend systems over the last 10 years, solving challenges of a broad range of enterprise Java applications as a developer, lead and consultant. 4 years ago I joined the ‘coding craftsmanship’ move, and soon after I started preaching about it as an independent trainer/coach. For hundreds of days I’ve trained more than 1000 trainees in all kinds of settings (including academic), usually bundled with other training modules in my curricula. My experience as a trainer allowed me to refine a very entertaining presentation style, spiced with jokes, non-IT-world analogies, and examples that is able to convey even the most complex ideas"
