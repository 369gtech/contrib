title: '#HITBGSEC COMMSEC: Exploiting Zoom On MacOS - Michael Gianarakis and Sean Yeoh'
language: English
recordingDate: 1569841055
description: "Early this year we were participating in a bug bounty event in Singapore that had Zoom in scope. Always wanting to hack on a web conferencing tool we started looking at the clients on the flight. Two days later we had RCE.\n\nThis presentation will walk through our journey reverse engineering the macOS Zoom client and discovering a serious flaw that would result in zero interaction remote code execution. This bug would have been possible to exploit on a large scale remotely via the web.\n\nWe will detail a number of processes and tools we use to reverse engineer Objective-C apps and common techniques to exploit macOS apps that can be applied across a number of applications beyond Zoom\n\n=======\n\nMichael Gianarakis is the co-founder and CEO of Assetnote, a platform for continuous monitoring of your external attack surface. Michael has presented his research at various industry events including DEF CON, Black Hat Asia, Thotcon, Rootcon and Hack in the Box. Michael is also actively involved in the local security community in Australia where he is one of organizers of the monthly SecTalks meetup as well as the hacker camp TuskCon.\n\n-------\n\nSean Yeoh is the Lead Architecture and DevOps engineer at Assetnote, ensuring that the build is continuously broken and logging of the engine is too verbose. Sean previously participating religiously in CTFs as part of his University CTF team, winning the past two Cyber Security Challenge Australia CTFs. He lectures Advanced Web Application Security and Software Security Assessment (Formerly 9447) at UNSW and spends his free time doing bug bounties and wrangling kubernetes."
