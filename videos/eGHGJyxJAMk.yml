description: "Speaker: Tan Li Hau\ngithub: @tanhauhau\ntwitter: https://twitter.com/lihautan\n\n\"Hi, I'm Li Hau. Frontend Engineer at Shopee. I like to create bugs and fix them. Recently I am trying to write down my learnings and thought processes in my blog https://lihautan.com/. Also, I am currently a maintainer of Svelte, hopefully it meant less bug for Svelte.\"\n\nAbout the talk:\nHow does Svelte work? How is Svelte different from other modern frameworks? Why compile? Don't worry, I'll explain what is Svelte, how it works, and I promise you can fit all of that into your head.\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/Singapore-JS/events/273131240/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\r\nRecorded by: Michael"
