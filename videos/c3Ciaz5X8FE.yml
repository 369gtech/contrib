title: 'Top Ten Worst Repositories to host on GitHub - Carlos Mart√≠n Nieto'
recordingDate: 1506326677
description: "At GitHub we host a large number of wildly different projects and are the de-facto destination for many people. This means we see a lot of different use-cases come through our services. Sometimes it's the shape of the data, sometimes its size, sometimes it's an unexpected combination of both for a novel use-case that makes it harder to host.\n\nIn this talk we'll see how GitHub has developed projects like Spokes and Lariat to make sure we can host these Git repositories reliably, from replication and heuristics to caching and application of quotas, they help make sure a project with over-eager CI systems or expensive Git processing requirements does not endanger the overall reliability of the system."
