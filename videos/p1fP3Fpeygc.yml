title: 'Four Languages from Forty Years Ago - Scott Wlaschin'
recordingDate: 1550582707
description: "The 1970's were a golden age for new programming languages, but do they have any relevance to programming today? Can we still learn from them?\n\nIn this talk, we'll look at four languages designed over forty years ago -- SQL, Prolog, ML, and Smalltalk -- and discuss their philosophy and approach to programming, which is very different from most popular languages today.\n\nWe'll come away with some practical principles that are still very applicable to modern development. And you might discover your new favorite programming paradigm!\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
