recordingDate: 1538644250
description: "The network is back. But is it useful?\n\nWe’ll explore what a service mesh is and what they can do for your microservice web backends. Are the claims of observability, resiliency, and WAF features real? Are they useful during development, production, or both? Using pictures and demos, we’ll find out!\n\nThis session will also briefly cover how a service mesh works, giving us a mental model with which to explore and evaluate after the talk. Matt will show a simple installation and demo, giving us all the knowledge to go home and try for ourself."
