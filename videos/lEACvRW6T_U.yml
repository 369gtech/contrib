This deep dive session will go in detail currently ongoing efforts happening within SIG Instrumentation to share with the audience concrete pieces of work to encourage future collaboration. Specifically, we go into our ongoing efforts with the Kubernetes metrics stability framework and discuss our current exploration into adding distributed tracing to Kubernetes objects and their lifecycles. Software engineering and operations are both disciplines practiced in SIG Instrumentation, and any experience will help the special interest group's mission. Join this session to learn how to get involved in SIG Instrumentation to make instrumentation even better! \n\nhttps://sched.co/Uagv"
