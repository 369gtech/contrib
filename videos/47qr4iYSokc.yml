description: "This video was recorded at the Erlang factory Lite in Munich on 19 Feb. More details and slides here: http://www.erlang-factory.com/conference/Munich2013/speakers/AlvaroVidela\n\n\nRabbitMQ is a Messaging and Queueing server that works with the AMQP protocol. But what happens if we want to use the server beyond AMQP? What if we want to replace its own storage engine or provide new authentication methods? All of that can be done why writing new plugins for RabbitMQ in Erlang.\n\nIn this talk we are going to present various plugins for RabbitMQ and we will show how to extend the broker by adding new routing algorithms with custom exchange types. The code examples will be in Erlang."
