description: "Spring I/O 2018 - Barcelona, 24-25 May\n\nGitHub repo: https://github.com/AxonIQ/giftcard-demo-series\n\nEvents are becoming increasingly important in modern architectures. Although CQRS and Event Sourcing are increasingly being adopted, the complexity of implementing it is often highly over-estimated.\n\nIn this session, we will first briefly cover what CQRS and Event Sourcing are, and how it addresses some common requirements that modern applications have.\n\nNext, we will open up the IDE and see how Spring Boot and Axon Framework work neatly together to get you up and running with Event Sourcing in mere minutes.\n\nOnce we have the application running, we will use Spring Cloud Discovery to scale the application out, where Axon will ensure optimal routing of commands. We will also see how we can easily use Spring AMQP to publish all events to an AMQP message queue as well."
