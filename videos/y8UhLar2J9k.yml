language: English
recordingDate: 1526149506
description: "WebAssembly (WASM) represents a potential sea change in the JavaScript world. But what is it? Will it replace JavaScript? Can it make my code magically faster? In this session we'll cover all the basics of WASM. We'll discuss what WASM is, how it interfaces with JavaScript and how to use it. First, we'll cover WASM at a high level and walk through its binary and textual representation. Second, we'll see how it interfaces with JavaScript by seeing calls to and from WASM modules. Third, we'll build a WASM module using wasm-init and C++. WASM holds immense potential for many different applications. Developers will leave the session understanding how WASM could fit into their application and have the knowledge necessary to implement it.\n\nEVENT:\n\nNodeJS Interactive 2017\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nPaul Milham, WildWorks\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nThe Linux Foundation provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk9ERa7UYPM"
