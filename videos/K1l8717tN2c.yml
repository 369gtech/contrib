recordingDate: 1433260392
description: "Your continuous integration system is well oiled and kicks in after every commit. Your code is compiled. Your tests are green. You feel ready to take your project to the next level and move to continuous delivery. This transition can be rough and comes with new challenges. This session looks at five essential pillars of software architecture that will make it a success: environment detection, autoconfiguration, database migrations, feature toggles, and state management. By the end of the session, you’ll have a solid understanding of what it takes to build applications that can be delivered reliably into production multiple times a day with zero downtime.\n\n\nAuthor:\nAxel Fontaine\nundefined\nView more trainings by Axel Fontaine at https://www.parleys.com/author/axel-fontaine-3\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
