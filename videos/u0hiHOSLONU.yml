description: "Hasjim 'futaris' Williams\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/214/\n\nThis talk aims to run through some basic kernel code and documentation and the norms of upstreaming a linux kernel driver.\r\n\r\nThe examples used within this talk, will be from LiteX. LiteX is a FPGA design/SoC builder that can be used to build cores, create SoCs and full FPGA designs.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n#linux.conf.au #linux #foss #opensource\n\nTue Jan 14 14:50:00 2020 at Arena"
