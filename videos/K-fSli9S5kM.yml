title: 'Machine Learning for Software Developers (...and Knitters) - Kris Howard - NDC Melbourne 2021'
language: English
recordingDate: 1628503206
description: "Advances in AI/ML tooling make it possible for anyone - not just data scientists - to create models that identify business risks, carry on conversations, drive cars, optimise vaccines, and even create art.\n\nIn this session Kris will give an overview of the state of AI/ML and some of its more creative applications, as well as a few services AWS has developed to make it easier to get started. Then sheâ€™ll dive deep into a demo application she built: an attempt to teach a computer to reverse engineer knitting patterns, in her evolving quest to build the world's first knitting replicator. (Yes, really.)"
