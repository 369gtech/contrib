She knows there is more to wellness than organic apples and kale and teaches people the power of fitness + movement for it's mental benefits and not just a 6-pack.\r\nShe can be found over at kimberlyweiss.com.\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/fuckup-nights-singapore-vol-xvi-tickets-34272425748\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/7hEo/"
