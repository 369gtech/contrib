description: 'Golang is a pretty nifty language, and it''s remarkably well suited for car hacking. SocketCAN provides a great framework for interacting with CAN devices, so why not use it from Go? We''ll present an open source Go library for making SocketCAN easy, and show how to work with raw CAN and ISOTP data. Attendees will get all the info they need to start hacking CAN buses with Go.'
