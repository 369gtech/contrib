recordingDate: 1474885715
description: "Slides and more info: http://www.erlang-factory.com/euc2016/lukas-larsson\n\nTracing is a crucial part of any Erlang developer's tools. Unfortunately it can sometimes be difficult to figure out how to use it properly and without negatively impacting the system you are tracing. In Erlang/OTP 19 and forwards a number of improvements will be made to the way tracing is done in Erlang that will increase flexibility and throughput while decreasing the overhead of tracing. This talk will describe what is currently provided by the Erlang run-time system and what the future will bring.\n\nTalk objectives:\n\nGive a greater understanding of what is possible to do with Erlang tracing and also an overview of the features that are to be added in Erlang/OTP 19.0 and forward.\n\nTarget audience:\n\nAnyone who has ever used the Erlang tracer."
