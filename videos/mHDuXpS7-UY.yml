description: "Knative Eventing provides composable primitives to connect event sources to event consumers on Kubernetes.\n\nCloud Run is its managed cousin on Google Cloud. In this demo-driven talk, we'll start with basics of Knative and Cloud Run Eventing. We then continue with more advanced eventing topics. At the end of this talk, you'll have a solid understanding of Knative and Cloud Run Eventing and how they can help build event-driven architectures.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks at: \nhttps://ndcoslo.com\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/"
