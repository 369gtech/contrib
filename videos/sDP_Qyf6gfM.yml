description: "The Internet is full of articles about how to build & lead tech teams, however reading these will only get you so far. In order to become a successful tech lead, you must also know how to manage people, including clients, project teams, other colleagues and your bosses.\n\nBut guess what, every single one of these people is individual and yet consistently we try to apply blanket rules to their ‘type’ and consider our people management skills complete. In this presentation, as well as explaining how he personally recruits and manages teams, Sam also posits that we should increase our awareness of the specific differences in people and adjust our views and behaviours accordingly when it comes to managing and working with other human beings.\n\n\nAbout Sam Barnes\n\nSam is the Development Team Manager at Venntro. Although a little short for a Stormtrooper, he can be found writing at thesambarnes.com, a blog dedicated to digital project and team management."
