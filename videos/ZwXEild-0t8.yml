description: "Pushpay is a payments company and recently came 1st in the Deloitte Fast 50 for NZ's fastest growing companies for having a revenue growth of over 4,500%, and also came 10th in the Technology Fast 500 Asia Pacific. We did this by constantly evolving our product, and by deploying to production up to a dozen times a day.\nThis talk will explain how we can do that consistently, and how we can maintain a high quality codebase with minimal technical debt. We will discuss the culture that enables this, detailing our blameless postmortem process that underpins everything we do, and that enables us to easily recover when things do go wrong. Finally we will cover some of the tools we've written that help keep our working environment safe.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcsydney.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
