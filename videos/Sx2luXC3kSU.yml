recordingDate: 1554371182
description: "Wouldn't it be nice if the orchestration platform handled authentication between your containerized services for you? And what if it also handled encrypting the communication?\nJoin this talk to see how we can use out-of-process architecture with istio can add end-to-end-encryption and authentication between kubernetes/openshift containers without touching the application at all. We can even use it to add encryption and authentication to third-party applications that don't support it, such as a nosql databases.\n\nWe will go through what Istio is and what it provides, and then dive into what istio actually does to provide authentication and encryption and what the benefits and limitations are.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nwww.ndcconferences.com\nhttps://ndc-security.com"
