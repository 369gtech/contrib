title: 'Leaving Javaland - bring your boots! Spring-Boot for Groovy developers'
recordingDate: 1543661697
description: 'Every Groovy developer knows Grails. But how many have peeked under the covers and looked into the underlying Spring-Boot framework? And did you ever consider writing your applications directly with Spring-Boot?This talk demonstrates how to leverage Spring-Boots’s built-in Groovy support for writing small and concise Microservice sas an alternative to Grails. We’ll also take a look into the Spring-Boot ecosystem and explore projects and features such as Spring-Data (for persistence and ORM), Spring-Web-MVC and Spring-Web-Reactive. As a deep dive, we’ll also delve into Spring-Boot’s underlying IoC container and DI mechanism, giving you a much better understanding of Grails’ core.'
