Type theory exploits the advantages of static typing to the limit, meaning that by hiding implementation details you can identify tow object which behave the same - this is called the univalence principle.\n\nRead the full abstract: http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2019/thorsten-altenkirch\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - THORSTEN ALTENKIRCH\nUniversity of Nottingham\n\nThorsten Altenkirch is a Professor of Computer Science at the University of Nottingham known for his research on logic, type theory, and homotopy type theory. Altenkirch was part of the 2012/2013 special year on univalent foundations at the Institute for Advanced Study. At Nottingham he co-chairs the Functional Programming Laboratory with Graham Hutton.\n\nMore on Thorsten Altenkirch: http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2019/thorsten-altenkirch\n\n---\n\nLAMBDA DAYS & ERLANG SOLUTIONS\nLambda Days is powered by Erlang Solutions.
