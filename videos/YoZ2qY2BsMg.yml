title: 'Tanzu Tuesdays - 15 Factor Applications on Kubernetes with DaShaun Carter'
language: English
recordingDate: 1597257074
description: "Perhaps you have heard of 12-factor apps, cloud-native, or 15-factor apps. Maybe you have wondered if cloud-native was right for you. In this session we will explore how to deliver apps using this methodology on Kubernetes. We will start by explaining the 15-factors. We will also review the cloud native features that are built into Kubernetes. Then we will create a new application, for Kubernetes, and demonstrate how to make it “15 factor cloud native on Kubernetes” !\n\n===\n\nDaShaun is a Tanzu Solutions Engineer for VMware, with over twenty years experience, trying to build better software faster. A husband, father of four, volunteer and reluctant athlete. DaShaun also helps organize DevOpsDaysKC and Cloud Foundry KC."
