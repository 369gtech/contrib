description: "Gartner estimates that during the next few years, 50% of all of enterprise IT organisations will have hybrid half-cloud half-on-premise deployment, and that by 2019 30% of the software will be cloud-only. For software quality, of course, this creates a challenge. Companies no longer control all the hardware or the data. There are many more assumptions in play. The industry is moving away from expensive kits that rarely break, to virtualised improvised magicked-up systems running on commodity hardware and likely to blow up at any time. This completely changes the risk profile for software architectures and tests. Gojko Adzic will help you navigate this swamp and create a winning testing strategy for cloud deployments.\n\nGojko Adzic is a strategic software delivery consultant who works with ambitious teams to align software delivery with business goals, and improve the quality of their software products and processes. Gojko specialises in are agile and lean quality improvement, in particular impact mapping, agile testing, specification by example and behaviour driven development.\n\nGojkoâ€™s book Specification by Example won the Jolt Award for the best book of 2012. In 2011, he was voted by peers as the most influential agile testing professional, and his blog won the UK Agile Award for the best online publication in 2010.\n\nGojko is a frequent keynote speaker at leading software development conferences, and one of the authors of MindMup.\n\nFor more information on YOW!
