recordingDate: 1519695820
description: "Join us for a discussion of web standards that are in development or just coming to maturity as we strive to both increase our own understanding and abilities and help standards orgs shape the future of the web, from the ground up.\n\nThis month, Pittsburgh's own Lin Clark will be presenting WebAssembly. Lin makes code cartoons. She's also part of Mozilla’s Emerging Technologies group, where she works with the WebAssembly and Rust teams. Her current project is making it easy to use WebAssembly with today's JavaScript tools, including npm and bundlers. In previous lives, she worked at npm, was a core contributor to open source projects like Firefox’s developer tools, and contributed to HTML data standards.\n\nWebAssembly is fast. It’s being called “the future of the web”. It’s speed and potential have major browser vendors working together to make it a reality. And it’s here—it was enabled in all browsers last year. But what makes it fast? Starting from the basics, this talk will walk you through what WebAssembly is, and then why it’s fast."
