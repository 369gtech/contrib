description: "by Arjan Scherpenisse\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/AW1.121/beam_keep_calm_use_nerves.webm\n\nIntended as a introduction to Nerves, the IoT platform for the BEAM, this talk is a journey through the land of library ecosystems, device drivers and pixel manipulators, in search for the holy grail: a stable and maintainable IoT device. The Nerves project (https://nerves-project.org/) is a framework for building IoT devices with Elixir. In this talk I will explain how a Nerves project is structured and then move on to show and demonstrate one of the projects that I did with it, focussing on the development experience and the state of the Nerves ecosystem. \n\nRoom: AW1.121\nScheduled start: 2020-02-01 11:00:00"
