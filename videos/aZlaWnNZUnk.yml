title: 'CERN Private Java Cloud: Deep Dive into On-Demand PaaS Internals'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433253710
description: "The Java ecosystem has changed since CERN was honored with the Duke's Choice Award, in 2008. Nowadays developers look beyond the limits of the application servers and want to exploit all the capabilities of the cloud. To respond to this demand, the CERN IT department started the Agile Infrastructure Project in 2011. The goal of this project is to provide an efficient and flexible infrastructure service that enables applications to exploit increased capacity and multisite facilities with the current manpower resources. This session shows how the Java infrastructure at CERN has evolved from a dispersed group of application servers to a consolidated Java platform as a service (PaaS) that matches the agile infrastructure vision.\n\n\nAuthor:\nLuis Rodriguez\nIt has being a while since Luis wrote his first \"Hello World\" in Java. He has spent most part of his career developing portals and web applications. But thanks to CERN he is discovering the joys of \"devops\". Recently he has started to post in the \"Databases at CERN blog\" (http://db-blog.web.cern.ch/). He has also been speaker at the UK Oracle User Group.\nView more trainings by Luis Rodriguez at https://www.parleys.com/author/luis-rodriguez-1\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
