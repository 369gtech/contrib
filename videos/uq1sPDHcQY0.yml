title: 'Rails Online Conf: Getting up-to-date with Rails 3'
recordingDate: 1268595160
description: 'Rails 3 is a lot of things. It includes a rewrite of ActionController, Railties, and the underpinnings of ActionMailer and ActiveRecord. It extracts the core parts of ActionController and ActiveModel for reuse by plugin developers. And it makes every Rails framework a plugin, so extension authors can easily replace ActiveRecord, ActionMailer or ActiveResource, leaving nary a trace of the old frameworks behind. In other words, there''s a lot to catch up on. Yehuda will go through the important high-level changes, giving you a starting point for digging into the improvements the Rails team has made for Rails 3.'
