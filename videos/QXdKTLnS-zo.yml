description: "Which IDE do you use for Java development? Eclipse? NetBeans? IntelliJ IDEA? Do you know what its most powerful features are? Generally, developers stick to one IDE and configure it to match their daily programming needs. They don’t consider a different IDE, not really being aware of what they’re missing. Because comparing apples with oranges doesn’t make sense, let’s instead look at what the key problems are that each IDE tries to solve. Is a hybrid development environment imaginable, where each IDE is available? This session doesn’t do a  shoot-out.  It shows you what makes each IDE unique, in turn, and what specific problems it tries to solve. And hopefully you’ll attend the session and share your experiences.\n\n\nAuthors:\nAnton Arhipov\nJRebel (@jrebel) product junkie @ ZeroTurnaround, vim fan and IntelliJ addict http://linkd.in/aarhipov\nView more trainings by Anton Arhipov at https://www.parleys.com/author/anton-arhipov\n\nMax Andersen\nundefined\nView more trainings by Max Andersen at https://www.parleys.com/author/max-andersen\n\nGeertjan Wielenga\nGeertjan Wielenga is a NetBeans product manager working at Oracle, focused on Java development and HTML5 development with NetBeans IDE and the NetBeans Platform.
