description: "Speaker: Jon Schneider, Pivotal\n\nMicrometer is an open source metrics collection facade, the default metrics implementation in Spring Boot 2.0 and above. Think SLF4J—but for metrics! In this talk, we'll examine why you should be instrumenting your applications with a dimensional collector like Micrometer. \n\nWe'll cover patterns for effectively monitoring key pieces of your application, from request latency to process and system-level metrics. Demos will highlight the strengths of a variety of Micrometer's 12 supported monitoring systems. \n\nYou’ll leave this webinar with Grafana dashboard templates to monitor the most critical metrics against Prometheus, Datadog, and Influx with some pre-configured alerts."
