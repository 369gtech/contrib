recordingDate: 1499345587
description: "JRuby is emerging as one of the most interesting language implementations on top of the JVM. Together with Groovy, Scala and Clojure, it is changing the way people are using and combining languages together with the Java platform.The Ruby language is beautiful, powerful and extremely malleable. By using Ruby on top of the the JVM it is possible to create the most combinations of languages, principles, paradigms and libraries.This presentation will introduce and explore JRuby, by first looking at its place in the Ruby ecosystem and then rapidly explore the many possibilities a life on the JVM gives. JRuby can be used as an excellent platform for polyglot programming, and can take your project to the nextlevel. But it can also be lots of fun. Doesn't that sound like winning?\n\nOla Bini works as a language geek for ThoughtWorks in Chicago. He is from Sweden but don't hold that against him. He is one of the JRuby core developers and have been involved in JRuby development since 2006. At one point in time, Ola got tired of all existing programming languages and decided to create his own, called Ioke. Then he did it again, and started work on Seph. He has written a book called Practical JRuby on Rails Projects for APress, and coauthered Using JRuby for the Pragmatic Programmers, talked at numerous conferences, and contributed to a large amount of open source projects. He is also a member of the JSR292 Expert Group.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
