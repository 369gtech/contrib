description: "Recording brought to you by American Express. https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs\nKotlin is a marvelous language that makes programming on the JVM fun again. During the design phase of the language, it was said that Kotlin specifically tried to avoid some of the most famous Java Puzzlers. However, having so many advanced features in the language it cannot avoid introducing puzzlers of its own. This talk will present some of the more interesting nuances of syntax or language features with the help of small puzzler programs letting the audience guess their behavior. The mystery will then be revealed with an explanation in a fun way.\n\nHaving received an overwhelmingly good feedback from two previous years, I am ready with a set of completely new puzzlers to entertain you again among all these really serious talks!\n\nResources:\nKotlinConf website: https://jb.gg/fyaze5\nKotlinConf on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlinconf\n\nKotlin website: https://jb.gg/pxrsn6\nKotlin blog: https://jb.gg/7uc7ow\nKotlin on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlin\n\n#KotlinConf19 #Kotlin #JetBrains\n\nAbout the Presenter:\nAnton Keks is a software craftsman, co-founder of Codeborne, the only extreme programming shop in the region, frequent speaker at conferences, and a lecturer in Tallinn Technical University.
