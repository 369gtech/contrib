title: 'What''s NOT new in modular Java by Milen Dyankov'

description: "With Java 9 and Jigsaw project around the corner (this time apparently for real), we finally need to stop pretending we can simply ignore the concept of modularity in Java! The thing is - modularity is NOT just some new framework! Neither it is a simple set of APIs! It's a complex concept that has been around for almost as long as the industry itself. So in this talk I'd like to take a step back and reason about the fundamental idea of modularity in Java by comparing the concepts of Jigsaw with other Java modularity approaches and implementations that have been around for quite some time.\n\nMilen Dyankov is senior consultant at Liferay helping some of the biggest European companies succeed in today's rapidly changing virtual reality by engaging their customers, partners, and employees. Before joining Liferay in 2012 he spent over 10 years designing and developing Java EE solutions for leading Polish companies (mostly in the finance and telecommunications industry). His main areas of competence include corporate portals, modular systems, e-commerce, enterprise application integration, web applications for mobile devices and many more!\n\n[UTP-8686]"
