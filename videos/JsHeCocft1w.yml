language: English
recordingDate: 1573833571
description: "About:\nYour frontend developers are pushing to get started with GraphQL, but you don't have the backend capacity to migrate your existing REST APIs to GraphQL? Or you want to have a GraphQL API next to your existing endpoints that are based on REST? In this talk, I'll show how to create a Node.js/Express server that wraps existing REST APIs into one single GraphQL endpoint, while also keeping security in mind. \nRoy Derks, CTO, SwitchBay\n\nRoy Derks is a developer/founder from Amsterdam, who works mainly on React applications. Both at his own startup SwitchBay and the City of Amsterdam, where all projects are open-sourced. In his \"free\" time he likes to share his knowledge with the JavaScript community on Twitter and during meetups and conferences. #javascriptEverywhere!"
