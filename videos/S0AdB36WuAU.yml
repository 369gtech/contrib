description: "When designing an API, how do you restrict your users to your public interface and keep their filthy hands off your internal implementation details? Sadly, the richness of Python's runtime makes this remarkably difficult. This talk investigates a number of ways to keep the riff-raff out and discusses the limitations of these techniques and how they can improve API designs.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
