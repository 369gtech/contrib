description: "Everyone seems to be talking about Kubernetes with companies seemingly tripping over themselves to support or adopt it.\n\nIn this talk we'll introduce Kubernetes, discuss the key concepts of the platform, it's high level architecture and how to get a Kubernetes cluster up and running in minutes in Azure. \n\nWe'll talk about and demo deploying .NET applications to Kubernetes and we'll finish with a discussion of the future where you can deploy both legacy and modern .NET applications to the same platform.\n\nIf you're interested in Kubernetes and you're not a .NET developer this session still has something for you.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndcminnesota.com/"
