description: "In this talk, we'll explore these problems and see how Domain Driven Design helps grapple with the domain complexity. We'll see how DDD concepts like Entities and Aggregates help reason about boundaries based on use cases and how transactions are affected. Once we can identify our transactional boundaries we can more carefully adjust our needs from the CAP theorem to scale out and achieve truly autonomous systems with strictly ordered eventual consistency. We'll see how technologies like Apache Kafka, Apache Camel and Debezium.io can help build the backbone for these types of systems. We'll even explore the details of a working example that brings all of this together. Here's the inspiration for this talk: http://blog.christianposta.com/microservices/the-hardest-part-about-microservices-data/\n\nChristian Posta is a Principal Middleware Specialist/Architect at Red Hat and well known for being an author (Microservices for Java Developers, Oâ€™Reilly 2016), frequent blogger, speaker, open-source enthusiast and committer on Apache ActiveMQ, Apache Camel, Fabric8 and others. Christian has spent time at web-scale companies and now helps companies creating and deploying large-scale distributed architectures - many of what are now called Microservices based. He enjoys mentoring, training and leading teams to be successful with distributed systems concepts, microservices, devops, and cloud-native application design."
