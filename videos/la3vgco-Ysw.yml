description: "There’s definitely a trend to have multiple Kubernetes clusters running within each organization or even within each team. There are situations where this is the only viable approach, but in other circumstances, it could be fine to instead share a bigger Kubernetes cluster with multiple tenants.\n\nThis talk will illustrate the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches and which solutions can be leveraged to alleviate some of their shortcomings. Ultimately there’s no right or wrong decision, it’s all a matter of understanding the trade-offs of both approaches. The goal of this talk is to help you evaluate which path to follow based on your requirements.\n\nPresenter:\n\nFlavio Castelli, Distinguished Engineer @SUSE"
