description: "Multithreaded Java applications commonly exchange information and coordinate operations by using the Java collections framework. Using these classes efficiently to achieve maximum scalability and performance requires an understanding of the fundamentals of Java performance. This session reveals the fundamentals of threading, synchronization, atomic operations, locks versus CAS, contention, false sharing, deadlocks, fairness, and other topics while looking at their impact on collections performance.\n\n\nAuthors:\nChris Hegarty\nundefined\nView more trainings by Chris Hegarty at https://www.parleys.com/author/chris-hegarty\n\nMichael Duigou\nMike Duigou is a developer on the Oracle Java Core Libraries team.
