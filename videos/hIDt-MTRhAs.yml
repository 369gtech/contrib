recordingDate: 1542039712
description: "Good design and ideas rarely happen in isolation. They are shaped by complex invisible forces that people from the outside can't observe. The bigger the organization and the team, the harder it is to get your ideas to happen.\n\nIn this talk, Adrian discusses the importance of designing for attention. This is not a talk about deception and luring people into using products they don't need. It's about framing ideas in a way that gets them noticed both in- and outside of the workplace. - Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/amuse\n\nSave the date!
