description: "Keynote: What Does the .NET Renaissance Mean to Cloud Foundry – Matthew Horan, Software Engineer & Shanfan Huang, Product Designer, Pivotal\n\nIn the past few years, Microsoft has made several big moves to embrace open source, and to join the DevOps movement with Cloud Foundry and other players. At the same time, while many organizations are excited about the transformational future, they worry about their legacy workloads that have been running for decades. These organizations don’t want to be left behind, yet struggle to find a path forward.\nWe want to meet these organizations half way. The .NET Windows team has been working out some new and exciting solutions to handle legacy Windows workloads, taking us one step closer to bringing cloud-native practices to .NET developers. With the .NET Renaissance having started a couple years ago, we see a huge opportunity for the CF OSS community to make a difference. Come to this keynote and learn how you can be part of the force!\n\nhttps://cfseu18.sched.com/event/FW1Z/keynote-what-does-the-net-renaissance-mean-to-cloud-foundry-matthew-horan-software-engineer-shanfan-huang-product-designer-pivotal"
