description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\netcd Watchers Not Working? Improving Error Handling in Your Applications - Guillermo Nunez, IBM \n\nWhen building services with etcd, one of the best features of etcd is watchers. It allows developers to create applications such that when a dataset is changed, the watcher for that dataset on another system receives the notification and performs user-specified action. A simple use case is a user has a program using etcd watchers to monitor the stock market and sell (user-defined action) if their stock of interest falls below price $X.    There are error failures that are not automatically covered with an etcd cluster such as network connectivity issues, DC outage, and cloud infrastructure maintenance. The talk consists of the following:  - what watchers are  - how to build your services using heartbeat key for monitoring etcd watchers  - perform locking on watchers to prevent race conditions  - caching data locally for your service to keep running until the etcd cluster is back up.\n\nhttps://sched.co/ZetF"
