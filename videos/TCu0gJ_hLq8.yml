description: "Thanks to our Community Sponsors: Honeycomb.io and CircleCI.com\n\nSpeaker: Meri Williams (Experienced CTO)\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has probably made many of us view our Business Continuity Management approach quite differently to how we might have 6 months ago. Have you ever groaned when asked to fill in a risk assessment before? Or dismissed being unable to access the office for weeks at a time as \"so vanishingly improbable as to not be worth planning for?\"\n\nIn this talk, experienced CTO Meri Williams will discuss the few key strategies, tools and approaches to have a Business Continuity Management approach that is both pragmatic and useful, with real-life examples of how using these have protected organisations where she has worked, including Procter & Gamble, the Government Digital Service and Monzo bank."
