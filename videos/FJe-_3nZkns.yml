description: "This session delves into 3D animation in JavaFX, including the process by which Duke was brought to life in the 3D animated chess demo at JavaOne 2013. Concepts covered are modeling 3D geometry, building a transform hierarchy for 3D animation, tangent interpolators, 3D geometry skinning to transforms, and subdivision surfaces.\n\n\nAuthor:\nJohn Yoon\nJohn is an interaction and visual designer in the Java organization. He worked on the 3D modeling and animation for the JavaFX 3D keynote demos at JavaOne 2011 (Duke 3D Kinect), 2012 (JavaFX 3D Container Terminal Monitoring), 2013 (Duke 3D Animated Chess). John studied animation at the UCLA Film School, where he received his Master of Fine Arts in Animation. Prior to working at Oracle, John worked in the animation industry as a Character Technical Director at Disney Animation and DreamWorks Animation.\nView more trainings by John Yoon at https://www.parleys.com/author/john-yoon-1\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
