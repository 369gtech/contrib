description: "How to Manage State in Thick Client Apps\nAs server side developers build stateless server side applications and start to develop JavaScript applications and frameworks, there are new challenges they face surrounding 'state'. Users now have long-lived sessions interacting with the same client side runtime, instead of only creating context for the duration of one request on the server. This makes memory leaks, presentation state, and state teardown quite important all of a sudden, and often server side developers (like me) can be caught unaware. The aforementioned problems have been dealt with in the past in other stateful UI frameworks like Cocoa, but lots of JS developers have never been exposed to such things. This talk will show how easy it is to get bitten by long-lived session problems using some real world examples from Shopify and Batman.js, and also suggest some strategies for mitigation."
