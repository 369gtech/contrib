Planning, setting expectations and work or project assessments are but a portion of a manager's obligation. With the advent of new generations entering the market place managers are now required to be experts in leadership, delegation, focus and alignment.\n\nEveryone uses perspectives, from dawn to dusk and even in dreams. From the time we awake ideas and thoughts are packaged into perspectives.\n\nPerspectives help us with decisions and ultimately guides us in navigating the sea of life. However, we are not alone in this world and for every one person there is a multitude of perspectives.\n\nSo who holds the truth for any given situation? Which perspective is the ‘right’ one? This is our belief - the path to truth is the sum all offered perspectives for any given context or situation. Our beliefs and values are what define our limitations in the number of perspectives we can take. Hence it is very difficult for one to hold the whole truth about anything because of these limitations.\n\nGoing beyond our limitations is one of the answers towards becoming more creative, innovative and inviting discovery.\n\nIf your intention is to adapt and become a great Agile manager, coach or leader; then join us in this interactive presentation.\n\nCome and take part in a session that will stretch and challenge your ability to take different perspectives. It will invite you to have a wider view of what is actually going on and have more insights for more meaningful decisions.\n\nEvent Page: http://2016.agilesingapore.org\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/XvTK/"
