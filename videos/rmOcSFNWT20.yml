title: 'YOW! Lambda Jam 2019 - Christopher Biggs - Rapid Web productivity in Elm - Single Page Apps and more'
recordingDate: 1563310806
description: "Elm is a functional language for the web that compiles to Javascript. As you would expect with any zero-dot version, the language is still settling done, and with\n\nalmost a year since the previous release there are a lot of changes, and many breaking ones. But one of the clear benefits of functional programming is ease of refactoring, so\n\nElm19 promises that most of the changes can be automatically applied to your program.\n\nThe notable new features in Elm19 are\n\nsupport for single-page apps and other explicit web content patterns\neven better (!) friendly compiler messages that guide rather than chide\nfaster compilation, and smaller object sizes\nremoval of some features like custom infix operators that are deemed more harmful than helpful\nThis talk will concentrate on how to be immediately productive with single-page apps in Elm, and digress briefly in how to migrate to Elm19 if you have not yet done so.\n\nChristopher Biggs has been into Open Systems since the early 90s and was there at the birth of Linux and 386BSD. His interest in electronics and connected devices goes back even further. He has worked as a developer, System Architect and Engineering Manager.\n\nChristopher is now the principal of Accelerando Consulting, a boutique consultancy specialising in Internet of Things (IoT), DevOps mentorship and Cloud Data. Accelerando helps businesses get the most from their technology and tools, and creates custom solutions to meet clientsâ€™ unique needs.
