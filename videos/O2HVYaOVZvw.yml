description: "Chandra Guntur\nDirector\nBNY Mellon\n\nThere now exist several vendors for Java. This session will provide meaningful data-points that can be weighted within your organization to help make the right decisions, but will NOT attempt to influence which vendor is chosen. This session highlights various decision factors that go into making the right choices, be it key differentiators, usage, licensing models, support, patching etc. that determine what works best for your organization. Additionally, decisions such as sticking to an exixting version of Java (say Java 8 or moving to a new stable version such as Java 11, or moving along side the each version of Java will be evaluated). Data from the some of the well-known Java vendors will be shared as examples used in evaluation."
