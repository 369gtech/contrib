description: "\"Azure Durable Functions represented the last missing building block to code long running, stateful function orchestrations in a serverless environment. \nThe Orchestrator function allow you to do several new things that differentiates it from an ordinary, stateless function.\nFor example you can call and await other functions, save outputs, and then resume the local state that is never lost.\nDurable Functions 2.0 are even more powerful with many aspects borrowed from the Actor Model but also some important differences.\nJoin me and start playing with Durable Functions!\""
