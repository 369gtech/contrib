title: 'Indie.vc: Rewriting the rules of Silicon Valley—A conversation with OATV partner Bryce Roberts'
language: English
recordingDate: 1477922082
description: 'In Silicon Valley, the expectation is go big or go home. Every company is shooting to raise capital, grow fast, “blitzscale,” and sell out. (OK, a few are shooting to stay in the game for the long haul, but far too few.) Bryce Roberts, my partner at O’Reilly AlphaTech Ventures, noticed another class of company that was being ignored: a company that may need a little money to get going but wants to build a business the old-fashioned way—for the long haul, profitable, cash-flow positive, and self-funded. We’ll talk with Bryce about why Silicon Valley venture capital needs a reboot and why Indie.vc-style startups may be more important to the economy than traditional Silicon Valley startups. As Candace Mitchell, founder of Indie.vc-funded startup Myavana puts it: “Before Indie.vc, I was focused on raising a million dollars. Now I’m focused on generating a million dollars in revenue.”'
