description: "Elixir Tooling\nhttp://www.erlang-factory.com/berlin2014/eric-meadowsjonsson\nYou may have been introduced to Elixir before. The language features have been shown; strong meta-programming, protocols, and Erlang interop. This talk is about the less talked about, but equally important, surrounding features of Elixir.\n\nEric will talk about Elixir tooling specifically Mix the build tool and Hex the package manager. The talk will go in-depth about Mix's project and build structure, how dependencies are handled, how to create custom Mix tasks and what Hex brings to the table. Eric will also show how the standard library and tooling can be used by Erlang developers. \n\nTalk objectives:\n\nIntroduce the audience to Elixir tooling, including Mix and Hex\n\nTarget audience:\n\nBeginner Elixir developers and Erlang developers interested in Elixir"
