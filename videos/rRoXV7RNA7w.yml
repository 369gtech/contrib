description: "Continuous Delivery to Cloud Foundry: Why Your Junior Devs Will Love It! - Robert Summers, Armakuni\n\nHow can you take junior developers, hand them the keys to the kingdom, and trust them to deliver features to production for your clients without micromanaging every line of code they push? The answer is easy if you are using tools like Concourse and Cloud Foundry. \n\nConcourse is a tool that allows for automated continuous delivery which also happens to work extremely well with deploying apps to Cloud Foundry. \n\nSpeaker Robert Summers recently underwent this journey. He abandoned his career to become a developer through Europe’s leading Web Developer bootcamp and joined Armakuni, a consultancy specialising in cloud-native solutions.\n\nRobert will share some of the challenges that come with entering such a technical field and provide tips for shepherding novices like them into the world of Continuous Delivery and Cloud Foundry.\n\nAbout Robert Summers\nRobert Summers worked in the insurance industry for over twelve years before changing careers to application development. This has made him fully versed in how things work on the ‘other-side’ of development. Robert works for Armakuni, delivering cloud based solutions for clients, as well as training developers how to use Cloud Foundry."
