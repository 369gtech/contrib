description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nRunning data-heavy applications such as SQL, NoSQL and BigData is a challenging task. What is even more challenging is the lifecycle management of these applications. One of the important life-cycle operations is taking consistent snapshots of data-heavy applications for data protection and backing up these application snapshots up to a different media, eg. Cloud. What does it really take to snapshot an entire application? In this webinar, Ravikumar Alluboyina will introduce the concept of Volume Consistency Groups. We will take a look at why a Volume Consistency Group is a must-have for retaining data consistency."
