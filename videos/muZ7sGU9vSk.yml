description: "How to (In)Effectively Convey Privacy Choices with Icons and Link Text\n\nLorrie Faith Cranor, Carnegie Mellon University; Florian Schaub, University of Michigan\n\nClear communication about privacy through icons and/or just a few words can be a difficult challenge. We have been involved in a number of research projects that evaluated proposed and implemented privacy choice icons and short text, including most recently studies related to the CCPA opt-out button. In this talk we will discuss our research into privacy icons and text, explaining both our methods, and our findings. We will demonstrate how to conduct these sorts of studies quickly and at low cost, and discuss why they are so important. We will also provide lessons learned about what works and what doesnâ€™t when you want to communicate about privacy through icons and short text.\n\nView the full PEPR '20 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/pepr20/conference-program"
