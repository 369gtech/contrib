title: 'GopherCon 2020: Travis Smith - Optimizing Performance using a VM and Go Plugins'
language: English
recordingDate: 1608669594
description: "Running code at a massive scale can often be challenging. Although Go makes this easier than ever, wouldn't it be nice to have a few tricks to get to the next level?\n\nTravis will take you on a deep dive of how a formula evaluation system works and the particular challenges faced when trying to optimize for speed and scale. Using Excel as an example, you will discover how to parse and evaluate formulas, and then explore two alternative solutions to create huge performance improvements with simple, straightforward designs.\n\nSpecifically, you will learn how to:\n\n  •  Design an Intermediate Language and build a simple Virtual Machine\n  •  Generate Go code that is compiled and loaded at run-time using the Go Plugin system\n\nHave no fear! Although virtual machines and compilers sound daunting, you'll see that they can be completely approachable and actually reduce storage and complexity concerns while boosting performance to unimaginable heights."
