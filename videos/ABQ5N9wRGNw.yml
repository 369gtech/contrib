description: "Even the best engineers are limited by some human factors in their development process: most notably by incorrect estimation time and scope, or the wrong interpretation of the end goal of a product from a client’s description. Rapid Prototyping is a simple tool that can drastically reduce human factors errors in initial product design, both internally to a team or directly with a client. The aims of this workshop are to give discrete toolsets to measure 1) maximum learning per min effort in your team, and 2) how to make your initial product real enough for the client to feel. For developers, learning this process, it not only allows for clearer communication but maximum creativity, as the fail-fast system allows you to explore several routes to creating an ideal product with low risk. Clojure is an ideal language to build in this way.\n\nWe will cover two methods that are essential for software engineering:\nPrototyping for Software/Interactive Scope – how to test and de-risk digital experiences in short time scales \nPrototyping or Client Interaction – how to test key meetings, negotiations, and investor interactions."
