description: "In Java world, Spring is a great beast, a Dragon, and with a reason. Spring is very powerful framework with does a lot of developers and give them a lot of power. All this power of course doesn't come without it's price.\n\nMost of the developers using Spring, are either happy to pay this price or not aware of it at all. On other hand Micronaut comes with the promise of all the power of Spring, however without any of it's costs.\n\nLet us look at it, how it compare and differ to Spring and if it lives up to its promises."
