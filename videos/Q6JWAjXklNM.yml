description: "This video was recorded at Code Mesh V 2020 - https://codesync.global/conferences/code-mesh-ldn/\n\nBuilding a better web with WebAssembly at the edge |  Aaron Turner - Softare Engineer at at Fastly\n\nABSTRACT\nWebAssembly is an exciting new technology, which opens a lot of doors for how applications are built on the web, and lays the foundation for what edge computing will become: a more performant and flexible place to deliver those websites and applications. The WebAssembly ecosystem is young one, but Senior Software Engineer at Fastly, Aaron Turner, has seen firsthand how the community is quickly growing and developing key technologies that unlock Wasm's potential to transform edge computing and beyond.\n\nIn this session Aaron will highlight some of the key features that make WebAssembly a great fit for applications running on the edge, and share some of the incredible work -- both open source and Fastly-supported projects -- that the community has done to enable this.\n\nOBJECTIVES\nExplore WebAssembly as an exciting opportunity to run code on the edge, outside of the browser. And how this enables languages to run on new, untraditional platforms per their ecosystem..\n\n• Follow us on social: \n  Website: https://codesync.global/conferences/code-mesh-ldn/\n  Twitter: https://twitter.com/CodeMeshIO\n\n• Looking for a unique learning experience?\n  Attend the next Code Sync conference near you! \n  See what's coming up at: https://codesync.global \n\n• SUBSCRIBE TO OUR CHANNEL\n  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC47eUBNO8KBH_V8AfowOWOw"
