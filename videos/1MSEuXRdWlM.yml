description: '#Codemotion Rome 2018 - Would you like to provision a complete, fully configured DevOps environment with a single request? Or to get your application deployed automatically, in any cloud, everytime you commit a source edit? A powerful demo of how quick you can get it with CloudCenter: a single click to get a new source code repository (e.g. SVN, GitLab), a Jenkins orchestrator, an artifact repository (e.g. JFrog Artifactory or a web server) deployed and integrated end to end. After it’s done, we’ll see how the CI/CD process uses CloudCenter itself to deploy a web application on any cloud.'
