As a demonstration, Uderzo, an OpenGL based graphics system targeted towards simple UIs for Nerves-style systems, will be explained.\n\nRead the full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/cees-de-groot/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - CEES DE GROOT\nTurned a Sillicon Valley unicorn into an Elixir company\n\nCees de Groot is a coder at heart with 30 years of experience in the field. A long journey through the lands of many programming languages made him land at his current resting spot of Elixir country, where he spends most of his time either at work or in the evening toying with Nerves. Born and raised in the Netherlands, he now lives in rural Canada working remotely.\n\nMore on Cees de Groot: https://codesync.global/speaker/cees-de-groot/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM SF 19\nCode BEAM SF is powered by Code Sync.
