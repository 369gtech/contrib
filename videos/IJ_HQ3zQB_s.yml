title: 'Test-Driven Development with Java EE 7, Arquillian, and CDI Containers'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433784705
description: "This technical session introduces Java developers, designers, and architects to the Arquillian framework, Gradle, and the enterprise container technologies in Java EE 7. As a lucrative bonus, it covers building EJB and Java EE 7 test applications with Gradle, the latest and greatest build framework for the Java platform, which improves on Apache Maven. The Java EE specification contains two and half different containers, namely the Web, EJB, and the CDI containers. All of them can be reached with the Arquillian framework, and this means that there is now one general testing framework. The session covers writing meaningful tests for CDI, EJB, HTML5 WebSocket, and JAX-RS 2.0 in the real world.\n\n\nAuthor:\nPeter Pilgrim\nundefined\nView more trainings by Peter Pilgrim at https://www.parleys.com/author/peter-pilgrim\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
