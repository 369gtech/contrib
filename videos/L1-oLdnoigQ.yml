description: "What do you do when you outscale your monitoring systems, and need to upgrade -- while keeping the lights on 24/7 around the world? This talk will walk through the ins and outs of architecting a real-time data processing architecture from the ground up in order to handle critical, high-traffic monitoring load across a distributed backend, along with several war stories of where it went well, failed horribly, and saved our bacon.\n\nPrepare for a magical mystery tour of distributed delights, diving into real-time pipeline architectures and building Go-based microservices. We'll cover how interoperability contracts, dynamic configuration and service discovery allow you to develop and operate at speed, plus how this all fits on top of a rock-solid foundation of Kafka with ElasticSearch. You'll leave armed with a toolbox of ideas to build and monitor your own microservice-based ecosystem."
