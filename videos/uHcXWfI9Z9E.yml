description: 'DevOps at Scale as a problem to solve is becoming more relevant every day. Although there isn’t that much of information how to do it on real multi-project. When I try to address it, techy geeks get into techy rumble and forget what was the question about. This talk abstracts from technology and focuses purely on cultural and organizational topics in a fun way. ''So… meet delivery lead John. He got a brilliant idea - how basically from nothing to make the cutest bunny in the world.'''
