title: 'Oracle Data Safe Assessment: New features, new user interface'
language: English
recordingDate: 1634315925
description: "One of our biggest projects over this year is the migration of Oracle Data Safe to an Oracle Cloud-Native application. This ongoing effort moves the Data Safe console from a stand-alone entity into the wider OCI framework, open dozens of new APIs for customization and integration. The move significantly improves the ability of Data Safe to work with other OCI-native services, including the notification service. We've recently completed phase two of that journey with the move of security and user assessment from the legacy Data Safe console into the new OCI framework. In this month's office hours, we review the new user interface and demonstrate some of the enhanced functionality including the long-awaited ability to send email notifications!\n\nHere is a guide to the recording;\n\n00:19 Announcements\n05:40 Data Safe assessment\n09:45 Changes to security assessment (fleet view)\n10:35 Changes to user assessment (fleet view, baseline/drift detection, object privileges)\n11:45 Demonstration\n18:49 Configuring email notifications"
