After all, if the battery is dead, no one can use your application. In this session, Android engineer Jeffrey Sharkey will reveal the myriad ways -- many unexpected -- that your application can guzzle power and irritate users. You'll learn about how networking affects battery life, the right and wrong ways to use Android-specific features such as wake locks, why you can't assume that it's okay to trade memory for time, and more.\r\n\r\nFor presentation slides and all I/O sessions, please go to: code.google.com/events/io/sessions.html"
