description: "Knative: Scaling From 0 to Infinity - Joseph Burnett & Mark Chmarny, Google \n\nKnative Serving builds on Kubernetes and Istio to provide request driven compute that can scale to 0. It supports a variety of pluggable scaling strategies and tools for managing concurrency and trade-offs between cost and latency. This presentation reviews the challenges of designing and building a system that can rapidly scale serverless workloads to 1000's of pods. And scaling to and from 0 when idle. It presents the scaling capabilities and extension points of Knative Serving and how to configure it to take advantage of both horizontal and vertical scaling. And the concurrency controls to configure Knative Serving as a single-threaded function framework or a multi-threaded application framework (or something in-between). \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/Gra9"
