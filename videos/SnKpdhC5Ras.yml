description: "HTML5 adds support for video by introducing a dedicated element, the video tag, as well as various methods to manipulate playback. As such, it makes video a first-class citizen of the Web, completely integrated within HTML and its adjacent technologies, such as CSS or SVG, while enabling proper accessibility capabilities.\n\nThis initial support is now being extended to accommodate more use cases, such as live streaming or video conferencing. Starting with the basics, W3C's Philippe Le HÃ©garet will look at ongoing work with HTML5 video, including real time, captioning and protected content.\n\nHead to http://mrkn.co/ci43u for all the videos from HTML5DevConf!"
