description: "Jen Zajac\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/239/\n\nAn exploration of the effects on the open source community of Linus Torvald's 2018 apology about his behaviour within the Linux kernel community. Examining his apology and the reaction to it in detail, with a look at the Code of Conduct changes that resulted and why all of this matters even if you're not a kernel dev.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/\n\n#linux.conf.au #linux #foss #opensource"
