description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM V 2020 - https://codesync.global/conferences/code-beam-sto/\n\nMore great virtual tech conferences - https://codesync.global \n\n---\n\nSoftware for one. Ideas for all\nby Chris Keathley |\n\nABSTRACT\nIn the BEAM world, we typically focus on the ways to make our system's fault tolerant, faster, or generally more reliable. This is great when you're building software for work or for a company. But there's an entirely separate class of projects out there. The kind of projects with no tests, no business plan, and only one user; yourself. Unfortunately, we typically don't share these sorts of projects, even though they often include some of our best ideas.\n\nIn this talk, we'll take a closer look at these small projects, and we'll see the profound effect they have on the way that we think about programming.\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - Chris Keathley\nChris is a software engineer building services and applications for Bleacher Report. Although he started out writing C for embedded systems, these days he spends his time in Elixir, Haskell, Go, and Rust. When not writing code for work, Chris can be found writing code for fun, talking about the joys of functional programming, playing pinball, roasting coffee, or building Lego with his kids.\n\n---\n\nCode BEAM V 2020 was sponsored by Duffel, PepsiCo, Klarna, WhatsApp, DNSimple, Flyiin, Erlang Solutions, Forza Football, BlockFi, App Unite, Pleroma, Simplabs, Telnyx, Clever Bunny, O'Reilly, Manning Publications\n\nCode BEAM V\nWebsite: https://codesync.global/conferences/code-beam-sto/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/CodeBEAMio"
