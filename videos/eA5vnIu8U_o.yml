recordingDate: 1545060525
description: "Measuring your data grid's performance it's not a trivial task. In this presentation, Mircea Markus will introduce project Radargun: a benchmarking framework that helps measuring the performance and throughput of in-memory data grids. Radargun offers an simple and effective way to compare how various data grid products would behave based on a specific use case helping you to chose the one that fits your need. It also makes it a great tool setting up a prototyping your data-grid based application in a matter of minutes.\n\nMore Info: https://2012.berlinbuzzwords.de/sessions/measuring-performance-and-capacity-planning-java-based-data-grids\n\nDescription of Mircea Markus:\nhttps://2012.berlinbuzzwords.de/content/mircea-markus"
