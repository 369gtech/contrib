description: "DevOpsDays Boston 2018 - Everything Is A Product - How To Apply Product Management Practices to Technology Services by Matt Stratton\n\nAs we continue to work on improving our technology processes, there is much we can learn from the discipline of product management. I believe that by applying the techniques and approach of treating your infrastructure and service offerings as products, we can provide a more delightful experience and continuously improve.\n\nUsing principles and concepts from people like Marty Kagan and other experts in the product space, I will demonstrate applicable examples of applying the concepts of feedback, planning, and iterative improvement to practices including software delivery process, service desk response, and infrastructure as code."
