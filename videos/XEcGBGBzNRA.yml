description: "The Smallest Possible SRE Team\n\nZach Thomas, Genesys\n\nYou want to make the most of your SRE initiatives, but you don't have Google's scale. You can run an effective SRE program with only one person, but you need leverage. We will show you how to amplify your reach when you can't be everywhere at once. You will learn how to use data, tools, and communication to have an outsized impact on your organization.\n\nView the full SREcon20 Americas program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon20americas/program"
