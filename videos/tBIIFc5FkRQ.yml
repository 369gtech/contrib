description: "When it comes to accessibility support, it can be difficult for teams to know what to focus on and how to get started. Sometimes it can be hard to justify the effort when teams think it only benefits a \"few\" users, which is a debatable assumption. Whether you're new to the subject or you're keen on knowing more about it, this talk is for you.\n\nIn this talk, you will learn how supporting accessibility helps in a lot of different cases, from temporal illnesses or reversible situations to severe disabilities. Moreover, you will learn how people use different Android accessibility services such as Talkback or SwitchAccess to interact with your application in a different way. We will also explore the current range of developer tools that can be used to spot potential accessibility issues in our apps. \n\nAnd finally, you will learn how developers, designers and product managers can work together to make sure that we create experiences for everyone.\n\nhttps://it.droidcon.com/2019/it\nhttps://twitter.com/droidconit\nhttps://www.facebook.com/droidconIt"
