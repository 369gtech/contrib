description: "This video was recorded at Scala Days Copenhagen 2017\nFollow us on Twitter @ScalaDays or visit our website for more information http://scaladays.org \n\nAbstract: \nIn this talk, we will have an interactive live coding session where we will use Scala Meta to code something useful (a code generator for your REST API). Hopefully this will embolden other Scala users to explore macros for profit and fun without fear."
