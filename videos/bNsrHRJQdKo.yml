description: "We're going to build our own version of Conway's famous Game of Life in 60 lines of Python! The Game of Life simulates biological evolution and is an example of how mind-boggling complexity can emerge from just a few simple rules. This video isn't straight up machine learning, but instead an intro into this way of thinking. If the universe works this way, our brains must as well. I truly believe that the master algorithm behind human intelligence will be much simpler than we expect. \n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/simulation_demo\n\nI created a Slack channel for us, sign up here:\nhttps://wizards.herokuapp.com/\n\nI recently created a Patreon page. If you like my videos, feel free to help support my effort here!:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/user?ty=h&u=3191693\n\nOnline Implementation of the Game of Life here:\nhttp://www.bitstorm.org/gameoflife/\n\nCommunity dedicated to the Game of Life:\nhttp://conwaylife.com/\n\nAwesome article on the Game of Life:\nhttp://www.math.cornell.edu/~lipa/mec/lesson6.html\n\nVariations of the Game of Life:\nhttps://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/2008-09/modeling-natural-systems/gameOfLife2.html\n\nReally, really good read-up on Cellular Automata:\nhttp://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-7-cellular-automata/\n\nMuch more to come so please subscribe, like, and comment.\nFollow me:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/sirajraval\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/sirajology Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/sirajraval/ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/sirajraval/"
