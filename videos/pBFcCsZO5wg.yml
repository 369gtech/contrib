description: 'How can technology support agile decision making in organisations? How do we measure the impact of our programmes on the wider business and market? What types of software architecture will be needed in the future to allow for dynamic continuous change? How can we shift from responded to needs, to anticipating needs that have not yet been articulated? Complexity theory gives us a radical new way of addressing these and other aspects of systems with high levels of uncertainty. This presentation will provide some of the theory and the practice to allow new ways of working, and as importantly thinking.'
