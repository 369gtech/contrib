description: "From OSCON 2014: Ryan Vinyard's keynote talk, \"Open manufacturing: Bringing Open Hardware Beyond 3D Printing.\" Open source design has been a recent trend in hardware, but it tends to be limited to open libraries of 3D-printable parts. These are geared at makers, artists, hobbyists, and whoever else really wants to print their own figurines, not necessarily the engineering community.\n\nSo far there has not been much traction from companies large or small in releasing specifics on manufacturing openly, so this talk addresses the benefits and tradeoffs of making your entire hardware design and manufacturing process open source from concept sketch all the way to tooling for injection molding.\n\nAbout Ryan Vinyard (Highway1):\nRyan is the Engineering Lead at Highway1, a hardware-focused startup accelerator located in San Francisco under parent company PCH International. He is a Mechanical Engineer who came to PCH through its consulting arm Lime Lab, where he developed consumer products for Fortune 500 brands. Previous to PCH, Ryan worked at startups in the cleantech and electric vehicle space where he developed novel powertrain, motor control, and thermal systems. Ryan holds a B.S. in Product Design from Stanford University.\n\nWatch more from OSCON, O'Reilly's open source convention: http://goo.gl/HlGwvP\nFind out more about the convention: http://oscon.com\n\nDon't miss an upload!
