If you donâ€™t like stickers, Iâ€™m sorry, just return next week and there while be programming content again. \n \nAs of today, you can become a Super Patron of Fun Fun Function for $9 a month. If you become a Super Patron before October ends, I will mail you the Fun Fun Function Autumn 2018 sticker pack. This is your only chance to get this particular sticker pack, weâ€™ll never print it again.\n\nIf that is all you need to know, there is a link in the episode description to become a Super Patron, there is no need to watch the rest of the video,  because itâ€™s just going to be me trying to convince you to become a Super Patron. Iâ€™m going to talk a little about Patreon and Iâ€™m going to show off the stickeeeeers and Iâ€™m going to tell you a little story about each of the stickers.\n\nWhat is a Super Patron?\n\nWell, you, hopefully. \n\nAs you might know, the production of Fun Fun Function is mostly funded by Patrons. As a Patron of Fun Fun Function, you chip in a few bucks at the end of each month to support the production of Fun Fun Function, and you are basically the reason why I've been able to continue producing this show for the last 3.5 years. \n\nUp until today, there used to be many different level of Patrons, but as of today weâ€™re simplifying into just two levels - Forum Patron and Super Patron.   As a Forum Patron, you chip in $2 per month. As thanks, you get access to the Fun Fun Forum, which Iâ€™m very proud of - over the years, Fun Fun Forum has really turned out exactly into what I wanted it to be - a place where I can have friendly, familiar, fun discussions with all of you. As a Super Patron, you chip in $9 per month. To be honest, being a Super Patron is almost exactly like being a Forum Patron - itâ€™s just more expensive - you should only become a Super Patron if personally feel like you want to give the production of the show some extra support, BUT on some months all super Super Patrons will get random loot, and in October, that random loot is the sticker pack.\n\nSo, if you become a Super Patron before October ends, I will mail you the Fun Fun Function Autumn 2018 sticker pack. This is your only chance to get this particular sticker pack, weâ€™ll never print it again.\n\nIf you are a Patron already, but not a Super Patron, you need to switch to  Super Patron in order to get the sticker pack, and you need to be a Super Patron at the end of October, thatâ€™s when the Patreon billing cycle happens. \n\nThere is of course no obligation to stay a Super Patron after the end of October - if you want to stay a Super Patron after sticker drive and give the show some extra support , thatâ€™s great, Iâ€™m super grateful, but if you drop down down to Forum Patron or stop being a Patron altogether thatâ€™s fine too, I still lÃ¶Ã¶Ã¶ve you."
