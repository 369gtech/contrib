Extended leaves are an amazing benefit and highly valuable to the individual and their company. Preparing for leave comes with its own set of risks and challenges, but many people neglect to prepare for the challenges that arise on returning from leave.\n\nYou will learn how to deal with the concerns you may experience as you re-integrate into your workplace, including:\n- Am I still good at my job?\n- If my team succeeded while I was away, do they still need me?\n- Everything is the same!\n- Everything is different!\n- I gave away my Legos, now what?\n\nLeaders will learn how to help their reports return to work effectively and positively. Teammates will learn how to support and empathize with their teammate returning to work. Those who’ve taken such a leave will nod along, knowing that they are not alone. This talk will provide actionable insights into what it’s like to return to work after an extended leave, the challenges one may face, and how to overcome them.\n\nAbout Matt Newkirk\nMatt gets a lot of pleasure from helping people work through their challenges. He currently does that as a senior manager responsible for Localization & Translation at Etsy, on his path of learning to manage managers. Prior to Etsy, Matt worked as an infrastructure and test engineer and as a QA Manager where he caught the leadership bug. He occasionally writes about what he’s learned on his website mattnewkirk.com when he isn’t exhausted from parenting his two awesome children. Matt recently returned from six months of parental leave and is always game to share his journey with you."
