description: "Design Your Own YouTube Player\r\nGeoff Stearns (Google)\r\n\r\nThe YouTube player APIs allow you to take nearly full control over the YouTube embedded video players. Controls like play, pause, seeking, volume controls, and event updates are all possible and easy to set up. The new Chromeless player allows you to build your own controls and interactions that play YouTube videos. In this session we will look at how to use both the YouTube player APIs and the Chromeless player in your apps and on your site.\r\n\r\nPre-reqs: Basic Javascript, or basic Actionscript 2.0 knowledge"
