description: "After making the smallest possible transistors, Moore’s law is coming to an end. Researchers and technologists are pursuing new quantum computers. In this talk I’ll do an intro to what makes these computers special, the code that runs on them, and how we could start securing our systems and servers with post-quantum encryption.\n\njsQuil is a library which allows you to create assembly-like instructions for quantum computers and virtual machines, by writing code in a high-level language (JavaScript/NodeJS).\n\nCodeCrypt is a drop-in replacement for GPG which helps you encrypt messages, documents, and emails in ways which confound quantum computer codebreakers. Last year Google, the NSA, and NIST started recommending adopting new encryption tools to prepare for quantum computing, including lattice-based encryption and BoringSSL to keep the web secure.\n\nEVENT:\n\nØredev 2017\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nNicholas Doiron\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nØredev  Conference Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to publish this video."
