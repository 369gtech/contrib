description: "Yo my coding ninja fledglings, in this HTML lesson for beginners we'll dive into adding some JavaScript into our HTML web page. JavaScript controls the interactivity of our web pages and can be added in a variety of ways to HTML.\n\nWe add JavaScript to HTML by using the script tag in the head of body, by referencing an external script file, or by adding some in-line scripting onto tags themselves.\n\nFor more front-end development courses & to black-belt your coding skills, head over to https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg or http://thenetninja.co.uk\n\nComment with any questions and don't forget to subscribe!"
