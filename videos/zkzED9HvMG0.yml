description: "Amazon Web Service (AWS) offers developers a lot of services, from compute to data storage to serverless functions. In this video, we'll use AWS to train an AI to predict whether or not a customer will churn from using our service. Along the way, I'll explain how different components of the compute service like EC2, Elastic Beanstalk, LightSail, and the EC2 container service work. We'll also look at how SageMaker makes the whole pipeline much faster for beginners. The XGBoost technique will give us some favorable results, and I'll explain why at the end. Amazon did not pay me to make this video. Enjoy!\n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/Amazon_Training_Video\n\nPlease Subscribe! And like. And comment.
