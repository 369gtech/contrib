title: 'Manifesto for a DevOps-like Culture Shift in Data & Analytics - Sean Gustafson, Arif Wider'
recordingDate: 1533111131
description: "More and more companies migrate their monolithic applications to a microservices architecture. However, maintaining a consistent and usable data landscape has only become more challenging by this: huge amounts of structured and unstructured data, and hundreds of data sources.\nFurthermore, data-driven product development multiplies the analytics requirements: every product team needs constantly updated and specially tailored metrics which often combine product specific data with company wide data. \nHaving a centralized data team does not scale in this setting as it becomes the bottleneck between data producers and data consumers.\nWe created a Manifesto of seven principles which break with traditional separation of roles and show a path how to deal with distributed data in a federal and scalable fashion. This leads to DataDevOps: a culture shift similar to DevOps in which application developers own their data and take over responsibilities for data & analytics.\nLearn about our experiences and best practices with facilitating this cultural transformation at Scout24, the provider of Europeâ€™s largest online markets for cars and real estate."
