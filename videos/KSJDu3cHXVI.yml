description: "You Build It, You Secure It\n\nJohn Willis, Vice President of DevOps and Digital Practices, SJ Technologies \n\nEarly on in the \"cloud\" Werner Vogals made his famous quote \"You Build It, You Run It\". With Devops we learned that this became a mantra for shared responsibility between developers and operations. Operations learned how to process infrastructure as code and participate early in the supply chain of a service's life cycle. \n\nDevelopers learned that they had responsibilities to enable and in some cases operationalize their service. Now there is a new movement to include and collaborate in a similar way with Security. This is all part of a \"everything\" shift left ideal. Developers and operations are taught the importance of including security in the stories and all parts of the delivery pipeline including security gates as well as code test gates.\n\nDOES17 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
