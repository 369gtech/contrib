description: 'Everyone has a compile step these days, whether it''s CSS preprocessing, bundling, minification, linting, testing, or optimisation, we all want to make our lives easier by automating build and deploy. But to some, the more complex the build gets, the more we get away from the fundamental motivations for many of the web technologies we love to use. Should we fix this in tooling, or by just making build processes even more sophisticated, or with browser developments like HTTP 2.0 which negate the need for some or all of the build step?'
