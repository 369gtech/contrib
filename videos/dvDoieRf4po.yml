title: 'Idiomatic Spock'
recordingDate: 1406468055
description: 'Going beyond the basics of how to use Spock this talk will discuss writing expressive, readable &amp; maintainable specifications using the features of Spock and the Groovy language itself. Concrete examples backed up with live coding will cover a range of topics such as how to structure assertions, effective use of the where: block, appropriate use of mocks and stubs, and driving specifications from a database. The focus will always remain on creating tests that are readable, robust and helpful when you need to deal with regressions.'
