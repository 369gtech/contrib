description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io\_The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nPutting an Invisible Shield on Kubernetes Secrets - Kailun Qin, Ant Group \n\nK8S secrets are widely applied in production to keep sensitive information managed in store. The integration to a KMS even with hardware-based plugins does enhance the protection but is far from enough, especially for financial-grade security requirements. Lacking of an end-to-end secret hardening solution, the attack surface remains largely unprotected from the threats within the other key elements/flows in a K8S cluster. With a convergence of Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) and enhanced authentication, this session explores an answer to guard K8S secrets while in use, at rest, and in transit. Changes are made for kubectl, K8S master and node to guarantee the availability but confidentiality of secrets. The TEE transparency to both developers and users will be elaborated and showcased with a demo. Finally, the practice experience at Alibaba and the KEP to community will be shared. \n\nhttps://sched.co/cp9X"
