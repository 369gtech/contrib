description: "► Check out https://gorails.com for Pro episodes and more!\n► SaaS business template for Ruby on Rails with built-in features like Payments, Teams, and much more: https://jumpstartrails.com\n► Ruby on Rails hosting with Hatchbox.io: https://hatchbox.io\n► Learn how to add Stripe Payments (with SCA support!) with Ruby on Rails: https://courses.gorails.com/payments-with-rails-master-class\n\nA lot of you guys have asked to see how I would build a Ruby on Rails app from start to finish with all the details, so that's what we're doing in this series. \n\nWe'll be building an old app of mine called AnimatedGif.me that I built many years ago just to archive gifs and make them very easily accessible. The old site was very simple and so we're not only going to rebuild it but we're also going to greatly improve it."
