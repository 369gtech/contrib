recordingDate: 1631735322
description: "Project Update: Libs Team by Mara Bos \n\nA story about how things get stuck, and how to get things moving again. Taking improvements to the standard library's locks as an example, we'll take a look at how large efforts often get stuck, and explore what can be done in such situations. We'll look into breaking problems apart, how to narrow the scope of discussions, and finally at some organisational changes that might help a bit."
