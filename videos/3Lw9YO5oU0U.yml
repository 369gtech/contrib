description: "In this screencast I create a Java EE microservice from scratch, adjust the load balancer configuration, create and deploy the load balancer with two microservice instances and test the configuration. Finally one node is killed and started to check the load balancer behavior and monitor the configuration in real time using the monitoring dashboard.\n\nSee you at http:://airhacks.com or http://airhacks.io"
