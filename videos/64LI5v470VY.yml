description: "Sander Hoogendoorn - How thinking small is changing software development big time\n\nChief architect at @QubyEnergy | Freelance CTO, software architect and programmer | Agile coach and trainer\n\nThe world is changing fast. More precisely, the world is changing at increasing speed. This means things that were not possible five years ago come into reach. Incumbent organizations need to adapt fast to keep up with new competitors that use new technologies easier, faster and better than they do. As a result, every aspect of software changes towards smaller. Even smaller teams or even micro-teams, less management, flatter organizations, even shorter cycles, and smaller components.\n\nFrontend Love 19th Feb 2020\n1132 Attendees\nFlying in from 50+ Countries\n16 Talks from JS Leaders\n20+ Sponsors\n\nAll part of the Largest Javascript Conference in the Netherlands\n\nSign up and be first to get notified about Frontend Love 2020 \nhttps://confirmsubscription.com/h/t/DD88027477DDD5A4\n\nFollow us on Socials\nLinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/company/frontendlove\nTwitter https://twitter.com/Frontend_Love\nFacebook https://www.facebook.com/frontendlove/\nInstagram https://www.instagram.com/frontend_love/\n\nPowered by Passionate People\n\nWant to join their quest to be the lead Software Development Consultancy on the planet? ;)\n\nhttps://passionatepeople.io/careers\n\nFollow on Social\nLinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/company/passionatepeoplefrontend\nTwitter https://twitter.com/passionpeopleNL?s=20\n\n#frontendlove #frontenddeveloperlove #vuejsamsterdam #vueamsterdam"
