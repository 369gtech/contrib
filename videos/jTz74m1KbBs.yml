description: "As software architects we want to make our systems more performant, maintainable, understandable, or any other thing-able. We use infrastructure like Azure Service Bus or Service Fabric. Maybe we'll introduce patterns like CQRS and Event Sourcing. Many of these choices introduce eventual consistency, but users expect immediate consistency. They don't want to wait for eventually. They expect feedback now. There are, however, ways to work around this. So what exactly is eventual consistency and how can we make it work? In this session, we'll have a look at different patterns, both in the user interface and the back end, that give our users immediate feedback even though the back-end system is not. We'll discuss how to solve the complexity of dealing with eventual consistency, without sacrificing decomposability or performance.\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
