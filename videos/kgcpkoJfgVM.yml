title: 'Pattern Matching + SQL Macros = Pure SQL Awesomeness!'
language: English
recordingDate: 1592482120
description: "Added in Oracle Database 12c, SQL pattern matching (match_recognize) makes it easy to answer many questions that were hard-to-impossible with SQL.\n\nBut turning match_recognize clauses into reusable functions was tricky at best.\n\nNo more!\n\nAdded in 19.6, SQL macros enable you to define reusable code fragments. These return SQL that becomes part of your final SQL statement. \n\n**********\n\nAskTOM Office Hours offers free, monthly training and tips on how to make the most of Oracle Database, from Oracle product managers, developers and evangelists.\n\nhttps://asktom.oracle.com/ \n\nOracle Developers portal: https://developer.oracle.com/\nSign up for an Oracle Cloud trial: https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/\n\nThis session will show you how you can combine SQL macros and match_recogize. Together these enable you to write generic functions answering common questions such as \"find me all the consecutive rows\"."
