description: "Filmed at https://2017.dotgo.eu on November 6th in Paris. More talks on https://dotconferences.com/talks\n\nThe Go team is starting to think about Go 2. Marcel addresses some of the current issues with handling errors in Go and introduces a burner package that addresses these issues by introducing a unified model of error, defer, and panic.\n\nAlthough this package can simplify Go code today, he hopes that experience with this package can help us understand how error handling can be improved at the language level."
