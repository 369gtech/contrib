title: 'JP Bader - Plug-n-Stream Player Piano: Signal Processing With Python - PyCon 2019'
recordingDate: 1557111000
description: "\"Speaker: JP Bader\n\nDigital Signal Processing and Player Piano don't normally come together in the same sentance. Player Pianos that are 100+ years old are awesome artisan artifacts, but they don't play digital formats very well. This talk will show how we take a 100+ year old technology and marry it to the digital age via Python libraries and precision lasers! \n\nIn this discussion we will cover how we are creating our own \"\"Plug-n-Stream Player Piano\"\". We will take a look at the different digital signal processing Python libraries, their functionality, and requirements for converting audio streams to piano playable audio files. After a brief walk through of our prototyped hardware, we will dissect the digital signal processing, converting streaming music to data for the Player Piano. With a real Player Piano in the room we will demo streaming music from our devices onto the piano. \n\nLIVE(ish) Piano Playing!\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2019 and https://github.com/PyCon/2019-slides\""
