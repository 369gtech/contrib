description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2013 in Santa Clara, CA\nSpeaker: Lyndon Adams\nAs Information Technology evolves and improves, the demands of industry and the internet continue to challenge its capabilities. Today's 'Internet of Things', with millions of devices reporting their status on the network every second, produces massive streams of events. Getting the information in these events consumed and correlated so that it can be used to make routing and processing decisions on related events is particularly challenging. As the data demands of these processes increases, traditional client-server architectures begin to fail. Combining event processing with patterns and knowledge gleamed from Big Data models enables whole new kinds of real-time applications. Spring Integration and other Spring projects play a big role in this new paradigm, adding developer productivity and ease of integration into the mix. Lyndon will discuss and demonstrate the architectural decisions and use cases that occur when Fast Data meets Big Data."
