title: '"Your Escape Plan From Numpy + Cython" - Cheng-Lin Yang (PyConline AU 2020)'

description: "Cheng-Lin Yang\n\nhttps://2020.pycon.org.au/program/Y3SXGF\n\nIf you've been a data scientist or researcher long enough, you must have encountered a situation where your NumPy code ran quickly on small datasets in a testing environment but performed poorly on real-world datasets (100x larger or more). In this talk, I will introduce three Pythonic solutions to improve NumPy performance drastically without modifying too many codes.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the talk, a math equation: logsumexp, which is widely used in machine learning, will be illustrated. I will show how it is implemented with pure NumPy and use it as a benchmark so we can compare it to three proposed solutions at the end of the talk.\r\n\r\nThen, three solutions: CuPy, Numba, and Pythran will be presented in separate sections. In each section, I will give a brief introduction to the solution and show how to apply this solution to our benchmark code.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the talk, I will compare these solutions from different aspects:\r\n\r\n    * How much performance is boosted after each solution is applied\r\n    * Ease to apply on your existing code (including the ease of debugging)\r\n    * Limitations of each solution\r\n    * Which solution should be applied first in given scenarios\r\n\r\nLast but not the least, I will show a relatively new but interesting solution: Transonic to the audience so they can give it a try on their side project.\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, PyConline\n\nSat Sep  5 16:00:00 2020 at Obvious"
