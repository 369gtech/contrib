title: '2.9: Regular Expressions: replace() - Programming with Text'
language: English
recordingDate: 1474319425
description: "In this video, I cover the JavaScript function replace().  The function allows you to search for a string (by matching a regular expression) and replace that string.  The replacement can be a literal string itself or you can pass in a callback where you can use logic and programming to generate a replacement string based on anything you can imagine.\n\nThis is the ninth video in a series on Regular Expressions, which is part of the \"Programming from A to Z\" course at ITP (http://itp.nyu.edu). \n\nNext Video: https://youtu.be/AKuW48WeNMA\n\nhttp://shiffman.net/a2z/regex/\n\nCourse url: http://shiffman.net/a2z/\n\nSupport this channel on Patreon: https://patreon.com/codingtrain\n\nSend me your questions and coding challenges!: https://github.com/CodingTrain/Rainbow-Topics\n\nContact: https://twitter.com/shiffman\n\nGitHub Repo with all the info for Programming from A to Z: https://github.com/shiffman/A2Z-F16\n\nLinks discussed in this video:\nMDN's Regular Expressions Reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions\nRegular Expressions on Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression\nBook Mastering Regular Expressions: http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596528126.do\nITP from Tisch School of the Arts: https://tisch.nyu.edu/itp\n \nSource Code for the all Video Lessons: https://github.com/CodingTrain/Rainbow-Code\n\np5.js: https://p5js.org/\nProcessing: https://processing.org\n\nFor More Programming from A to Z videos: https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman/playlists?shelf_id=11&view=50&sort=dd\n\nFor More Coding Challenges: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZiZxtDDRCi6uhfTH4FilpH\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/Vy9V/"
