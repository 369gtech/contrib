title: 'Going low level with TCP sockets and :gen_tcp - Orestis Markou - ElixirConf EU 2018'
language: English
recordingDate: 1525085998
description: "TCP sockets are used everywhere, though most of the time the details are hidden in high-level APIs and protocols. However, the BEAM makes writing such low-level network code a breeze — this talk will give a brief overview of how Erlang’s built-in :gen_tcp can be used to build low-level client and server applications.\n\nThe audience should be already familiar with Elixir code and some core BEAM concepts such as processes and messages.\n\nVisit the ElixirConfEU website for slides: http://www.elixirconf.eu/elixirconfeu2018/orestis-markou"
