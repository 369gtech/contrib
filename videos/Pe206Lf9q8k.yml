description: "The talk from Embedded Fest 2021 ONLINE\nFb: https://www.facebook.com/EmbeddedFest/\nWebsite: https://www.embeddedfest.com\n\nLinux Kernel is a core part of operation system. If it's not robust enough, it's not stable, hackers can find and use vulnerabilities or even destroy your system and data.\nHow many times you've seen strange and unpredictable Linux Kernel behavior, crashes in random places, memory leaks, undefined behavior? Debugging and rootcausing of all that cases was very difficult for the years, but recently Linux Kernel gained support of very useful runtime tools and checkers like memory leak detector, address sanitizers and others effectively helping developers in their work.\nOn this session we will look at that tools and checkers implementation detais and see how they helped to fix real issues and harden Linux Kernel"
