description: "JSLA May 31st, 2012 - John Bender @johnbender\nMath, it's certainly not something you expect to see in a presentation about JavaScript, but even this far from its ivory towers it has an important role to play.\n\nTogether we'll build two categories and see how, by satisfying the category and functor laws, we can optimize our jQuery plugins and methods.\n\nDon't worry, you don't need a background in Math just some curiosity and a desire to speed up your jQuery!"
