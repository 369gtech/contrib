description: "I felt bad since we did the last video without much explanation of some of properties of integrals we used. This week's video is optional but it goes deeper into some of those properties.\n\nNew video every Thursday. Question? Leave a comment below, or ask me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/VinoBS"
