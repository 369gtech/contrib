title: 'Supercharging Reflective Libraries with InvokeDynamic'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433254605
description: "Reflection is a powerful tool but has traditionally carried with it a performance penalty. This session shows how a combination of InvokeDynamic and bytecode generation can be used to transform a traditional reflection-based library into one in which there is almost no performance penalty. To do so, the presentation starts with a brief need-to-know overview of JVM bytecode and the InvokeDynamic protocol. It then walks through creating a simple JSON marshaling library by using ASM bytecode generation and InvokeDynamic and shows how hand-rolled marshaling code can be rivaled in performance. Techniques for testing this code, including security policies, are also covered.\n\n\nAuthor:\nIan Robertson\nIan Robertson is an Application Architect for Myriad Genetics.
