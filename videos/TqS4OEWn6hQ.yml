title: 'Pavel Yosifovich — Writing a .NET Core cross platform profiler in an hour'
language: Russian
recordingDate: 1583854393
description: "Ближайшая конференция — DotNext 2020 Moscow\n2-5 декабря, Online\nПодробности и билеты: https://dotnext-moscow.ru/\n\n. NET supports injecting an instrumentation profiler, built as a C++ COM component, that can be loaded into any .NET process. With .NET Core, the profiler mechanism is extended to work on non-Windows platforms as well. In this almost demo-only session we’ll build a simple, yet functional, cross-platform .NET Core profiler and run it on Windows and Linux."
