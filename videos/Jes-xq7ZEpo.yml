description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nKubernetes? But I'm a Product Manager… - Matthew McNeeney, Independent & Miguel Luna, VMware \n\nGood product teams care deeply about their users and the experience they provide to them, yet many Product Managers shy away from conversations about Kubernetes, believing that it’s something for their engineering counterparts to think about. But this is a critical mistake; many of the benefits Kubernetes brings can be harnessed to deliver better products, faster.  The Kubernetes.io tagline is ‘Production-Grade Container Orchestration’, so it’s easy to see why Product Managers tend to leave it aside as an engineering concern. But much of the innovative work happening in the ecosystem can be used to ship software faster and deliver great user experiences. This talk will cover how Product Managers building different types of software can utilise features in Kubernetes to build extensible, scalable and cloud-agnostic products that drive better customer outcomes.\n\nhttps://sched.co/ZenX"
