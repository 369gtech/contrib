title: 'Machines that Judge Us - Boris Kourtoukov'
language: English
recordingDate: 1543523623
description: 'As part of my residency at the V2_ Lab for the Unstable Media I gave a voice to a set of physical machines. These machines would normally make their decisions about us in silence, online and offline. Decisions like: which ads would affect us most, how valuable are we to them, and what we get to see and hear in our digital lives. The hope is that by giving these machines voice we can parallel their judgement of us with the much more visceral experience of being judged by a human. In this talk I provide examples from the exhibition and go into the details of implementing these voices with core.logic, a bit on NLP, and interfacing with computer vision.'
