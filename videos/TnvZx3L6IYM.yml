title: '"Musings of an Accidental Chair - change from the inside out" - Lyndsey Jackson (LCA 2020)'
recordingDate: 1579223120
description: "Lyndsey Jackson\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/65/\n\nIn 2017 Lyndsey became the Chair of Electronic Frontiers Australia. Over the past two years the EFA board and volunteers have worked to increase engagement, participation, and be more effective - not easy when everyone is a volunteer. How have we reached this nexus where underfunded and under supported organisations and individuals are the key line of defense in speaking up for digital rights, security, privacy and ethics? Strengthening community partnerships has meant strengthening internal operations, and juggling the balance of keeping an organisations lights on. And that alone doesn't leave much time for deep strategy on community messaging and public engagement. \r\n\r\nHow can we do better? Lyndsey entered into the world of digital rights via her campaign work building the website and social media accounts for #notmydebt, which provided a voice for people affected by robodebt. This campaign proved people do care about rights, the impact of automation, and maintaining integrity in Australian values, systems and government. Survey after survey tells us Australian's care about privacy and security, and as technologists we hold the tools, networks, and the expertise to shape a better future. Let's scope the work we all need to do, together.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
