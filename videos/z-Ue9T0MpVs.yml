description: "PyData NYC 2018\n\nThis is an overview of what I learned about web apps while building the Trending service for ShopRunner. It will focus on details that are critical to performant, production systems but that are often left out of the online literature aimed at data scientists. This will include dealing with updating data, enabling scrolling feeds, errors and the canonical use of HTTP status codes, and performance.\n===\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
