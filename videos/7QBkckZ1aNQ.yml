description: "RubyConf 2018 - RubyPlot - Creating a Plotting Library for Ruby by Pranav Garg\n\nThe talk introduces Rubyplot - the plotting library created for Ruby. It focuses on the general design of a plotting library, its influence from John Hunter's Matplotlib, the design decisions that were influenced by Ruby and provides a perspective of the language from the eyes of a newcomer.\n\nThe talk further argues why Ruby should be used for scientific computing and urges Rubyists to contribute to the development of scientific frameworks."
