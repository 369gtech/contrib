description: "Recording brought to you by American Express https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs\nAs of Gradle 5.0, you can now author your build scripts in Kotlin. You will discover a much richer IDE experience through editor assistance, better refactoring and debugging.\n\nIn this live coding session, we walk through several Groovy-based build examples and convert them to Kotlin: demonstrating Gradle Kotlin DSL features and best practices so that you can take your build to the next level.\n\nAbout the Presenter:\nPaul Merlin is an experienced, self-made, software engineer with a wide knowledge ranging from computers, network security and architectures to high-level programming langages, domain modeling and cryptography. 39 years old, hobbyist at 7 already, Paul professionally started to build softwares in 2000. He joined the Gradle team three years ago, on time for 2.14, participated to the big performance efforts that went into the 3.x and 4.x versions and works on the Gradle Kotlin DSL since then."
