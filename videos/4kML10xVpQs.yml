description: "Every application has its limits. Often these limits manifest themselves only when it is running in production under real load. Learn in this session how you can get visibility into the JVM internals without requiring host access and without incurring additional overhead on your JVM. Observe the application threads as they transition over time, understand resource utilization, and detect bottlenecks in the code. And get to know how to debug deadlocks and hung threads on a running server by observing stack frames and local variables and how to deal with application memory utilization inefficiencies.\n\nSpeakers:\nMichael Avrahamov, Sr. Director of Software Development, Oracle\n\nAvi Huber, Senior Director, Oracle\n\nXuemei Xi, Consulting Member of Technical Staff, Oracle\nShe has 10+ of industry experience with a development focus on platform, performance, and performance monitoring and diagnosis"
