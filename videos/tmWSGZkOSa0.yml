description: "Slides: https://speakerdeck.com/istanbultechtalks/itt-2014-orta-therox-mobile-and-the-art-world\n\nWhen Artsy released a mobile app we had to re-think how we could translate an ever changing web experience into something small and beautiful. We built it with a tight time-frame, a small team and a collection of ever changing specs and iOS betas. Orta will discuss the ways that they dealt with the aftermath of 3 months sprinting, and 2 months cleanup before another release could happen. How we built the mobile Artsy website simultaneously so that there was always a backup. And finally where the app is now, and how both visually and architecturally the app is changing to slowly become as elegant as the works presented inside it."
