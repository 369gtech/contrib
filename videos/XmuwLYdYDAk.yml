description: "Any developer that worked on a software projects, considered at one point few things like how fast his/her function is, how much test coverage do they have, or if there is a better way to recompile their code without a need to restart JVM. All of these questions can be answered by Aspect Oriented Programming.\n\nAspect Oriented Programming (AOP) is a cross-cutting concern of writing code across modules to bring a common feature to variety of methods, classes and packages. To illustrate, AOP allows developers to see which parts of actual code was triggered by a test, or to see performance metrics of a certain function. These examples can also be extended to how JVM sees source code and goes beyond Hot Swap in recompiling in runtime using Aspect Oriented Programming.\n\nThis talkâ€™s main goal is to show a real power of AOP with focus on how it is already used in the industry, and how any engineer can write their own AOP application, or Java Agent. As a part of this talk, the speaker will cover common Open Source Java Agents such as JaCoCo and JMH, and touch based on paid-base Java Agents such as JRebel or AppDynamics."
