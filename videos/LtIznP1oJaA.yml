description: "Case Study: How Process Follows Product\r\n\nLarge products can be created only by chopping them into smaller pieces to be worked on by separate teams. In this presentation I will share my observations in a product company of how the chosen architecture of the product influences the processes of four different teams. This affects both the processes of specific teams and processes between teams working on different parts of the product. Aim of the presentation is to illustrate the dynamics of the relation between product, organisation, and processes."
