title: 'Finding the Longest Common Substring and Gestalt Pattern Matching'
language: English
recordingDate: 1603281287
description: "In this session Stew Ashton joins Chris Saxon to discuss a recent question on Ask TOM: implementing the Ratcliff-Obershelp similarity algorithm to rank how similar two strings are.\n\nThis works by recursively finding common substrings in the source words. Stew and Chris discuss how to do this using SQL and PL/SQL, comparing the performance of various solutions to find the fastest method. \n\nThe winner may surprise you (hint: it's not SQL)."
