title: 'YOW! 2012 Erik Doernenburg - Architecture Without Architects'
language: English
recordingDate: 1513433071
description: "The title software architect comes with many connotations, and often these are not good. Developers think of hand-waivers who inhabit ivory towers and have forgotten how to write code. Project managers think of technologists who are chasing perfection in initiatives that are serving obscure technical purposes. Yet, for the success of any software project architecture is crucial. In this talk Erik will present his experience on how to address this issue, introducing techniques that help teams come up with good designs and sustainable architectures without the need for a superstar architect. Topics include evolutionary architecture, the seductive power of abstractions, vertical slicing, software visualisations, and the need to experience the consequences of decisions.\n\nErik is software developer, consultant, and Head of Technology at ThoughtWorks. He helps clients with building enterprise software, always on the look out for innovative technology that creates new potential. Frequent exposure to overly complex architectures has made him interested in simple designs and software visualisation as means to help people better understand architecture. Erik's career in enterprise software began in the early nineties on the NeXTSTEP platform, and throughout his career he has been an advocate of agile values and open source software. Over the past ten years, he has spoken at many international conferences, contributed to several books, and maintained a couple of open source projects. Software Passion: I'm passionate about simplicity in software architecture and visualisation as a way of exposing accidental complexity in code and architecture Professional Contributions: CCMenu 97 Things Every Software Architect Should Know Applying Domain-Driven Design and Patterns OCMock\n\nFor more on YOW!
