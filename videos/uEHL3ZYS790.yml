title: 'Mozilla Project Things Workshop'
recordingDate: 1549787375
description: "kathy giori\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/163/\n\nCome learn about Mozilla’s Project Things initiative. It is an open source implementation aimed at promoting a decentralized, and W3C-standardized, Web of Things framework for managing IoT device data. Mozilla’s implementation puts people first, protecting user privacy and security, while promoting industry interoperability.\r\n\r\nObjectives: Attendees will learn how to set up a private IoT gateway, and how to to program MCU hardware by following an online tutorial, that takes advantage of open source “webthing” libraries.\r\n\r\nPrerequisites: No prior developer skills are necessary. Bring a laptop (any OS). Attendees will be provided with a developer board that they can program during the workshop, and continue to use later by following an online tutorial. Prototyping hardware is generally low cost, and readily available.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
