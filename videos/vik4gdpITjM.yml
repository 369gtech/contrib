description: "NorDevCon 2014 - 28th February 2014\n\nOrleans \nby Richard Asbury \n(@Richorama) \n\nKnown for underpinning the Halo 4 server-side components, Orleans offers an actor based approach to programming for the cloud. This simplifies the programming model by removing shared state and thread safety concerns, and unlocks the potential for huge horizontal scale out. Orleans is a great fit for online computer games, but is also applicable in other areas, from business applications to the Internet of Things.\n\nThe talk is an overview of the architecture, and a live coding demonstration.\n\nRichard has had early access to the technology, which is not currently publicly available.\n\n\nhttp://www.nordevcon.com/nordevcon2014/"
