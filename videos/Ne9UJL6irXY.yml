description: "Ingress V2 and Multicluster Services - Rohit Ramkumar & Bowei Du, Google \n\nWith app modernization, we’ve entered a new phase of structuring services. Services have evolved over time to span multiple clusters as well as hybrid deployments that encompass both on-prem and multiple clouds. There are several use cases for multiple Kubernetes clusters: canarying new versions of your app, or low latency access for your users across the globe. In this session, we will present a new version of the Ingress and the Service APIs. These API’s form the foundational blocks for managing your global, scalable and reliable services close to your users using a single control plane. Moreover, we will compare these new API’s with different models for spreading services across multiple cluster (e.g Istio). We will demo a custom controller we have written that will configure multi-cluster HTTP(S) load balancing given these new API’s. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPb6"
