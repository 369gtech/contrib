description: "Sometimes you get things wrong and cause security problems. When Microsoft gets things wrong we cause patch Tuesday and reboot France. This session will go through what caused a few of the ASP.NET and .NET MSRC cases, although the concepts and sometimes the vulnerabilities also occur in Java, Ruby, PHP and more. Barry will show you how you could also have made the same mistakes... and how you can fix them.\n\nThe speech took place on 9th of May on Crypto & Security Stage during Infoshare 2019 in Gdansk, Poland.\n\n#Security #.NET #Crypto&Security #SoftwareEngineering #Tech"
