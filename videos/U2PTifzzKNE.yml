description: "A Kubernetes Application End-to-End: DevStats - Łukasz Gryglicki, CNCF & Josh Berkus, Red Hat \n\nYou may know DevStats as a repository of contributor statistics for Kubernetes (devstats.cncf.io), but you're about to find out that it is also a great demonstration case of migrating a complete application to orchestrated microservices. Our community has lacked solid, production-quality, end-to-end, all-open-source application examples, so we decided to make DevStats into one. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPZG"
