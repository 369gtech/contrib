description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2016\n—\nAlgorithms and the Concepts that enable them (Range and Iterator) are designed to work over values distributed in space (VDiS). The algorithms in std and the rangev3 proposal and the parallel algorithm are all focused on efficiently utilizing every resource assigned to them to process values distributed in space. Whenever values are distributed in space, these are the tools to use. \n\nValues distributed in time (VDiT) require different Concepts and Algorithms. This talk will explore some of these Algorithms and the requirements that they impose on the Concepts. The result is a library that composes algorithms the same way that the rangev3 proposal does and in a way that allows knowledge of one to transfer to the other.\n— \nKirk Shoop\nPrincipal Software Engineer, Microsoft\nRx Cpp, Asynchronous Algorithms, catching code errors at compile time.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
