description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io\_The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nKubernetes Transforms Cloud Infrastructure for Local Life Services Giant - Guoliang Wang, Meituan-Dianping \n\nMeituan-Dianping is a world leading local life service platform. Migrating cloud infrastructure like it to Kubernetes is not easy. This road is complex and difficult, but it’s all worth it.  In this talk, they will share the lessons learned from their work in the past two years from a technical perspective, including:  1. What are the main obstacles and benefits to large-scale cloud infrastructure migration from OpenStack to Kubernetes?  2. What’s the future of VM? How to avoid maintaining two cloud infrastructure systems? All(containers and VMs) run on Kubernetes.  3. How do we deal with the problems of reliability and efficiency brought by large-scale Kubernetes cluster and dozens of clusters?  4. What are the main technical flaws that hinder cloud native? How to do that if your application management is different from Kubernetes and you have to rely on your existing infrastructure? \n\nhttps://sched.co/cp88"
