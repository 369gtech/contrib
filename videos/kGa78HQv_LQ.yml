description: "Presented at Reaktor Dev Day 2012\nReaktor Dev Day is a conference for developers by developers. Organized on Oct 19th in Helsinki, Finland it attracted over 300 enthusiastic developers. Topics included Haskell, Python, JavaScript, FP, Data security and Bacon.js.\n\nFor more information, please visit \nreaktordevday.fi/\nreaktor.fi/en/\n\nIt's an article of conventional wisdom that languages with a lot of expressive power offer an unhappy tradeoff: you gain ease of development, but lose runtime performance. In this talk, we'll look at real-world performance concerns in two very different languages, Haskell and Python. We'll cover some useful and occasionally surprising tricks and tools that help us to write faster code, and what happens when we break out the \"big guns\" of rewriting code in C."
