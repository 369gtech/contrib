description: "While not new technology, distributed tracing has caught quite a buzz in recent years. Like all trendy tech, it can be difficult to distill reality from hype. If you haven’t heard of it yet, distributed tracing allows you to understand a single request as it crosses an arbitrarily complex (microservice or not) architecture. \n\nThe Zipkin community has helped many new folks understand what is marketing from what is real, leading to numerous site deployments. This session aims to share our “Sites” project, which is an inventory of real-life setups people use today. These sites employ distributed tracing to increase developer productivity or reduce time in triage. \n\nBy the end of this talk, you’ll not only learn concrete examples of what tracing is all about, but you’ll also get a connection to the community. We’ll introduce you to the gitter (chat) channel where everyone involved is. You can leverage us to begin or enhance your journey in observability.\n\nSpeakers: Adrian Cole, Zipkin guy, Pivotal; Tommy Ludwig, Software Developer, Pivotal; Narayanan Arunachalam, Senior Software Engineer, Netflix\n\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2019\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/distributed-tracing-in-the-wild"
