description: "Speaker: Marco A. Gutiérrez (Robolab, University of Extremadura, Spain)\n\nTalk of 60 minutes\n\nOpen Detection (OD) is a novel standalone open source project for object detection and recognition in images and 3D point clouds. Open Detection is released under the terms of the BSD license, and thus free for commercial and research use. The project was originated under Google Summer of Code 2015 with the aim of having a vision tool for robotics (in particular for Robocomp, an open source robotics framework). The library is built with a very specific goal - to answer the fundamental problem of Computer Vision - Object Recognition and Detection. We make available to everyone the existing solution in this direction in a common, intuitive and user-friendly APIs. Our simple and user-friendly APIs make this a great tool for Robotics Applications and robots and Computer Vision beginners and enthusiasts. And of course, the method dependent parameters to fine-tune detections to the limit, makes this a great tool for Computer Vision researchers and experts.\n\nAbout Marco A. Gutiérrez:\n\nMarco A. Gutiérrez is a PhD student in cognitive vision for robotics systems at the Robotics and Artificial Vision Laboratory (RoboLab) from the University of Extremadura, Spain since 2011. He is currently holding an A*STAR Research Attachment Programme (ARAP) scholarship in the Human Language Technology Department at I2R, A*STAR, Singapore. He has contributed to several open-source robotics and computer vision related projects like RoboComp and the Point Cloud Library as organization administrator and mentor (respectively) for several editions of the Google Summer of Code programme (2013, 2014 and 2015).\n\nEvent Page: http://2016.fossasia.org/schedule/#BD-20\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/WCbz/"
