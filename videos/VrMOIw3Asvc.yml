language: English
recordingDate: 1625275245
description: "Join us on this weekly Office Hours for Oracle Machine Learning on Autonomous Database, where our experts will explore exciting new features, show cool demos, and answer any questions, from simple to complex.\n\nThe Oracle Machine Learning product family supports data scientists, analysts, developers, and IT to achieve data science project goals faster while taking full advantage of the Oracle platform.\n\nThe Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks offers an easy-to-use, interactive, multi-user, collaborative interface based on Apache Zeppelin notebook technology, and support SQL, PL/SQL, Python and Markdown interpreters. It is available on all Autonomous Database versions and Tiers, including the always-free editions.\n\nOML includes AutoML, which provides automated machine learning algorithm features for algorithm selection, feature selection and model tuning, in addition to a specialized AutoML UI exclusive to the Autonomous Database.\n\nOML Services is also included in Autonomous Database, where you can deploy and manage native in-database OML models as well as ONNX ML models (for classification and regression) built using third-party engines, and can also invoke cognitive text analytics.\n\nVideo Highlights\n00:28 Topics for the Session: OML4Py REST API\n02:33 Demo on OML4Py Notebook using Autonomous Database\n02:54 Build SciKit-Learn Random Forest Classifier and Store in OML Data Store\n05:09 Oracle Machine Learning Random Forest model build and store\n07:54 Scoring code for SciKit Learn RF model\n09:34 Scoring code for OML RF model\n11:51 Creating both OML4Py Scoring Functions \n16:08 Store Scripts for both Scikit Learn and OML model in the OML4Py Script Repository\n16:31 Check functionality of Scikit Learn Predict script and OML4Py *Apply() functions\n19:29 Check functionality of OML Predict script and OML4Py *Apply() functions\n21:34 Accessing predictions from REST APIs - Postman demo\n21:58 REST API scoring for SciKit Learn Random Forest Classifier\n23:36 REST API scoring for OML Random Forest model\n25:08 Q&A"
