description: "Cloud Native Buildpacks: A Paradigm Shift for Enterprise App Builds - Stephen Levine & Ben Hale, Pivotal Software, Inc.\n\nThe Cloud Native Buildpacks project was initiated by Pivotal and Heroku in January 2018 and joined the Cloud Native Sandbox in October 2018. The project aims to unify the buildpack ecosystems with a platform-to-buildpack contract that is well-defined and that incorporates learnings from maintaining production-grade buildpacks for years at both Pivotal and Heroku.\n\nIn this presentation, Stephen Levine and Ben Hale (CNB Project Owners at Pivotal) will discuss the features and benefits of Cloud Native Buildpacks in the context of the core CF Buildpacks and CF Java Buildpacks projects in the CF Extensions PMC. Topics will include using buildpacks outside of CFAR, and upcoming changes to the current Cloud Foundry buildpacks.\n\nAbout Ben Hale\nBen Hale leads Pivotal’s Java Cloud Foundry efforts including being a founding member of the Cloud Native Buildpacks CNCF Sandbox project and leading the Cloud Foundry Java Buildpack. In addition to this work, he’s very involved in the Reactive Programming scene founding the Reactive Relational Database Connectivity (R2DBC) project, being a spec lead and committer on the RSocket Reactive networking protocol, and being a long-time contributor to Project Reactor. In what little spare time he has left, Ben loves riding his bike, especially in the high mountains of the Italian Dolomites.\n\nAbout Stephen Levine\nStephen Levine is a Pivotal product manager and software engineer. He is the Cloud Foundry Project Lead for CF Local, CF Dev, and the core CF Buildpacks, as well as a co-owner of the Cloud Native Buildpacks project in the CNCF's Cloud Native Sandbox.\n\nhttps://www.cloudfoundry.org/"
