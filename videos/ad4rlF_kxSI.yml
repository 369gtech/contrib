description: "Paul Wilson - Programmer, speaker, founder, CEO Cultivate Software\n\nA production-grade Nerves system\n\nTalk in three words: Taking Nerves seriously\n\nAbstract\nCultivate’s “Office Window System” is a view into the office for their remote employees. It consists of cameras on Pi Zeros relaying websocket-based streams through a cloud-based Phoenix server. Paul will show how they made the system: robust, secure, and performant. He will demonstrate developing and unit-testing nerves code on development hardware, using umbrella applications to separate concerns, and using OTP supervision trees to make an ultra-reliable system despite intermittent library bugs.\n\nObjectives\nTo give a detailed overview of making this Nerves system, with a particular emphasis on robustness, quality, and extensibility. \n\nAudience\nThis talk will be of interest to Elixir programmers who are interested in how to take Nerves beyond toy applications.\n\nThe speaker \nPaul is a coder with over 20 years experience, including working with C, C++, Visual Basic, Java, Ruby, and Elixir. Paul has spoken at various conferences including RubyConf, Elixir Conf EU, The Naked Agilist, Agile Scotland, XP Conf.\n\nWhile Paul is now CEO of Cultivate Software, he still codes and is overly proud of the small contributions he has made to Elixir Core, Nerves, and Phoenix.\n Github: paulanthonywilson\nTwitter: @paulanthonywils\n\nElixirConf EU\nWebsite: www.elixirconf.eu\nTwitter: www.twitter.com/elixirconfeu\nMail: info at elixirconfeu"
