description: "Speaker: Mizanur Rahman, Telenor Health A/S\n\nWe are very much obsessed or bound to use a fixed structural database design for our projects. The traditional column based table design along with normalization makes our life crippled within lots of tables and joins. The BLOB was there but was not flexible enough to be used everywhere. JSON is one of the most used structure for data transmission from one service to another and also storing in the database. It gives flexibility to store a structure data as a JSON object and performs operation on the JSON object through queries. Many developers are not aware of this great gem inside their database engine and end up creating larger tables with lots of columns or many tables to keep the database normalized. In this talk I want to focus on JSON data structure and PostgreSQL support for it. From my professional experience of scaling service for 20 million users and millions of records every day, I want to share the experience and how you can we work with it with a practical demo.\n\nAbout the speaker\nI am Mizanur Rahman, a PHP fanatic who loves to dig deeper in PHP and related technologies.
