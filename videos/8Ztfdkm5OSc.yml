title: 'Anastasia Rezhepp - Swiss Army man, or What a UX designer consists of'
language: English
recordingDate: 1619689251
description: "\"Want to educate people in your team to be able to make UX decisions? Or just to be able to talk with the design team understanding what they tell you? Or you decided to pivot your career, and turn from a Java developer to a UX designer (never saw anything like that, but who knows!)?\n\nThe UX people, in our opinion, consist of a very special combination of structural mind, good visual taste, technologies proficiency, and communication skills. Iâ€™ll describe each of these parts in detail, and tell how we educate people for them to move further. A few cases when something happened wrong because the UX person lacked some of the above, will also be in the story.\""
