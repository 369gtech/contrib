description: "Should the database be used as a persistence layer only, or as a full-fledged processing engine that runs business logic too? We believe that “processing engine” is the right answer. Moreover, we believe that the database should be exposed to client-side programs only by a PL/SQL API. We call this approach the SmartDB paradigm, and we use this name as our Twitter hashtag. \n\nWe argue that SmartDB is the proper way to build correct and secure applications on Oracle Database. We especially like that the approach brings, as a happy side-effect, best performance and maintainability.\n\nUse these sessions to put any and all questions that you might have about  SmartDB to Bryn Llewellyn and Toon Koppelaars.\n\n\nAskTOM Office Hours offers free, monthly training and tips on how to make the most of Oracle Database, from Oracle product managers, developers and evangelists.\n\nhttps://asktom.oracle.com/\n\nOracle Developers portal: https://developer.oracle.com/\nSign up for an Oracle Cloud trial: https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/tryit\n\n#smartdb #performance"
