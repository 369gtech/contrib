description: "The US is amid its largest measles outbreak since 1992, with 1,250 cases as of Oct 3, 2019. Most cases (649) were in NYC, where the outbreak was declared over on Sep 3, 2019. This tutorial creates data visualizations to help understand the measles outbreak in NYC. Bubble maps and bar charts are created using Python (bokeh, matplotlib) and following principles of clarity and context.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.
