language: English

description: 'Although security is a crucial aspect for any application, its implementation can be difficult. Worse, itâ€™s often neglected, poorly implemented and intrusive. However, lately security servers have made it possible to delegate all authentication and authorization aspects. Have you ever seen a ''Log in with Facebook'' button and wonder how that works? We have some answers. This session delves into widely used OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect standards, explains what is JWT and why should we use it as well as shows how to delegate authentication and authorization concerns of your custom applications by integrating them with one of the most promising, open-source implementation of an OAuth-based authorization server called Keycloak. It will also be discussed how a matter of security can fall into two categories: stateful and stateless which, subsequently, has huge impact on cloud-readiness of our applications.'
