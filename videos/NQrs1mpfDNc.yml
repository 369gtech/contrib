description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nIn a Container, Nobody Hears Your Screams: Next Generation Process Isolation - Andrew Martin, ControlPlane \n\nIs it ever safe to run untrusted code in containers? Should process isolation keep workloads in, or attackers out? What would it take to run a malware test lab in Kubernetes?  With fast startup times and consistent execution environments containers beat traditionally slow, monolithic VMs -- but with the advancement of micro VMs the boundaries have become blurred. It is increasingly difficult to know which isolation technology to choose for our next application. Can we run different workloads in different “container” types -- on the same cluster?  In this talk we: - examine the history of trying to safely run unsafe processes - compare and contrast the emerging generation of process isolation and security techniques - rationalise the design decisions that drive each project - demo how to break in, out, and learn about what workloads are best suited to run in each technology\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zerb"
