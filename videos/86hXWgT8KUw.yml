language: English
recordingDate: 1620144355
description: "If you’ve ever gotten a certificate for a course, back end administration is not your concern once you pass. But emailing certificates can be a tedious process for the training company. \n\nHesham Abu Elenain notices how little things like this add up to a lot of time. Elenain is a senior Oracle Application Express [APEX] developer for the Alexandria Port Authority in Egypt, and fond of using Oracle APEX to solve all sorts of problems inside and outside of work. When a friend who runs a training business asked him to create a tool to make it easier to prepare certificates for workshop attendees, he jumped in to help. \n\n“My idea was to use Oracle APEX and JasperReports to reduce the time from 37 hours to only one minute,” Elenain says. “Yes, only one minute.” \n\nIn this, the first in our APEX App Creator Spotlight article series, Oracle brand journalist Alexa Morales takes a look at two ingenious apps Elenain built with APEX: The aforementioned certificate engine, and a snazzy interactive resume that highlights his skills with dynamically generated JavaScript graphics.\n\nCheck out Hesham's resume here: https://apex.oracle.com/pls/apex/sharko/r/h-apex-cv/home\n\n#appcreator #OracleAPEX"
