description: "PyData New York City 2019\n\nMigrating legacy applications can be daunting. They are frequently large, poorly tested, undermaintained, yet business critical. Over time they may end up relying on deprecated technology and unprepared for changing business needs. Weâ€™ll cover lessons learned in migrating such an application to something maintainable, sharing details on how to go about it in a safe and systematic manner.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
