description: "The Future of Software Development\n\nFrom autonomous vehicles, 3D printed rocket engines, and “affordable” consumer-owned satellites to rapid advances in AI and secure, decentralized electronic currencies, the past several years have shown us that the only prediction we can confidently make about the future is that it will arrive more quickly than any of us imagined. Yet with all of these major technological advances, the way we develop, test, deploy, and manage software has been incrementally changing over the years. Many of the most forward-thinking paradigms, practices, and technologies are based on concepts and even implementations created decades ago.\nHow can software development itself benefit from the disruptive changes in technology in recent years? This talk will explore influences, tech trends and coming innovations which will change how we as an industry approach to software creation, maintenance, management, and even employment.\n\nWrites books, writes and plays music, writes software, leads organizations (currently for Microsoft), invests in startups, speaks at conferences, teaches, learns, organize conferences, etc.\n\nStarted and co-organized a couple of Ruby-related conferences including The International Ruby Conference and RailsConf.\n\nFor more on YOW!
