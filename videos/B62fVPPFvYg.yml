title: '#HITBCyberWeek KEYNOTE 2: The War for Control of DNS Encryption - Paul Vixie'
language: English
recordingDate: 1607242806
description: "Pervasive monitoring of the Internet by both government, corporate, and criminal actors has triggered an encryption wavefront as wide as the Internet itself. DNS, as the map of the Internetâ€™s territory, is seen as especially sensitive and there are now several competing encryption standards waiting to be deployed. In this short talk, Dr. Vixie will explain the original problem, describe the protocol-level solutions, and then show how vendors like Google, Mozilla Corporation, Microsoft, and Apple are deploying these technologies across their product lines. Opinions may also be offered.\n\n\n\n=== \n\n\nDr. Paul Vixie is an internet pioneer. Currently, he is the Chairman, CEO and cofounder of award-winning Farsight Security, Inc. Dr. Vixie was inducted into the internet Hall of Fame in 2014 for work related to DNS and anti-spam technologies. He is the author of open source internet software including BIND 8, and of many internet standards documents concerning DNS and DNSSEC. In addition, he founded the first anti-spam company (MAPS, 1996), the first non-profit internet infrastructure company (ISC, 1994), and the first neutral and commercial internet exchange (PAIX, 1991). In 2018, he cofounded SIE Europe UG, a European data sharing collective to fight cybercrime. Dr. Vixie earned his Ph.D. from Keio University for work related to DNS and DNSSEC in 2010."
