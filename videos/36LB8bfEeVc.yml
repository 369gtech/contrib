You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big it is. It does a lot. Many would say it does too much. For me, the biggest issue is that it combines 2 distinct pieces of functionality — modeling the domain, and abstracting database access.\n\nFor years, I've dreamed of separating these 2, while still staying on Rails' golden path. I finally found a way to do that. The benefits are high: faster tests, simpler code, decoupling from the database, automatic schema migrations — without much downside. Let's take a look and see if it might be for you and your project."
