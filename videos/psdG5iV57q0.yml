description: 'Witchcraft, Algae, and Quark bring several utilities to Elixir from other languages, enabling an easier, principled use of tools such as algebraic data types and monads. Witchcraft''s goal is to feel fully idiomatic, and provide a gentle learning curve for learning the new concepts that it introduces. This talk walked us through the library basics, demonstrating common use cases, and discussed some of the opportunities for integration with the existing Elixir ecosystem.'
