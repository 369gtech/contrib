title: 'Own the future, NSB-style - Udi Dahan'
recordingDate: 1527592204
description: "If you wanted to implement the architectural patterns mentioned in Udi’s “Own the future” presentation, you could figure out how to do UI Composition yourself with Angular and ASP.NET, how to route and scale commands differently from events using queues like RabbitMQ or SQS, and of course monitor it all in production.\n\nBut, in this presentation, we’ll assume you’d rather focus on delivering business value and show you the hands-on programming techniques to do it all, using NServiceBus and the rest of the Particular Service Platform. Whether you’re running on-premises, on AWS, or on Azure – it all just works. For real."
