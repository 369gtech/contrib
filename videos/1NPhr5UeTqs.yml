title: 'Easier infrastructure and safer secrets with Pulumi, Azure, and .Net Core - Rian Finnegan'
language: English
recordingDate: 1605784154
description: "'Infrastructure as code' is best practice for cloud applications. But your apps are complex beasts, with many dependencies and secrets to manage. If you've ever checked secrets into a repository, or had nightmares about ARM templates, then this talk is for you. This session will cover: the basics of using Pulumi to build cloud infrastructure in your favourite programming language; why secret management is important; how to build an .Net Core app so developers never see a secret again; and how to put it all together into a dev-ops pipeline and deploy safely to production.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks at: \nhttps://ndcsydney.com\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/"
