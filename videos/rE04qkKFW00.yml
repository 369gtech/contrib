title: 'Animate the Web with Three.js and GSAP'
language: English
recordingDate: 1629498607
description: "Three.js is a revolutionary open-source cross-platform JavaScript API and library that is used to create and display 3D computer graphics in a desktop web browser using WebGL, working at a high level to create GPU-accelerated animations without the need for plugins or external applications. The library comes packed with features not commonly associated with the web, including on-the-fly lighting effects, multiple camera angles, object geometry & material manipulation, and even VR/AR support through WebXR.\n\nIn this session, weâ€™ll cover the basics of the library and demonstrate how to code websites with 3D backgrounds, as well as show you how to bring 3D models onto the page for a whole new end-user experience you might not have thought possible before.\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).
