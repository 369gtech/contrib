title: 'Flowable business processing from Kafka events by Tijs Rademakers & Joram Barrez'
language: English
recordingDate: 1573162196
description: "We show how Flowable BPM has been extended to interact transparently with Kafka events (other frameworks are available). This enables developers to create abstractions on low level event streams that in turn allows business modelers to describe case and business process management solutions that are driven by messages and events.\n\nWe illustrate how you can achieve scalable and seamless orchestration of microservices, devices and humans through both declarative and procedural high-level models.\n\nTijs is the Flowable project lead, before the Activiti project lead, and involved in open source business process management for over 10 years.\nBefore that he was working as a consultant in BPM and enterprise integration projects.\nHe is the author of the Manning Activiti in Action and Open Source ESB's in action books.\n\nJoram is a Flowable core developer with many yearsâ€™ experience in open-source software and of building scalable process engines. He co-founded the Activiti open-source project (on which Flowable is based) and was a core developer for over six years. Before that he was employed by JBoss/RedHat as part of the jBPM team and started his career as a Java consultant at RealDolmen with a focus on BPM."
