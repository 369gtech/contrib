And why it is they need to run in temperatures below those found in interstellar space? And what is a QPU anyway? \nTo find out, join us in a guided tour with Murray Thom through his labs at D-Wave, the world's first company to sell computers to exploit quantum effects in their operation. This is a rare look inside a quantum computing lab with one of the top frontrunners [...]\n\nRead the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotochgo.com/2020/sessions/1440/a-guided-tour-at-d-wave\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOchgo\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#QuantumComputing #Quantum #QuantumComputers #DWave #QPU\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
