description: "Join me for a live hour of code!  I'll demonstrate the basics of learning to programming using the Processing development environment.  I'll show how to download Processing, write your first lines of code to make a drawing on the screen, and how to make that drawing interactive.  I'll answer your questions live from the chat (and possibly even have a way for you to call in?).\n\nhttp://processing.org\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/Qbt9/"
