description: "Slides and more info: http://www.erlang-factory.com/euc2016/eric-meadowsjonsson\n\nHex is the package manager for the Erlang ecosystem. It has support in the major build tools and languages; Rebar3, erlang.mk and Elixir. Its adoption is growing steadily, now with over a million weekly downloads.\nThis talk will discuss 4 topics around Hex and package managers. The community aspect; why Hex can be more than a code delivery tool and promote good practices in the community. Security; the current security features of Hex and what can be improved in the future such as user-signed packages and probably an append-only repository. The architecture; how Hex is built up, the specifications, how Hex runs and what it runs on. The future; what are the future plans for Hex."
