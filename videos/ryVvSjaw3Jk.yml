title: 'Henry Van Styn (‎vanstyn‎) - ‎RapidApp: turn-key ajaxy web apps‎'
language: English
recordingDate: 1403626226
description: "Overview and live demonstration of the RapidApp web framework (www.rapidapp.info) which provides turn-key web interfaces (Web 2.0/AJAX using ExtJS) that tie automatically into various backend data models.\n\nThe primary focus of RapidApp is on DBIx::Class databases, with full CRUD capabilities, understanding of underlying column types, foreign keys and relationships, etc., but there is also built-in support for templating, CMS, authentication and permissions, saved views, reports and so on.\n\nRapidApp provides a high-level declarative syntax to create fully working apps in just a few lines of code but still provides full access to the Catalyst development stack for extension and customization (TIMTOWTDI).\n\nIn addition to covering the basics of the RapidApp APIs, several example demo applications will be shown, including creating a new app from scratch, **live**, during the presentation.\n\nAdditional existing applications with different use-cases will also be shown, each with full working source-code available on GitHub:\n\ngithub.com/vanstyn/BlueBox\ngithub.com/IntelliTree/RA-SmsArc\ngithub.com/IntelliTree/RA-ChinookDemo\ngithub.com/vanstyn/MimeCas\ngithub.com/IntelliTree/RA-InfoSite\n\n--------\n\nRapidApp was shown in a lightning talk last year: http://www.yapcna.org/yn2013/talk/4863\n\nMuch progress has been made since then including public release on GitHub/CPAN and launch of the project website with some video demos: www.rapidapp.info\n\nAbout Me: You can find a bio with picture, as well as a listing of some articles I've written for Linux Journal, covering topics such as Moose, Catalyst and Git, here: http://www.linuxjournal.com/users/henry-van-styn"
