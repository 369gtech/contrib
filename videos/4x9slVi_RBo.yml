description: "The talk from .NET Fest conference in Kyiv, Ukraine.\nPresentation: https://bit.ly/2SpaOs5\nFb: https://www.facebook.com/dotNETFest/\nWebsite: http://dotnetfest.com/\n\nIf you are convinced that actor model can drive your design of scalable and performant .NET applications, you will very likely give a chance to Akka.NET - a port of JVM Akka framework that gained popularity among .NET developers. And if you are fan of a functional programming, you will certainly try Akka.NET F# API. But which of them? There is an official one, but there is also an experimental one, called Akkling that offers typed actors and F# support for actor lifecycle, cluster sharding and reactive streams.\nCome to this talk and you will be convinced that Akkling is the way to go!"
