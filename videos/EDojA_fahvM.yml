description: "What if we could build on top of Datomic Ions already easy-to-use, easy-to-deploy, setup and make some common scenarios even simpler and faster to deploy? Welcome to a functional, cloud-based approach to Declarative Domain Modeling.\n\nDeclarative programming is a programming paradigm where problems are solved by expressing properties and structures of the desired solutions without describing how to achieve them.\n\nIn this talk I will walk through a Declarative Domain Modeling approach that empowers developers to focus on describing domain elements while leaving implementation considerations to be taken care by dedicated functional frameworks.\n\nClojure, in particular, suits this approach very well due to its data literals. Domain Specific Language (DSL) facilities, its dynamic nature, and powerful meta-programming capabilities.\n\nThe talk will explore the concepts supporting this approach while being backed by a reference implementation using with a meta-modeling infrastructure, a reference Datomic framework, a reference GraphQL framework, and a sample application running on Datomic Cloud/Ion and exposing a fully-functional GraphQL interface."
