description: "Technology at Spotify is filled to the brim with talented, driven and passionate engineers, who together work to solve the challenges we face to reach our north star goals. One of our core beliefs is Collaboration, and one obstacle to be great at collaborating with each other are the silos that we sometimes unknowingly and unwillingly put ourselves in, where we restrict ourselves by disciplines and even by syntax.\n\nIn this talk, you’ll hear what happens when you break those silos, as Raul and Elin walk through what they’ve experienced and learned in the process of collaborating closely between mobile and backend development.\n\nAbout Elin Nilsson\nElin is an Android developer at Spotify, working on platform and architecture, and master in cat gif communication.\n\nAbout Raul Herbster\nFor a decade, Raul has been working with tools and infrastructure, providing support for developers with different backgrounds, and in companies with different sizes, including startups and Spotify. Initially with focus on mobile and embedded software engineering, Raul added more to his repertoire: backend, data and more recently management. He is an advocate for multidisciplinary on software teams, and has changed recently from a mobile-driven tribe, to a backend-driven tribe at Spotify. Working on blending the culture is a challenging and rewarding experience that he is proud to talk about."
