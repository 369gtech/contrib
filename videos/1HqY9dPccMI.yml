description: "The Point of Views: Multidimensional Index Sets for Data Locality in HPC Applications\n\nhttp://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2017\n—\nIn High Performance Computing, data access has complex implications and requires concepts that are fundamentally different from those provided in the STL.\nIterators as we know them just are not enough.\nThe proposed range concepts for the standard library are a significant improvement but are designed for the mental model of iterating and mapping values, not hierarchical domain decomposition.\n\nEven for a seemingly trivial array there are countless ways to partition and store its elements in distributed memory, and algorithms are required to behave and scale identically for all of them. It also does not help that most applications operate on multidimensional data structures where efficient access to neighborhood regions is crucial. Among HPC developers, it is therefore widely accepted that canonical iteration space and physical memory layout must be specified as separate concepts. \n\nFor this, we use views based on multidimensional index sets, inspired by the proposed range concepts.\n\nIn this session, we will explain the challenges when distributing container elements for thousands of cores and how modern C++ allows to achieve portable efficiency.\nAs an HPC afficionado, you know you want this:\n\ncopy( matrix_a | local() | block({ 2,3 }), matrix_b | block({ 4,5 }) )\n\nIf this does not look familiar to you: we give a gentle introduction to High Performance Computing along the way.\n— \nTobias Fuchs: LMU Munich, Leibniz Supercomputing Centre, Research Associate\n\nTobi is a freelancer in embedded systems and real-time applications for over 10 years, mostly for medical devices, and went back to academia for PhD studies in High Performance Computing at LMU Munich.\nHe is the lead developer of the DASH C++ template library, a project of the German Research Foundation (DFG), and currently focuses on models and programming abstractions for data locality.\nAs a hobby, he lures unsuspecting students into his C++ programming course to entrap them in category theory.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
