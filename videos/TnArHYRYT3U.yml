description: "by Christian Brauner\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/UA2.114/containers_kernel_update.webm\n\n\nIn this talk we will focus on container related kernel features. We will take\nan in-depth, technical look at what features have been worked on, are currently\nworked, or are planned. Containers have become ubiquitous. Nowadays, the computing landscape is mostly\nconcerned with a higher-level view on the functionality and features of\ncontainers (e.g. orchestration). In this talk we will take a step back and\nfocus on the low-level aspects that make containers possible. Specifically, we\nwill look at kernel features that have been implemented in the last year(s),\nfeatures that are currently being worked on and features that are planned in\nthe future. We will try to take a closer technical look and not shy away from\nanalysing code and patchsets where needed. The goal of the talk is to inform\nusers about the kernel development status but also to raise awareness that all\nthe shiny glitter takes a lot of difficult technical arguments and patches that\nare not just \"boring plumbing\" but actually are pretty exciting. \n\nRoom: UA2.114 (Baudoux)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 11:40:00+01"
