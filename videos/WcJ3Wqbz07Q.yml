Robotic Process Automation is Automation of repetitive and rule based tasks. In Edureka's RPA online training, you will learn about the RPA concepts and will gain in-depth knowledge on UiPath tool using which you can automate the data extraction from the internet, login process, image recognition process and many more.\n\nAfter completing the RPA Training, you will be able to:\n\n1. Know about Robotic Process Automations and how it works\n2. Know about the patterns and key considerations while designing a RPA solution\n3. Know about the leading RPA tool i.e. UiPath\n4. Gain practical knowledge on designing RPA solutions using both the tools\n5. Perform Image and Text automation\n6. Create RPA bots and perform data manipulation\n7. Debug and handle the exceptions through the tool\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - \nWhy learn Robotic Process Automation?\n\nRobotic Process Automation (RPA) is an automation technology for making smart software by applying intelligence to do high volume and repeatable tasks that are time-consuming. RPA is automating the tasks of wide variety of industries, hence reducing the time and increasing the output. Some of facts about RPA includes:\n\n1. A 2016 report by McKinsey and Co. predicts that the robotic process automation market could be worth $6.7 trillion by 2025\n\n2. A major global wine business, after implementing RPA, increased the order accuracy from 98% to 99.7% while costs reduced to Rs. 5.2 Crore\n\n3. A global dairy company used RPA to automate the processing and validation of delivery claims, reduced goodwill write-offs by Rs. 464 Million\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - -\nFor more information, please write back to us at sales@edureka.co or call us at IND: 9606058406 / US: 18338555775 (toll-free)."
