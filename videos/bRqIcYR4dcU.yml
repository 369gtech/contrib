description: "This talk is another reminder that tests are code too and need care and feeding. It describes an experimental spike that we ran on a complex Go project to make the integration tests faster and more readable. We showed how not to rely too heavily on the testing framework and to refactor test code to represent the domain better. We also showed that teams have to move at their own pace, and that teams have to take into account the “House Style” of coding.\n\nCo-authored with Winna Bridgewater, software engineer at Pivotal.\n\n// This talk was given by Steve Freeman at SC London 2017, a conference dedicated to Craftsmanship values, XP practices & clean code.
