description: 'Vert.x is a toolkit for building reactive applications on the JVM. It''s event driven, non blocking and polyglot, which makes it an excellent platform for building microservices. In this talk, I''ll share experiences and from a Dutch company that started building reactive web applications with Vert.x about 3 years ago. You''ll learn the concepts behind Vert.x, why we chose Vert.x, how we''re using it and the challenges we faced.
