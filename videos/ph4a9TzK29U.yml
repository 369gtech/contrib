description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nGrowth and Design Patterns in the Extensions Ecosystem - Eric Tune, Google \n\nHow big is the Kubernetes Extensions ecosystem today and how quickly has it grown? How many CNCF projects does it touch?  Data gathered from Github over 2 years by the speaker provides detailed answers.    Based on experience as a Kubernetes contributor and API reviewer, and from analyzing hundreds of extensions, the speaker has identified recurring Design Patterns, like: Provisioner, Composition, Enforcer, Claim, and Class.  End users will learn to recognize the patterns, and API authors will learn when to apply them.   The talk will be accessible to a general audience. However, experts on Kubernetes Extensions will still find ideas and data not presented anywhere before. Illustrative examples will be used from various CNCF projects, such as Vitess, Jaeger, OpenEBS, and Rook.   \n\nhttps://sched.co/UaYw"
