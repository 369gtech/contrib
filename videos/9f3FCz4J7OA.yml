title: 'Big data analytics using a custom SQL engine (Andrii Tsvelodub, Ukraine) [RU]'

description: "Although the beginnings of SQL date back to 70s, the language is more relevant than ever. You can save your data in good old PostgreSQL, a fancy new NoSQL database, or even some in-house built storage, but everyone will want to use SQL to query it.\n\nAt Zoomdata we build a modern BI platform, which works natively with regular DBs and big data alike. We went through several implementations, employing different approaches and frameworks, but in the end, concluded that the best way to execute analytical queries is to use an engine that natively understands SQL and relational algebra.\n\nIn this talk I will introduce Apache Calcite â€“ an open source framework that can help you build your own database, execute queries over distributed data sources, and much more. I will also share our experience of using it and will demo an example of how to build your own SQL front-end to any data you have (and it will be better than Mongo)."
