title: 'My Observable Will Go On! | Jan-Niklas Wortmann | ng-conf 2021'
language: English
recordingDate: 1635182101
description: "Near, far, wherever you are\nI believe that my Observable does go on\n\nWhy does using RxJS sometimes feel like navigating a ship through a sea of icebergs? The chance of hitting an iceberg with a ship is maybe low, but using Observables without fully understanding their underlying lifecycle makes the chance of hitting icebergs in your code very high. RxJS, like a powerful, luxurious steam ship, can be intimidating and even dangerous when you do not fully know what you are doing.\nLet me guide you through avoiding those icebergs by teaching you the lifecycle of an Observable. Do you know why `catchError` should be placed on an inner Observable? Do you know why `takeUntil` should usually be placed as the last operator, but sometimes not in edge cases? This talk will make you understand those concepts to help you see through the RxJS fog along your coding cruise and avoid hitting any icebergs that may appear.\n\nng-conf is a multi-day Angular conference focused on delivering the highest quality training in the Angular JavaScript framework. 1000's of developers from across the globe join together to attend talks and workshops by the Angular team and other community experts.\n\nFollow us on twitter https://twitter.com/ngconfâ€‹ \nOfficial Website: https://www.ng-conf.org/"
