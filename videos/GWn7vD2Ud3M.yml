recordingDate: 1469999533
description: "This video is all about autoencoders! I start off explaining what an autoencoder is and how it works. Then I talk about some use cases for autoencoders and the special types of autoencoders we use for each of them. Finally, I programmatically go through an example of a simple autoencoder, followed by a demo. \n\nThe code for this video is here:\n\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/autoencoder_demo/tree/master\n\nI created a Slack channel for us, sign up here:\nhttps://wizards.herokuapp.com/\n\nAutoencoder live demo in the browser:\n\nhttps://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/demo/autoencoder.html\n\nand here are some great links to read up on autoencoders:\n\nhttp://ufldl.stanford.edu/tutorial/unsupervised/Autoencoders/\n\nhttp://lazyprogrammer.me/a-tutorial-on-autoencoders/\n\nhttps://blog.keras.io/building-autoencoders-in-keras.html\n\nhttps://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-resources-for-learning-about-autoencoders-from-scratch\n\nI love you guys! Thanks for watching my videos, I do it for you. I left my awesome job at Twilio and I'm doing this full time now. \n\nI recently created a Patreon page.
