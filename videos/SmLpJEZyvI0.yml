description: "Presented by Ari Hershowitz, Director of Open Government, Xcential Corporation\n\n\"Many people talk of 'git for law'. It's neither as simple as coders imagine, nor as complex as lawyers would make it. A new rule in the U.S. House of Representatives (the 'Posey Rule'), requires redlined prints comparing documents before and after changes in Committee.\n\nAs a lawyer who codes, I work for the U.S. House of Representatives to build document comparison software that works for law, can track changes in law and ultimately will be able to show what the law was at any point in time.\"\n\nAbout GitMerge\nGit Merge is the pre-eminent Git-focused conference: a full-day offering technical content and user case studies, plus a day of workshops for Git users of all levels. Git Merge is dedicated to amplifying new voices in the Git community and to showcasing the most thought-provoking projects from contributors, maintainers and community managers around the world.
