description: "Keynote: User Panel - Matti Maier, c-Com GmbH; Jay Piskorik, DICK'S Sporting Goods; Jai Schniepp, Liberty Mutual and Moderated by Frederic Lardinois, TechCrunch\n\nAbout Jai Schniepp\nJai is the Director of Product for Secure DevOps Platforms at Liberty Mutual. Armed with a BS in Marketing and an MBA, she’s got the coveted soft skills her Information Technology peers long for—she’s outspoken, expressive and action-oriented. Her entire career is based on managing and building technical products from a non-technical perspective. She’s a product maven and an agile pro who's spent over a decade partnering with like-minded practitioners to introduce CI/CD practices, cloud native solutions, and deliver products that drive developers further up the value line. Customer point of view and the developer experience are her everything--yet she still wants to be an astronaut.\n\nAbout Frederic Lardinois\nBefore he joined TechCrunch in 2012, he founded SiliconFilter and wrote for ReadWriteWeb (now ReadWrite). Frederic covers enterprise, cloud, developer tools, Google, Microsoft, gadgets, transportation and anything else he finds interesting. He owns just over a 50th of a bitcoin.\n\nAbout Matti Maier\nI grew up in a small village in south Germany. Even as a teen I was into computers writing programs for my family’s business. After completing a year of high-school in Vancouver, BC and graduating in Germany, I studied business information systems in Munich where I graduated with a Master’s degree. Afterwards, I worked as a consultant and project manager in the SAP ecosystem. In 2014 I was asked to build and head the software development department of what nowadays is AutoProp, a company providing real estate and land development analytics in Canada to more than 10,000 customers. Since 2016 I’m heading the software development of a digitization platform in the metal cutting tools industry. Besides I’m an enthusiastic upright and electric bass player using my experience with technology and music as the founder of the BNote open source project.\n\nAbout Jay Piskorik\nJay Piskorik serves as the Director of Platform Engineering at DICK’S Sporting Goods where he plays an integral role in developing the Company’s cloud strategy and digital transformation.
