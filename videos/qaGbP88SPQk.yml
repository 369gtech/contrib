description: "This video was recorded at Code Mesh LDN 18 http://bit.ly/2P7SPII\n\nGet involved in Code Sync's next conference http://bit.ly/2Mcm4aS\n\n---\n\nINTRODUCTION TO AI ENGINEERING\nby Garrett Smith\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nAI\nSoftware\nDevelopment \n\n\nTALK LEVEL: Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced\n\nABSTRACT\nThe field of AI engineering has emerged over the last several years, fueled by breakthroughs in applied machine learning, computational acceleration, and supporting software frameworks. While similar to traditional software development disciplines, AI engineering requires additional roles, skill sets, and techniques that make it challenging to implement successfully in organizations unfamiliar with AI. \n\nIn this talk, Garrett Smith, founder of Guild AI, will discuss the process of creating AI applications and the roles involved, with an emphasis on software engineering. Garrett will highlight the key differences between AI application development\_and traditional programming. If you or your organisation is interested in building AI competency, this talk will give you an outline for understanding and approaching the various problems you will face.\n\nRead the full abstract: http://codesync.global/speaker/garrett-smith/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - GARRETT SMITH\nFounder Guild AI, deep learning engineer and teacher\n\nGarrett Smith is the founder of Guild AI, an open source package management and automation tool for machine learning models.
