SIG Docs chairs and tech leads cover how to add and update docs for Kubernetes features, docs in the release cycle, how to localize your content, and where to get help when you need it. We'll walk through the website repo's branching strategy and content architecture, and explore some of the tools to help folks write better docs. We'll also cover how and when to add third-party content for components like CNI plugins. We'll also spend plenty of time answering any questions you have. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ekHA"
