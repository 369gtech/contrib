recordingDate: 1436379639
description: "Robert Mircea: Developer since forever, Robert is currently managing a polyglot software engineering team working on improving Orange Romania’s online web and mobile platforms (Contul Meu, ecommerce store, Orange Single Sign-On, TV web portal, Orange APIs and others) which power www.orange.ro.\n\nThis real-world diversity exposed him to challenges in developing scalable and distributed web software for Romania’s largest telecom operator. He took many years ago the voluntary endeavour to scout, select and coach his fellows on modern web architectures and apply them in the right context. He still codes in C# for his company projects, is present on github and he can speak for hours about REST APIs design, distributed architectures, software development practices and automations. He acts as a fervent supporter for agile transformation and open source in a corporate world.\n\nThe talk: In the very competitive and demanding telecom market in Romania with lots of offers and a complex ecosystem of internal applications and platforms with spider style systems integrations, agility is a key element in delivery of new features and value for the business. IT in Orange Romania was always preoccupied on improving development and operational agility in order to deliver faster, with better quality and more predictability. At some point ago, we’ve embarked into the journey of continuous delivery adopting patterns and practices recommended by devops community.\n\nCheck out more about I T.A.K.E.
