description: "Connecting Kubernetes Clusters Across Cloud Providers - Thomas Graf, Covalent \n\nIt is well understood how to run individual Kubernetes clusters in all major clouds, managed and self-managed, but how do we connect individual clusters together? This talk will guide you how to interconnect multiple Kubernetes clusters running in different cloud providers. We will discuss how to establish basic pod to pod connectivity across clusters, add load balancing using standard Kubernetes services and finally add label based network policy to secure the communication both inside the cluster and across clusters. As a bonus, we will add Istio on top to establish mutual TLS across clusters for added security. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/GrWc"
