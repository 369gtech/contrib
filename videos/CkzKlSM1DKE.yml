description: "This is a presentation by Robert Fletcher at GR8 US 2012 (http://gr8conf.us). Slides can be viewed at https://github.com/sjurgemeyer/GR8-US-2012/tree/master/Betamax.\n\nBetamax is a tool for stubbing out HTTP dependencies in your tests. I'll show how you can use Betamax to record HTTP traffic between your app and external systems like webservices or REST servers then play it back later so that your tests don't fail because of unreliable 3rd party services. You can use Betamax to return custom HTTP responses so you can simulate all kinds of scenarios and error conditions."
