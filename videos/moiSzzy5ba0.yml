description: "Spring I/O Bridge (online conference) - 15 May 2020\n\nGitHub repo: https://github.com/kiegroup/optaplanner/tree/7.38.0.Final/optaplanner-quickstarts/spring-boot-school-timetabling\n\nForget about Machine Learning. Planning optimization is the most profitable AI technology on this planet.\n\nThe world is full of planning challenges, such as vehicle routing problems, maintenance scheduling and employee rostering. Find the quickest routes to visit n locations with k vehicles. Assign n shifts to k employees, taking into account skills and availability. Few people realize how much AI algorithms improve those solutions. For example, when a big telco started using OptaPlanner to plan their fleet of tens of thousands of technicians, they expected a driving time reduction of 1-2%. It was 25%. That saves them hundreds of millions of dollars and millions of kilograms of CO² emissions, every year.\n\nIn this session I’ll show you how to code a highschool timetabling application from scratch, with Spring Boot and OptaPlanner. It ‘ll generate the perfect lesson schedule, for both students and teachers."
