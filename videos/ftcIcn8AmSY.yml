description: "Google Tech Talk, 12/1/2015, Presented by Guy L. Steele Jr.\nABSTRACT:  We present a small but interesting geometrical problem and then examine four different computational approaches to solving it: a \"classic sequential solution\" and three different approaches that are amenable to parallel implementation, comparing them to highlight various advantages and disadvantages, including total work required and minimum time to solution.  All four solutions are illustrated both pictorially and with working code.  We argue that certain approaches work better than others if exploitation of parallelism is to be automated.  There will also be at least one joke.\n\nAbout the Speaker\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_L._Steele,_Jr."
