description: "Information hiding, coupling, and cohesion, microservices-style\n\nThe terms coupling and cohesion come from the world of structured programming, but they are also thrown about in the context of microservices. In this session, I look at the applicability of these terms to microservice architecture, and also do a deep dive into the different types of coupling to explore how ideas from the 1970s still have a lot of relevance to the types of systems we build today.\n\nI cover a number of topics in the context of microservices, including:\n\nKey topics:\n- What is the importance of information hiding, and how do you apply it\n- The interplay of coupling and cohesion\n- Different types of coupling, what kinds of problems they can cause, and how you can avoid them\n- How a surprising amount of good ideas came out of the 1960s and 1970s, but we just forgot them"
