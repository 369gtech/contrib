More experienced teams can optimize for these properties simultaneously. Now add an additional property: feature velocity. Organizations often try to optimize for feature velocity through process improvements and engineering hierarchy, but some optimize for feature velocity through explicit architectural decisions. These decisions increase the complexity of the system. This sounds like a trade-off: you get feature velocity, but for the price of increased complexity.\nMental models of architecture can help us understand the tension between these engineering properties. For example, understanding the distinction between accidental complexity and essential complexity can help you decide whether to invest engineering effort into simplifying your stack or expanding the surface area of functional output. Spoiler alert: most businesses prioritize feature [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n00:32 What is continuous verification?\n05:15 Myths of availability\n11:29 Dynamic safety model\n14:41 Economic pillars of complexity\n18:49 Merton quote\n19:53 Software engineering = the bureaucratic profession\n21:46 Outro\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotopia.eu/february-2021/sessions/1707/looking-back-to-look-forward-deprecating-simplicity-building-a-new-test-culture\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#ChaosEngineering #ContinuousVerification #Verification #CICD #Complexity #Simplicity #Resilience #BuildingResilience #Resiliency #Programming #SRE #Programming #GameDay #DigitalTransformation\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
