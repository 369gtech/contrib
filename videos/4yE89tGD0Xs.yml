description: "We hear from Frances Buontempo at SC London 2019. She gives some great advice for anyone starting out in their Software Craftsmanship journey. Hint: it's not great to sit alone behind your computer screen. Get out there and meet people! During her talk, Frances discusses Machine Learning and AI; how these terms have been misappropriated over the past few years, what these terms actually mean, and where the future of machine learning and AI can take us.  It's all about feedback and people. \n\nFor more information on SC London or to find out how you can participate, please visit https://sc-london.com/.\n\nRelated Content:\nWhat's Machine Learning Got to Do with It? https://youtu.be/OPodnRI42E8"
