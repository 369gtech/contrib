language: English
recordingDate: 1628100085
description: "In this Session, we share how you can build an intelligent User Interface (UI) at any scale by combining Angular and TensorFlow.js. First we explore how you can start with machine learning declaratively in your Angular templates in just a few minutes. Then you learn how to build an ML model with data from Google Analytics to better predict a user’s browsing patterns. Finally, we show a powerful TensorFlow Extended (TFX) based training pipeline to automate the training and deployment process.\n\nResources:\nPredictive prefetching demo → https://goo.gle/3fIgUAj\nOptimize your website with machine learning → https://goo.gle/3u5nyGz\nTensorFlow Extended (TFX) → https://goo.gle/3gLqu7n\n\nSpeakers: Minko Gechev, David Zats\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).
