recordingDate: 1528210034
description: "Big data is the new big thing where storing the data is the easy part. Gaining insights in your pile of data is something different.\n\nBased on a data dump of the well-known StackExchange websites, we will store & analyse 150+ GB of data with Azure Data Lake Store & Analytics to gain some insights about their users. After that we will use Power BI to give an at a glance overview of our learnings.\nIf you are a developer that is interested in big data, this is your time to shine! We will use our existing SQL & C# skills to analyse everything without having to worry about running clusters."
