title: 'Keynote: Using EEG and Machine Learning to Perform Lie Detection - Jennifer Marsman'
language: English
recordingDate: 1506326612
description: "Using an EPOC headset from Emotiv, I have captured 14 channels of EEG (brain waves) while subjects lied and answered truthfully to a series of questions.\n\nI fed this labelled dataset into Azure Machine Learning to build a classifier which predicts whether a subject is telling the truth or lying. In this session, I will share my results on this “lie detector” experiment. I will show my machine learning model, data cleaning process, and results, along with discussing the limitations of my approach and next steps/resources. Attendees will gain exposure to the Emotiv EPOC headset and Azure Machine Learning."
