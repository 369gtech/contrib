description: "by Guillaume Tucker\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/K.4.401/kernelci_a_new_dawn.webm\n\n\nKernelCI is a project dedicated to testing the upstream Linux kernel.  Originally created by Linaro in 2014, it is now given a second breath by joining the Linux Foundation and has a fast growing community.  Results are already starting to show. On testing the upstream kernel\n\nThe upstream Linux kernel is known for having a high rate of\nchanges while supporting a vast range of hardware.  How is it being\ntested?  The answer is manifold, with various systems focusing on\nvery different use-cases.  From Intel's 0-Day project which has a\nlarge test coverage but only runs on x86 platforms to individual\nhackers who only have their locally available development hardware,\nthere is no comprehensive solution to test the kernel as a whole. \n\nA second breath for KernelCI\n\nKernelCI was originally created by Linaro in 2014 to address a\nsegmented ARM ecosystem.  It then went through a long period of\nslow progress, with a good range of hardware in its test labs but\nlimited build infrastructure, a reduced community and a lack of\nadvanced features.  It is now given a second breath: labs are\ngrowing with new devices, functional testing is expanding to cover\nmore subsystems, automated bisection is becoming effective.  Last\nbut not least, KernelCI is now joining the Linux Foundation with a\nmembership scheme to provide it with a sustainable structure and\nfunding. \n\nIn the long run\n\nOverall, the project aims at testing the upstream kernel in its\nentirety.  The hope is to gradually shift the kernel development\nmodel to become more test-driven with continuous automated testing.\nIt is a very big task, so to start with it's going off the beaten\ntracks by looking at areas that are not already very well covered.\nAnd of course, there are many things there that need fixing before\nthey become real problems for users. \n\nRoom: K.4.401\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 16:00:00+01"
