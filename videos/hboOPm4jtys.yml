description: "Get the Code & Diagrams: http://goo.gl/fG0H4\n\nI showed you how to turn your program idea into a Use Case. Then we turned the Use Case into a Domain Model. Then I showed you how to turn the Use Case into a Sequence Diagram. Then we made the Sequence Diagram into a Class Diagram. Now I'm going to show you how to convert the Sequence Diagram into working code.\n\nI make part of the code in this video. The rest will be made in part 9 of my Object Oriented Design Tutorial. \n\nAll of the code and diagrams are available in the link above."
