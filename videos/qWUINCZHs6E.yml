description: "Ближайшая конференция — DotNext 2020 Moscow\n2-5 декабря, Online\nПодробности и билеты: https://dotnext-moscow.ru/\n\n. Лидер рейтингов DotNext и актуальная тема построения инфраструктуры для микросервисов.\n\nMany organizations are now building microservices-based systems. But with the adoption of this architecture style, the need arises for a good way to control and monitor all the services and their traffic. To handle this, you can leverage what is called a service mesh.\n\nIn this session Edwin will introduce you to what a service mesh is and show you how to implement one for your microservices-based system. He'll show you how to implement intelligent routing, resilience (circuit-breakers), A/B testing, monitoring and security. For the implementation Edwin uses Istio — an open source service mesh solution."
