Approved Trainer in Agile PM, PRINCE2, MSP and P3O. Certified Project & Programme Manager. Co-author of Polish version of PRINCE2 and P3O core publications. Leads many meetings on project management across Europe.\n\nTo agile or not to agile? That is a question for traditional project managers\n\nThere are huge expectations from Agile approaches. Agile is expected to resolve all the problems we face when using traditional project methods. What is more, it is described as a very easy to use, almost without any effort to embed it in an organization. We simply reject the traditional \"waterfall\" approach to project management and introduce Agile. Some people promise that you donâ€™t need anything more if you start using Agile. The speaker will highlight all myths and facts about Agile and guide the audience through organizational governance of business change with the portfolio, programme, team and delivery management. Agile is a part of organization governance and there is a room for both Agile and traditional project management. There is no conflict between traditional and Agile approaches - they do support each other! The principles of AgilePM will be shortly presented together with good and bad examples of applying Agile to the projects."
