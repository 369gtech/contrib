description: "Talk recording from AmsterdamJS August 2018 Meetup\nhttps://www.meetup.com/AmsterdamJS/events/252195725/\n\nAnimation is back in the web development tool chest! We know of declarative CSS Animations and Transitions and fully featured JavaScript animation libraries like GreenSock, but there's another option: the Web Animation API! In this talk Rachel Nabors will take you on a magical journey with Alice from Wonderland to show you how this new API is used to run the CSS Animations in your browser and how you can use it to generate and manipulate animations in your project. Colorful, interactive, useful fun for all disciplines.\n\nAbout Rachel\nRachel Nabors (http://rachelnabors.com) began telling stories online as a teenager with her award-winning web comics (http://rachelthegreat.com). Her love of web technologies transformed into a career in front end development, where she has worked with Mozilla, the W3C, and Microsoft to build the web forward."
