description: "Speaker: Peter Wilson\n\nAlmost everyone will have heard the phrase “don’t hack WordPress core” before, what’s less known is that it’s only the start of the saying. Don’t hack WordPress core, without contributing the hacks back.\n\nContributing to WordPress core is like riding a bike, it takes a little effort to get started but once you learn it’s a skill you’ll never forget.\n\nYou will be given a jump start on contributing, from how to use the bug tracker all the way to contributing a patch and getting your first props.\n\nAbout the speaker:\n\nPeter Wilson is a web-developer with twenty years experience, a CSS junkie, a WordPress Engineer at Human Made and a guest committer to WordPress core.\n\nHe has worked in both client services and on enterprise applications.\n\nHis portfolio includes working on sites for some of Australia’s largest listed companies and highest profile performers.\n\nPeter writes at peterwilson.cc.\n\nEvent Page: https://2016.singapore.wordcamp.org/\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/VfFg/"
