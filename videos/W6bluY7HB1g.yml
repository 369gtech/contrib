description: "Customize Your Cloud Foundry UI through Stratos Extension Framework - Troy Topnik, SUSE & Bo Yang, IBM\n\nStratos UI is an open-source, modern, web-based management UI aimed at meeting the needs of both Developers and Administrators. It has been adopted by a number of commercial Clouds as the default UI for managing Cloud Foundry resources. Given there are different extended capabilities that cloud providers want to have in their Cloud Foundry platform, there is a need for extending the UI besides the core Cloud Foundry management features.\n\nIn this talk, the Stratos and AutoScaler project leads will present a joint work of Stratos UI extension framework, and how AutoScaler is leveraging this extension framework to seamlessly enable users to manage autoscaling policies, view and query application metrics and scaling events in Stratos application dashboard with consistent use experience. The presenters will also showcase how the integrated UI looks like in IBM Cloud Foundry Enterprise Environments.\n\nAbout Troy Topnik\nTroy is a Senior Product Manager responsible for SUSE Cloud Application Platform. He began working with Cloud Foundry shortly after its open source debut in 2011, and has been a technical writer, instructor, and product manager with the ActiveState and HPE Helion Stackato teams.\n\nAbout Bo Yang\nBo Yang is a senior technical staff member of IBM Watson and Cloud. He is currently working on the development of cloud application tools and services for IBM Cloud. Previously he was a senior research scientist in IBM research in the areas of distributed system and big data. Bo has published 20+ academic papers and holds more than 40 patents. He has delivered quite a few presentations and invited talks in both academic and industry events in the past ten years.\n\nhttps://www.cloudfoundry.org/"
