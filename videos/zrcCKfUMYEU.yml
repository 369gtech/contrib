title: 'YOW! Data 2017 J. Rosenbaum - The Future of Art'
recordingDate: 1507856403
description: "Most people are aware of the impact machine learning will have on jobs, on the future of research and autonomous machines, but few seem to be aware of the future role machine learning could play in the creative arts, in visual art and music. What will art be like when artists and musicians routinely work collaboratively with machines to create new and interesting artworks? What can we learn from art created using neural networks and what can we create? From the frivolous to the beautiful what does art created by computers look like and where can it take us?\n\nThis talk will explore magenta in tensorflow and neural style in caffe, google deep dream, next Rembrandt, and convolutional neural networks. I will look into some of the beautiful applications of machine learning in art and some of the ridiculous ones as well.\n\nI am an artist working with 3D modelling, Augmented Reality and Machine Learning. My work explores posthuman and postgender concepts using classical art combined with new media techniques and programming.\n\nJ has recently undertaken a masters degree and changed focus to more technologically based digital art using physics based rendering, Deep Neural Networks and Unity to develop an Augmented Reality mobile application.\n\nFor more on YOW!
