recordingDate: 1622448900
description: "Microservices made easy with an Open Standards based Stack\nSpeaker: Jamie Coleman, IBM\n\nAbstract Microservices, microservices, microservices! That is all I hear from developers but how many of them have taken the plunge and started developing in this architecture style? When you start planning a microservice project there are many more things that need to be considered that simply was not required when creating monoliths. This talk will talk you through a truly open source, cloud-native stack starting at the bottom with OpenShift, then onto the JVM with OpenJ9,Open Liberty as the cloud-native application server then finally Jakarta EE and MicroProfile as the Enterprise Java specs for microservices.\n\nRecorded Tuesday 9 March 2021 kl. 12:00"
