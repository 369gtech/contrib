description: "Full title: Are you using an opensource library? There's a good chance you are vulnerable..\n\nDo you remember Equifax? How did someone manage to steal the data of almost 200 million users? Well, Equifax simply fell victim to a vulnerability on a framework, Struts, which older developers like me remember well. But you folks, who now use cooler things like Guava or Jackson, do you feel safe? Unfortunately, you are not. After a clear introduction to the problem, with a couple of other illustrious examples, we will perform a couple of exploits together, live, and then take a look at possible prevention strategies. This talk will open your eyes to a problem you did not know you had."
