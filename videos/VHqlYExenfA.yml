description: "Presenters:  Josh Long, Pivotal and John Davies, C24\n\nWhile some of today's systems can hit ?Sec performance it usually take a lot of good design and optimization. The solution is often hard-baked and inflexible and the end user still wants the flexibility promised by ESBs with dynamic routing based on runtime rules with transformations from one format to another. Josh and John will walk you through the latest in high performance message handling with Spring Integration covering non-XML (binary and CSV) data, code generation, on-the-fly compilation, dynamic routing and in-memory queries - an hour well spent.\n\nlearn more about Spring Integration at: http://projects.spring.io/spring-integration"
