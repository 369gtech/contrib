description: "Do you love the simplicity and ease of pushing your application to Cloud Foundry but want to know what happens to your app instances under the hood? Do you operate a Cloud Foundry deployment and need to understand how all its different components work together to keep applications running?\n\nAfter years of development, Diego has now replaced the previous DEA system as the official container runtime at the heart of Cloud Foundry, capable of running even the largest CF deployments. In this talk, the project lead for the Diego team will survey how the Diego components interact with each other and with the other subsystems inside of CF to run application instances, how those interactions have changed over the past year to improve system stability, security, and scale, and how to use tooling such as the CF Diego Operator Toolkit (\"cfdot\") to inspect the app instances and tasks in a deployment. This talk will also review how Diego enables powerful platform features such as container networking and volume plugins, and discuss other upcoming features that CF teams are actively working on and exploring today.\n\nAfter attending this talk, you'll be ready to operate your Diego-backed CF deployment with confidence and to take advantage of the powerful features it unlocks for your applications.\n\nEric Malm\nPivotal Software\nEric works at Pivotal Software as the Product Manager for the CF Runtime Diego team, and prior to that was a software engineer on the Diego team and on the CF Runtime team. He also holds a Ph.D. in Mathematics from Stanford University."
