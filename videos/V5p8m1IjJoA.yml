description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2012\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nJoshua Kerievsky - Founder, Industrial Logic and Author of \"Refactoring to Patterns\"\n\nABSTRACT\nLean Startup is a disciplined, scientific and capital efficient method for discovering and building products and services that people love. Pioneered by entrepreneur and engineer, Eric Ries, the Lean Startup method will thoroughly change how you think about and practice agility. Born from the struggles and ultimate triumphs of successful software companies, Lean Startups use rigorous experimentation, careful measurement, validated learning and pivot/persevere decisions to systematically produce happy customers and successful businesses. In this talk, you'll learn why this decade will be dominated by the Lean Startup method and what you can do to make it a part of your process.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
