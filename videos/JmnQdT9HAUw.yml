description: 'An introduction to building Alexa "skills". I will walk through the architecture and concepts behind Alexa programming, giving some practical advice as to what works and what doesn''t work. I will show how to link Alexa to sentiment analysis, and take a look at the sentiment analysis APIs available at the moment. After attending this talk, you''ll be equipped to build your own Alexa skills, and also aware of what is and isn''t a good concept to build.'
