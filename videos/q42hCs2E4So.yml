description: "Speaker: Renato Oliveira\n\nWhen we talk about Web API Design, we're usually driven to think in architecture, verbs, and nouns. But we often forget our user: the developer.\n\nUX designers rely on many techniques to create great experiences. User research, User Testing, Personas, Usage Data Analysis and others. However when creating `invisible products` we’re not used to think in usability. So why don’t we take advantage of this background to improve our APIs experiences?\n\n\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2018 and https://github.com/PyCon/2018-slides"
