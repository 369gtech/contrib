description: "Flink Forward Berlin, September 2017 #flinkforward\n\nTimo Walther, Software Engineer at data Artisans\n\nFlink’s DataStream abstraction is a powerful API which lets you flexibly define both basic and complex streaming pipelines. However, many users need an API which quickly solves 80% of their use cases where simple tasks can be defined using little code. Therefore the community has made effort to add relational APIs to Apache Flink, a standard SQL API and a language-integrated Table API. A large amount of contributors push the development quickly. In this talk, we show the current status of the APIs in a live demo. Among others, we demonstrate the support of retractions in Dynamic Tables and different kinds of aggregations such as SQL OVER windows, GROUP BY windows, and non-windowed aggregates.\n\nhttps://www.slideshare.net/FlinkForward/flink-forward-berlin-2017-timo-wahlter-from-streams-to-tables-and-back-again-a-demo-of-flinks-table-sql-api\n\nhttps://data-artisans.com/"
