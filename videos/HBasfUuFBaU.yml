description: "Uncovering Access, Reuse, and Sharing Characteristics of I/O-Intensive Files on Large Scale Production HPC Systems\n\nTirthak Patel, Northeastern University; Suren Byna, Glenn K. Lockwood, and Nicholas J. Wright, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Philip Carns and Robert Ross, Argonne National Laboratory; Devesh Tiwari, Northeastern University\n\nLarge-scale high-performance computing (HPC) applications running on supercomputers produce large amounts of data routinely and store it in files on multi-PB shared parallel storage systems. Unfortunately, storage community has a limited understanding of the access and reuse patterns of these files. This paper investigates the access and reuse patterns of I/O- intensive files on a production-scale supercomputer.\n\nView the full FAST '20 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/fast20/technical-sessions"
