description: "We're living in a more and more connected world. In the past, relational databases help us to \"define\" relationships between entities, nowadays graph databases help us to \"find\" and \"discover\" relationships between connected entities we don't even know they exist.\n\nThe first half of the talk will present the theory behind property graph, topology of graph and graph traversal.\n\nThe second half will focus on more concrete examples. From a sample dataset, we'll try to find relations between our data using the Gremlin graph query language. For each example, we'll compare the classical relational database approach, the graph database approach as well as functional programming approach."
