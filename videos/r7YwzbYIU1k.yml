title: 'Microservices and Docker at Scale: the PB&J of Modern Application Delivery - Electric Cloud'
recordingDate: 1479330005
description: "Microservices and Docker at Scale: the PB&J of Modern Application Delivery\n\nAnders Wallgren, CTO, Electric Cloud\n\nDocker has matured, and is expanding from being predominantly used in the Build/Test stages to Production deployments. Similarly, microservices are expanding from being used mostly for green-field web services to being used in the enterprise - as organizations explore ways to decompose their monolith to support faster release cycles.\n\nRunning microservices-based applications in a containerized environment makes a lot of sense – both for Build and Test, as well as from a runtime perspective in Production.\n\nDocker and Microservices are natural companions, forming the foundation for modern application delivery. However, managing microservices and large-scale Docker deployments pose unique challenges for enterprise IT.\n\nThis talk discusses the modern requirements for building, deploying and operating microservices on a large-scale Docker-ized infrastructure. It covers:\n\n• Patterns for microservices-based architectures\n• What makes Docker such a good fit for microservices\n• How to operationalize Docker orchestration, auto-scaling and DR in large-scale Production environments – recommended typologies and patterns\n• Best practices for Docker configuration and registry management to ensure consistency throughout the pipeline and stability in Production\n• Tips for integrating containers into complex existing environments, supporting the hybrid state of microservices and monolithic applications\n• Tips and tooling for monitoring and managing clusters of containers as a single distributed application\n• Putting an end to Shadow-IT: how can IT enable Dev and Ops to use Docker for both microservices and traditional application releases - while ensuring visibility, security, governance and compliance\n\nDOES16 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
