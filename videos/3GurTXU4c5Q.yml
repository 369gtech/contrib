description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2013\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nDrew McCormack - Judge, Jury & Executioner at The Mental Faculty B.V\n\nABSTRACT\nThis is the age of ubiquitous data. Your stuff is with you wherever you are, and accessible via whatever you happen to be holding in your hand. In some cases, such as with email, this is even mostly true. But for many apps, trustworthy syncing of data remains elusive. As every developer will happily tell you — it's a hard problem. \n\nIn this presentation, I'll take you on my own journey through the Land of Sync, with a strong focus on Core Data and syncing of relatively large quantities of media. We'll begin with iCloud, talk about where it all went wrong, look at the various modern approaches to syncing distributed database stores, and end — hopefully —arriving at a sane solution.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
