description: "In this highly engaging session, Bill will detail how today’s disruptive heroes — you! — can create a future that amazing for all of us! He will focus on how new emerging technologies impact people, their behaviors, and their needs. Super-empowering technologies require far more empowerment from leaders and, for some, far more help in going through personal change and transformation. This session is about leading people through change and transformation while doing digital transformation projects.\n\nhttp://www.stretchcon.com/"
