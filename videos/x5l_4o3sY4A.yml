title: 'Dockerize your Grails App for more deployment fun'
recordingDate: 1473447675
description: 'Do you know the pain of maintaining different Versions of Grails, Redis, PhantomJS or Postgres on your development box to work with various projects you’re involved in over time? Even if you get it done, how is this repeatable if a new colleague starts at your company? How do you set up testing environments for QA with different versions of your apps? Docker can be the answer to this. In this talk i will introduce Docker and tell you why it’s worth looking at from a developer''s perspective. Starting with different introductory examples, we will dockerize a “real world” Grails app with dependent services. Additionally we’ll have a look at the differences Grails 3 brings to the table regards containerization. You will learn that managing the mentioned problems and more becomes a breeze and can even be a lot of fun.'
