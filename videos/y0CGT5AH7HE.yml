title: 'OSCON 2013: "Create More Value Than You Capture" - Tim O''Reilly'
recordingDate: 1386888688
description: "At O'Reilly, we've always tried to live by the slogan \"Create more value than you capture.\" It's a great way to build a sustainable business and a sustainable economy.\n\nThe prevailing mentality of mainstream business has led to short term gain, but long term loss. Yet the economy depends on consumers as well as producers: as consumers are increasingly less able to find employment, we're going to have to start thinking about how to put people to work, rather than how to put them out of work.\n\nWe need to rethink our understanding of value and rediscover idealism in business. For entrepreneurs, there's a great opportunity to work on the hard problems that matter."
