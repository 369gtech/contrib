title: 'How Sleuth Bravely Cracked the Case of "Too Much to Code"'
language: English
recordingDate: 1538629050
description: "Spring Cloud Sleuth automatically traces Spring Boot applications. After adding a dependency on Sleuth, you see distributed traces across your apps, including latency and any errors. This works in Zipkin, or any system it can export data to, such as Google Stackdriver or Amazon X-Ray. Version 2 includes a lot more features and internally, it is completely rewritten! Most notably, sleuth no longer has its own tracer library. Instead, it delegates the work to Brave (Zipkin's standard tracer). This cooperation led to many integrations which until now, were not available for Sleuth. In this presentation we show what Sleuth and Brave are, how Sleuth has changed and which new and exciting features are in version 2!\nSeptember 26, 2018\n2:00 pm - 3:10 pm\nMaryland Ballroom A\n\nSpeakers:\nAdrian Cole\nZipkin guy, Pivotal\nMarcin Grzejszczak\nStaff Software Engineer, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
