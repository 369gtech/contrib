description: "Ближайшая конференция — DotNext 2020 Moscow\n2-5 декабря, Online\nПодробности и билеты: https://dotnext-moscow.ru/\n\n. Отладка и диагностика от знатока Windows Kernel.\n\nAnalyzing and profiling applications, native or managed, can be tricky and time-consuming.\n\nEvent Tracing for Windows (ETW) is a mature, low-overhead mechanism that provides events of all kinds that can help understand the way processes execute, measure various properties and generally help with profiling. In this mostly-demo session, we'll see how to create .NET tools that use ETW to capture information in real-time and offline and analyze these to get to the information we seek."
