Doing so when you don't even know yet what you want the code to do yet is quite a bit harder. Yet this is the job of a library writer -- the users of a library may have a very different use case from that of the original author.\n\nHow do library writers develop correct and efficient APIs that are also:\n\n- easy to use correctly - hard to use incorrectly - highly reusable - gracefully interoperable with other code\n\nThis talk gives lots of practical advice and techniques for accomplishing those goals and more.\n— \nZach Laine has been using C++ in industry for 12 years, focusing on data visualization, numeric computing, games, generic programming, and good library design. He finds the process of writing bio blurbs to be a little uncomfortable.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
