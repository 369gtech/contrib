description: "Speaker: Ridzwan Aminuddin from Ninjavan\r\n\r\nAs product guys we often have to work with APIs, yet many of us aren't even familiar with the concept of an API much less how to work with engineers who speak API. This session is meant to provide you with a high level overview of APIs and equip you with the fundamentals suitable for product managers and empower you to decipher and analyse common api document formats.\r\n\r\nRidzwan Aminuddin is an entrepreneurial and passionate product leader with deep experience in mobile, web, digital data and e-commerce. He has over 10 years experience leading product and technology teams to carry out large-scale, complex consumer/commercial enterprise products and services. Ridzwan is currently the head product guy at Ninja Van, and is focussed on building a kickass product team with world-class product practices to disrupt last-mile logistics in South East Asia. His favourite quote in product management is â€œA great product manager has the brain of an engineer, the heart of a designer, and the speech of a diplomat.\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/ProductTank-Singapore/events/249256495/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\r\nRecorded by: Dona Banerjee & Michael Cheng\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/ir6w/"
