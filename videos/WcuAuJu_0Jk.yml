description: "Solid Conference (http://oreil.ly/1PTSIu7) attendees will participate in an unprecedented demo as we manufacture Alike Bands live, right in the Solid demo pavilion, and hand them out to members of the audience. You'll see components become fully-functioning electronics on an assembly line, in an illustration of how fast and fluid the hardware process has become.\n\nAlike Bands connect people with common interests. Wear them at Solid to meet other members of the hardware and IoT community, and to see how social wearables might change the way we interact.\n\nThe IoT is creating a perfect storm of innovation and opportunity.\nBook your tickets today! https://en.oreilly.com/internet-of-things-2015/public/register\n\nHardware, software, sensors, and physical things are coming together in uncharted waters. To succeed, you’ll need to build teams that cross disciplines in ways never before attempted. Envision new business models. And recognize the “crazy” ideas that are now entirely possible. Learn how at Solid.\n\nhttp://twitter.com/oreillysolid\nhttps://facebook.com/OReilly\nhttp://youtube.com/oreilly\nhttps://plus.google.com/+oreillymedia/posts"
