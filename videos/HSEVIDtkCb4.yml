description: "by Johannes Kliemann\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/AW1.125/ada_bindings.webm\n\nLast year I presented Cappulada, a C++ binding generator for Ada that\nintended to overcome the shortcomings of existing solutions and to\nprovide usable bindings even for complex C++ code.\n\n\nThis year I want to show our conclusions on why automatic bindings\nbetween C++ and Ada are hard (if not impossible) and where existing\nsolutions (including our own) fail.\n\nRoom: AW1.125\nScheduled start: 2020-02-01 12:00:00"
