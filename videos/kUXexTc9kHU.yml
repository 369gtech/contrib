Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nManaging RBAC Cross Multiple Kubernetes Clusters - Alena Prokharchyk, Rancher Labs, Inc.\n\nHaving several Kubernetes clusters in the organization quickly became de facto. The need could be driven by geographical separation, where clusters are located in different regions; or logical when cluster is dedicated to a particular team or department. With that comes a new challenge for an administrator - managing users and their permissions in heterogeneous Kubernetes cloud.  During this session I want to share my team's experience building an open source authentication/authorization framework leveraging Kubernetes CRDs, that makes cross clusters auth and RBAC easy by having:  * Multiple clusters, but single authentication and authorization point  * Managing users RBAC permissions cross clusters, and automatic permission grant to the user  * Effective way of grouping cluster's resources into manageable subsets to make RBAC/PodSecurity/NetworkPolicy application easier.\n\nTo learn more click here: https://sched.co/FuLp"
