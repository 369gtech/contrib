That way you can see where those puzzle pieces you have been collecting fit into place. This video is going to be that bigger picture overview. We are going to build a small demo of an MVC application and its accompanying database. We will set up a form to collect data, capture that data, and put it into our database. We will then get that data back out of our database and display it on another form. The goal is to show the data access process from beginning to end in ASP.NET MVC. This won't be a full application and we won't complete the full process, since we won't be putting this in source control, we won't be deploying this application, and we won't be setting up authentication."
