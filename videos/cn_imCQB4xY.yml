title: 'Bootiful’ code with Spring Boot (Josh Long, USA)'
recordingDate: 1406754724
description: 'Alright, so maybe “”bootiful”” won’t ever work, but I tried, and it was worth it too because you’re reading this. Spring Boot, the new convention-over-configuration centric framework from the Spring team at Pivotal, marries Spring’s flexibility with conventional, common sense defaults to make application development not just fly, but pleasant! Join Spring developer advocate Josh Long @starbuxman for a look at what Spring Boot is, why it’s turning heads, why you should consider it for your next application (REST, web, batch, big-data, integration, whatever!) and how to get started. Let’s take advantage of the dynamic nature of a virtual JUG: I will be live coding and (attempting to) answer your questions on all things Spring and Spring Boot as I introduce the technology.'
