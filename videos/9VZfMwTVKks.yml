description: "With over an Exabyte of new data created daily on the Internet, wouldn't it be great if we could utilize Erlang to make sense of it?    \n\nErlang has great concurrency and built in MapReduce should this be a better fit than Hadoop? \nUnfortunately, today Erlang doesn't scale well enough and it doesn't have the I/O handling capabilities to match what the Hadoop and Grid computing communities can achieve. We'll talk about how they scale to thousands of servers in a cluster and handle gigabytes of I/O per second and and how we can learn from this to  make Erlang scale to match. \n\nTalk objectives:\n\nUnderstand how big data systems work today.\n\nExplore the options for improving Erlang and its ecosystem so its becomes the best solution for handling big data.   Side benefits of this would also improve performance in other large Erlang deployments such as some of the Cloud based systems now being built with Erlang\n\nTarget audience:\n\nAnybody interested in Erlang performance and scalability or  Big Data  or high performance computing"
