description: "Let’s Build a Python Profiler in 25 LOC\n[EuroPython 2018 - Talk - 2018-07-25 - Lammermuir]\n[Edinburgh, UK]\n\nBy Noam Elfanbaum\n\nA profile is a set of statistics that describes how often and for how long various parts of the program executed. Most profilers run inside your Python process.  If you’re inside a Python program you generally have pretty easy access to its stack, hence we can gather information about time spent in each level.\n\nIn this talk we'll build a Python profiler from scratch and so learn about the dynamic nature of Python and how do well-known profilers such as cProfile. \n\nWe'll also learn the difference between a tracing and a sampling profiler and which one to use in what circumstance.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2018.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
