description: "Presented at LOPUG, the London PaaS User Group.\n\nGoing from weeks to minutes for app deployments. 0 to 700 r/s and 0 to 800 apps in a year. Springer dev teams are globally distributed and there was no standardization. From commit to production was often more than 2 weeks. Provisioning new VMs, configuring networking, firewalls, load balancing, writing Chef; was a tedious task that nobody wanted to deal with. Tribal knowledge resulted in flaky systems resulting in dev teams became dependent on different Ops teams. When Platform Engineering started to hear the faint whispers, “miiiiicro services”, we knew we needed to do something drastic. This talk is about how CF changed the culture, allowing devs to own their apps in production and care less about operational hassles. And how Platform Engineering simplified operations and reduce costs across the board.\n\nSpeakers:\n\nSimon Johansson\nPlatform Engineer, Springer Nature\nSimon has spent the last 5 years working as both a dev and ops with startups and big enterprise. He has helped Springer Nature transform into a modern IT organization and is responsible for further development and operations of CF. He is crazy for music, functional programming, operations and photography.\n\nDaniel Otte\nHead of Platform Engineering, Springer Nature\nThey call me the Heisenberg of ops. I make cool explosions using my highly skilled chemicals. Right now I'm concocting a cloud foundry monster amongst other experiments. I am also a full time member of the moan society."
