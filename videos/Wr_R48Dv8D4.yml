language: English
recordingDate: 1555953519
description: "Tommy Lutz, Google\n\nAs SREs, we are all permanently on-call for our own well-being. Without proper monitoring and alerting about what's going on in our body, mind, and surroundings, we're likely to fall short of our own expectations regarding stress management, work-life balance, social interactions, and risk management. This talk provides an illustrative definition of mindfulness, provides practical examples of its usefulness in SRE, and builds the concept of self-monitoring that can improve performance both on the job and on the street.\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
