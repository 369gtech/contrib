description: "Chetan Vithlani\nPrincipal Technical Lead, Strategic Customer Programs\nOracle\n\nMoving toward continuous (or short-cycle) delivery? Constantly rewiring your apps with microservice and similar architectures? How are you planning to maintain visibility, maximize service levels and prevent threats and data loss once this stuff gets into production? Coding instrumentation into your apps is time-consuming and error prone. Instead, let machine learning do the work of adapting your monitoring and security regime to your fast-moving application environments. In this session, weâ€™ll discuss different types of machine learning that are optimized for operational and security data, and how they are leveraged to ensure SecOps moves as fast as the rest of your DevOps pipeline."
