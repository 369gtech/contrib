description: "Slides: http://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/iot-in-the-cloud-build-unleash-the-value-in-your-renewable-energy-system\n\nLearn how to build scalable, self-sustaining Embedded Ecosystems powered by small-scale Renewable Energy (solar, wind) systems, connect those systems to cloud services, and monitor & control them from your desktop, mobile device...or wearable!\n\nUsing low-cost, off-the-shelf hardware, see how to build self-sustaining sensor meshes and access them from anywhere in the world using cloud services for deployment, management, & data/trend analysis. Hardware components include Systems On a Chip (SOCs), microcontrollers, weather/environmental sensors, & physical control devices; software includes Java Embedded, Cloud services, & JavaScript.\n\nThis session introduces you to IoT & Cloud concepts and demonstrates how one necessitates the other."
