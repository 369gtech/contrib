title: 'ARM: Over 10 Billion Served—“Want 64-Bit Support with That?”'

description: "With more than 10 billion ARM-based devices shipped in 2013, ARM-based chips are used in a wide range of embedded systems. New ARM-designed low-power, multicore processors not only offer an enhanced platform for traditional embedded systems but are also projected to help drive new systems/markets such as microservers. Oracle’s Java SE for Embedded, which has long offered Java on ARM, has significant optimizations for these new ARM-based chips. Also under way is a collaborative port for the emerging 64-bit ARMv8 processor. This ARM/Oracle session covers the features and futures of these processors, Java optimizations for them, Java SE efforts for ARMv8, and how developers can take advantage of these enhanced platforms. Demo included.\n\n\nAuthors:\nDavid Holmes\nDr David Holmes has been working with the Java Platform since 1996.\n\nHe has worked closely with Professor Doug Lea in the area of Concurrent Programming in Java, and for many years presented concurrency tutorials with Doug, and others, at major international conferences (including OOPSLA, ECOOP, JAOO, TOOLS, and JavaOne). David was a member of the JSR-166 Expert Group that defined the initial java.util.concurrent Concurrency Utilities for Java 5 and continues to play a small role in its ongoing development. \n\nDavid is a co-author of \"Java Concurrency in Practice\" by Brian Goetz et al. And also co-author of \"The Java Programming Language\", third and fourth editions, with Ken Arnold and James Gosling.\n\nReturning to his undergraduate interest in real-time systems in the early 2000's, David got involved with the Technical Interpretation Committee for the Real-Time Specification for Java (RTSJ - JSR-001) and was heavily involved in producing the RTSJ 1.0.1 and 1.0.2 updates. He has since become a member of the Expert Group for JSR-282, which is defining RTSJ 1.1.\n\nDavid joined Sun Microsystems in late 2005 with the intent of joining the real-time Java team but initially was taken onboard the Hotspot VM Runtime group. He worked on various parts of the VM runtime but continued a focus on concurrency, threading and synchronization. In mid 2007 David transitioned to the development group for the Sun Java Real-Time System product.\n\nAs of March 2010, David became part of Oracle and continued working on the Java Platform in various guises. Primarily as a member of the Java SE VM Embedded and Real-Time team, within the Java Platform Group; but continuing to be involved in various Java language and library areas, particularly those relating to concurrency. In November 2011 David moved into the Libraries support team for the SE-Embedded convergence effort and worked primarily on the development of Compact Profiles for SE 8. In early 2013 David returned to the SE Embedded VM team.\nView more trainings by David Holmes at https://www.parleys.com/author/david-holmes-1\n\nZach Shelby\nZach Shelby is co-founder and Chief Nerd at Sensinode Ltd. where he leads research, standardization and web technologies for the company.
