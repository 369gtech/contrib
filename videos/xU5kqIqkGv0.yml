description: "\"OpenFlow - Bringing new levels of network control\" by Stuart Bailey and Steve Roberts\n\nThere is a lot of buzz about Software Defined Networking(SDN) and OpenFlow, which looks set to revolutionise IP networking. OpenFlow is a standard driven by the Open Networking Foundation (ONF) and it is a disruptive approach to networking, enabling new levels of network control.\n\nThis Webinar provides you with the opportunity to learn more about OpenFlow and how to get your own OpenFlow switch for free.\n\nBy providing open control of IP networking, OpenFlow provides solutions to problems that today's generation of IP networking technology struggles to solve. For example it allows centralised response to Denial of Service attacks, optimised routing performance for low latency applications such as video or optimised routing for Big Data analysis.\n\nLINC is a free, open source software based OpenFlow switch available from FlowForwarding.org. LINC was developed by Erlang Solutions for FlowForwarding.org and Infoblox, the primary sponsor.\n\nLINC is the first free switch to support all the latest OpenFlow protocols and because it is portable, it can be run on a wide range of hardware.\n\nLINC has been implemented in Erlang, the concurrent soft-real time programming language invented by Ericsson to develop their next generation networks.\n\n\nIn this webinar you'll learn:\n\n    What is OpenFlow and why it is different to traditional networking\n    What are the benefits of OpenFlow\n    Real world problems that can be solved by SDN & OpenFlow\n    How to build your own OpenFlow network using the free LINC software?"
