title: 'Correct by Construction: APIs That Are Easy to Use and Hard to Misuse - Matt Godbolt [ C++ on Sea ]'
language: English
recordingDate: 1595505611
description: "C++ gives us an awful lot of powerful constructs to use when designing APIs: strong types, RAII, templates, virtual functions and more. Some are easier to use than others, and some might be easy to use but easy to misuse. In this talk, Matt will cover some of the techniques you can use in your API and code in general to make it more difficult for users to make mistakes. You'll leave the talk with some new ideas to try out in your code bases: your future users (maybe yourself the very next day...) will thank you!\n\n-------\n\nMatt Godbolt is the creator of the Compiler Explorer website. He is passionate about writing efficient code. He has previously worked at a trading firm, on mobile apps at Google, run his own C++ tools company and spent more than a decade making console games. When he's not hacking on Compiler Explorer, Matt enjoys writing emulators for old 8-bit computer hardware.\n\n-------\n\nC++ on Sea is an annual c++ and coding conference, usually held in Folkestone, Kent in the UK. The 2020 conference was moved to a virtual event due to social distancing requirements.\n\nProduced and Edited by Digital Medium Ltd: https://events.digital-medium.co.uk\nEnquiries: events@digital-medium.co.uk"
