description: "Go, being a relatively recent statically typed, compiled language, is known to produce efficient programs. But writing a program in Go is not sufficient for good performance.\n\nIn this tutorial Dave will demonstrate three different methods of profiling Go programs to diagnose, then improve, the performance of several programs. By the conclusion, you’ll know how to profile the cpu and memory usage of a Go program, understand how to examine an execution trace, and come to grips with the reality of Amdahl’s Law."
