description: "The talk from DevOps Fest 2020 Online conference. \nPresentation: https://bit.ly/3dsuDrJ\nFb: https://www.facebook.com/DevOpsFest/\nWebsite: https://www.devopsfest.com.ua/\n\nOver the last years booming of cloud technologies created a lot of opportunities for business and together with IoT expansion established new niche: Edge Computing. Since it's one of the first speech within the UA community we will go through main points about the origin, business use cases, main frameworks, and challenges. Why DevOps people should start learning embedded programming aspects and why we shouldn't allow to register a cloud node after reboot? That's the questions what we'll also review with professional part of the audience."
