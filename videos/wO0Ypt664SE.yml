Wasm Fever has officially begun! And we at DeisLabs are releasing many Wasm-related projects. While it might seem like we're peppering the landscape with arbitrary tools and projects, we have a bigger vision in mind--one focused on building a community and an ecosystem that enables a new generation of portable and secure applications.
