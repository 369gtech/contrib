description: "Google I/O 2009 - Native Client: Using Native Code to Build Compute Intensive Web Applications\r\n\r\nBrad Chen\r\n\r\nSome applications require high-performance client-side computation. Native Client is a technology for running native code in web applications, with the goal of maintaining the browser neutrality, OS portability, and safety that people expect from web apps. This talk will give a brief overview of the architecture of Native Client. We'll then look at some specific example applications as well as strategies for how to use native code to handle compute intensive tasks within web applications using SRPC, Shared Memory and NPAPI. \r\n\r\nFor presentation slides and all I/O sessions, please go to: code.google.com/events/io/sessions.html"
