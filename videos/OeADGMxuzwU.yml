The evolution of a new feature in Node.js can take different twists and turns. Some new features land as experimental, to give time to gather user feedback before they’re considered stable. Other features will land as stable from the start. So, what’s in the pipeline? This talk will take a look at some of the new and experimental features in Node.js core.\n\nThis event would not take place without the support of sponsors:\n\nPlatinum Sponsors\nFocus Reactive → https://focusreactive.com/\n\nGold Sponsors\nAWS Amplify → https://docs.amplify.aws/\nRetool → https://retool.com/\nEpsagon → https://epsagon.com/\nInfluxdata → https://www.influxdata.com/\nStackHawk → https://www.stackhawk.com/\nG2i → https://www.g2i.co/ \n\nSilver Sponsors\nAppSignal → https://appsignal.com/\nSailscasts → https://sailscasts.com/\n\nDiversity Sponsor\nPrisma → https://www.prisma.io/"
