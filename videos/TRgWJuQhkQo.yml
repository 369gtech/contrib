description: "http://www.Cppcon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2015\n—\nThe talk will cover the CLANG + c2.dll compiler for the Microsoft platform. It will contain parts of the talk given at //Build 2015 that can be found on line: \"Compiling Objective-C Using the Visual Studio 2015 C++ Code Generation that Builds Windows, SQL, .Net, and Office\". The focus this time will be on C++.\n\nThe talk will disclose the architecture of how we tied the CLANG open source front end with the Microsoft optimizing backends (several configurations are needed) and how far we are from providing a CTP for public consumption targeting 4 different architectures. Included in this section will be a disclosure of data on compile time, memory consumption, conformance and correctness.\n\nIn addition the talk will cover the nuts and bolts of several key innovative compiler and runtime technologies we will be delivering in the Visual Studio 2015 updates (Fall, Winter and Spring). New investments in the compiler and runtime space include: Improved optimization and auto-vectorization, more secure code generation, incremental whole program compilation, and new asynchronous C++ code generation.\n— \nJames Radigan: Dev. Manager - Code Gen Technologies, Microsoft\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
