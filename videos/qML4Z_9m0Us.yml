description: "What Not to do When Building Service Brokers - Felisia Martini & Derik Evangelista, Pivotal \n\nThe Open Service Broker API is the specification that adds service capabilities to platforms like Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes. Central to the spec are the Service Brokers: components that live between the platform and the actual service.   But building brokers is hard. The spec is extensive and there are many details one can easily miss when implementing a service broker.  In this talk, we will show how to avoid common mistakes we learned from building service brokers at Pivotal, highlighting points like security, scalability, resilience and reliability. For that, we will leverage open source libraries that help with broker development and maintenance.\n\nFor more info: https://www.cloudfoundry.org/"
