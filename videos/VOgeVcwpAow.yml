title: 'Aaron Greenwald - Learn Once, Write Anywhere: Intro to React Native'
language: English
recordingDate: 1497069907
description: 'Two years ago, Facebook introduced a new way to develop native mobile applications using JavaScript: React Native. Though this doesn''t sound like a very revolutionary concept, the way Facebook chose to do it makes React Native stand out among its peers. In this talk, weâ€™ll take a look at what RN is, how it differs from its competition, and why we might want to use it. Geared toward developers with limited or no experience building mobile applications, it takes a high level view of the framework and makes a compelling case for considering it as part of your toolset.'
