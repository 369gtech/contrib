description: "In this episode of the Armchair Architect series of the #AzureEnablementShow, David Blank-Edelman is joined by Uli Homann, Microsoft Corporative Vice President and Distinguished Architect, and Eric Charran, Chief Architect at Microsoft for a conversation about low-code scenarios, fusion development, and Microsoft Power Apps.\n\nâœ…Resources:\nCI/CD for Microsoft Power Platform - Azure Solution Ideas https://aka.ms/azenable/70/01 \nBusiness Apps | Microsoft Power Apps https://aka.ms/azenable/70/02\nCitizen AI with the Power Platform - Azure Example Scenarios https://aka.ms/azenable/70/03\nFusion Development 101: Professional Developer Essentials - Events https://aka.ms/azenable/70/04\nWhat is the fusion development approach? - Power Apps https://aka.ms/azenable/70/05\n\n0:00 Introduction\n1:23 What does low-code mean?\n2:45 Low-code has democratized software development\n3:33 Next-gen low-code scenarios are offered as SaaS, allowing better change management and governance, etc.\n5:37 Are we bringing some of the lessons learned in versioning to the low-code scenario?\n6:13 Governance is key. Rights management can help limit who can make changes to a low-code app\n8:19 What advice can you offer someone who is a domain expert but not a developer and is creating low-code apps?\n8:56 How do architects know when a low-code solution is good enough or better than writing code?\n9:43 Power Platform is a SaaS solution that is designed so that a low-code app creator can't overwhelm the system\n10:28 If you're building a low-code application, you should think more about functionality than anything else\n11:43 Fusion development allows developers better enable connections between low-code and traditional apps.\n13:44 Architects need to embrace low-code since it is closer to the domain of people who are using it\n14:44 Fusion development is necessary due to the backlog of Enterprise apps that are needed.\n\nðŸ“º Related Episodes:\nArmchair Architects: Resiliency in the Cloud: an Introduction https://aka.ms/azenable/62\nArmchair Architects: Resiliency in the Cloud â€“ Core Patterns https://aka.ms/azenable/63\nArmchair Architects: Hybrid and Multi-Cloud Architectures an Introduction https://aka.ms/azenable/64\nArmchair Architects: Hybrid and Multi-Cloud Architectures - Feasibility https://aka.ms/azenable/65\nArmchair Architects: Hybrid and Multi-Cloud Architectures - Observability https://aka.ms/azenable/66\nArmchair Architects: Is that configurable? https://aka.ms/azenable/67\nArmchair Architects: How architecture is changing â€“ Containers and Collaboration Environments https://aka.ms/azenable/68\nArmchair Architects: How architecture is changing â€“ Serverless https://aka.ms/azenable/69\n\nðŸ”´ To watch more episodes in the Well-Architected Series, check out our playlist: https://aka.ms/azenable/yt/wa-playlist\n\nðŸ”´ Explore more cloud enablement resources! \nhttps://www.azure.com/enablement?WT.mc_id=azureenablement-ch9-cxa&WT.mc_id=azenable-68\n\nðŸ“² Connect:  David Blank-Edelman @otterbook \nhttps://twitter.com/intent/follow?original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fchannel9.msdn.com%2F&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&region=follow_link&screen_name=otterbook\n\nðŸ“² Connect: Eric Charran @mougue\nhttps://twitter.com/intent/follow?original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fchannel9.msdn.com%2F&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&region=follow_link&screen_name=mougue\n\n#Azure #AzureEnablementShow #WellArchitected"
