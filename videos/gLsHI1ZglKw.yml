recordingDate: 1363386515
description: "t the end of February, Strata returns to Santa Clara for the third year. In addition to our focus on the burgeoning field of Big Data, this year Strata is diving deep into the role of design and our inexorable march towards a connected world of ubiquitous computing.\n\nIn this free online conference, we'll be showcasing some of the hot topics and thought-provoking speakers who will be joining us for the event. It's your chance to see what we're covering and to find those can't-miss tracks and sessions. \n\nThe Business Singularity\nBy: Alistair Croll\n\nIn this session, Alistair Croll looks at how organizations that favour cycle time over scale are edging towards a singularity, and what that means for incumbents across a wide swath of industry. Alistair Croll has been an entrepreneur, author, and public speaker for nearly 20 years. In 2001, he co-founded web performance startup Coradiant, and since that time has also launched Rednod, CloudOps, Bitcurrent, Year One Labs, the Bitnorth conference, the International Startup Festival and several other early-stage companies.\nAlistair is the author of three books on web performance, analytics, and IT operations, and is currently working on a forthcoming book about data-driven startups. Find him at Solve For Interesting. \n\nZombie Diaries and Walking Vampires\nBy: John Feland\n\nNow we know who won the presidential election and the battle between red and blue states, but a more important battle is raging throughout the world. Will the blue blooded zombies beat out the red hot blooded vampires in the war for our souls and wallets? Hear Argus Insights CEO John Feland preview his Strata talk, understand the true nature of the threats haunting our homes, and learn what you can do to prepare for the coming Zompire Apocalypse. \n\nHow Operational Research Meets Artificial Intelligence\nBy: Elisabeth Crawford\n\nEvery month, Birchbox fills boxes with a mixture of beauty and lifestyle product samples. It then sends these products to its subscribers. But who gets what? In addition to physical constraints (i.e. size) and historical requirements (nobody should get the same thing twice), the company needs to maximize the reward and happiness of each box recipient. Birchbox CTO Elisabeth Crawford joins Strata chair Alistair Croll for a discussion of the challenges in product discovery, and how operational research meets artificial intelligence. Liz is the CTO at Birchbox. \n\nThe Recursive Approach to Visualization\nBy: Vadim Ogievetsky\n\nThis webcast session will discuss the manifestation of the split-apply-combine principle in both data visualization and data stores. Vadim Ogievetsky will discuss the possibility of unifying the two within the same declarative language in the hopes that such an approach will produce an efficient way to explore huge datasets. \n\nWake Up and Smell the Data\nBy: Mark Madsen\n\nBig data is a big part of the disruption hitting this market, but not in the way most people think. It's not replacing the data warehouse, but it is changing the technology stack. It doesn't eliminate data management, but it does redefine enterprise data architecture. Big data is and isn't many things. It's important to understand which information uses are well supported and which have yet to be addressed. Otherwise you risk replacing one set of problems with another. Come to this session to hear some observations on what big data is, isn't and aspires to be. \n\nSQL and the Future of Big Data\nBy: Tim O'Brien\n\nIn this webcast presentation, Tim O'Brien explores some of the projects and products that are helping people scale without having to move entire applications to novel databases. Databases like Translattice, NuoDB, and Akiban along with Google's high-profile, internal database Spanner, point towards a larger trend of scale data without throwing away the standard features of a database. The provocative question: is NoSQL simply a temporary way point, a momentary break, as the relational database adapts and underlying concepts like consensus algorithms adapt to new realities? T\n\nA Model Strategy for Data Journalism in a Country Without Open Data\nBy: Sandra Crucianelli and Angélica Peralta Ramos\n\nIn a country where there is no open data nor a law like FOIA, there is a Data Team that is creating tools to help reporters and also citizens to analyze material and investigate important stories such as the use of public money. At La Nación, one of Argentina's leading daily newspapers, we have created a data model of journalism, based on teamwork, involving reporters and editors, to take an interest in writing stories based on data. But this is not all the story.\n\nProduced by: Yasmina Greco"
