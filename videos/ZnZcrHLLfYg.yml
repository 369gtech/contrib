description: "In less than a week, we’ll be hosting our first ever virtual DevOps Enterprise Summit London (23-25 June 2020).\n\nOver the past three months, we've been putting together the finest programming that we've ever created. As we've gone through the lineup of speakers, we wanted to share a couple of them with you.\n\nA few that absolutely blew us away were:\n\n1. “How a Colossus Took a Duck and Turned it into a Unicorn: the Quest to Reinvent a 156-year-old Reinsurance Company from the inside” by Victoria Mayo, Head of Compliance, and James Head, Interim Head of Delivery, from Swiss Re.\n\n2. “Team of Teams: New Rules of Engagement for a Complex World” by David Silverman, co-author of Team of Teams, & Founder and CEO, CrossLead, Inc.\n\nTo show you how amazing these talks are, we put together a trailer for you 😎\n\nRegister today – it's the only way to see the 70+ talks that we have in store right away. These talks won't be made public until late this year: https://events.itrevolution.com/virtual/\n\nMy thanks to Victoria Mayo and James Head, and David Silverman — to contact David Silverman and his colleagues at CrossLead, email Jessica Reif: jess.reif@crosslead.com"
