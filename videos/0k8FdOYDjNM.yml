language: English
recordingDate: 1517540400
description: "Company Culture and Employee Engagement aren't just popular buzzwords - really understanding what makes your teams tick can lead to a significant difference in company performance, profitability, customer satisfaction. At Agile Australia in 2016 I presented a Culture Manifesto derived from data from over 100,000 survey responses from engagement and exit surveys at more than 150 companies, many of them in the New Tech space, and explained why factors such as effective company leadership, and learning and development, can have a real impact on improving engagement and reducing turnover.\n\nIn this talk I will dig in to the topics of leadership and growing people, with updated insights from more recent data, and explain some of the differences we see in groups such as engineering teams, and at different stages of company growth. I will present stories from our own company and other case studies, where people have taken action and the differences we see.\n\nYou will appreciate the importance of effective leadership and developing people and how it contributes to engagement; gain insights into the drivers of engagement and turnover; and also hear about the things that we expect would make a difference, but the data proves us wrong!\n\nJo is a Director of Engineering based in Melbourne, Australia at Culture Amp, an all-in-one people feedback and analytics platform. Although Jo has been a Senior Business Analyst and Product Planner, coding is her real passion. She's worked with Lonely Planet, Atlassian, ThoughtWorks and Expedia and was CTO of a startup accepted into Telstra's Muru-D program. When not coding her happy place is under the sea - she's a qualified scuba diving instructor.\n\nFor more on YOW! conferences, visit http://www.yowconference.com.a"
