description: "by Giannis Giannelos\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/UA2.114/web_compatibility_and_ml.webm\n\nIn 2019, Mozilla's Open Innovation and WebCompat team joined forces to improve the process of gathering web compatibility issues. One of the experiments was to introduce machine learning capabilities in the triaging process and automate some steps. This talk is about the early steps and how we got some hands on experience with machine learning, what we've achieved so far and potential next steps.\n\nRoom: UA2.114 (Baudoux)\nScheduled start: 2020-02-02 11:45:00"
