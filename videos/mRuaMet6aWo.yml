description: "You most likely write .NET code. Or Javascript. Do you even wonder how your machine \"understands it\"? You're probably aware that it runs on VM, but what lies beneath it? We need to go deeper!\nIn this talk we'll look into Intel's x86 architecture, go all the way down to 0s and 1s and try to write some code on each level. If you know what is EAX, what INC does and know what pointers are, there will be nothing new in this talk for you, but you may enjoy refreshing old days. If you have been writing Javascript whole your life, but you are interested what runs on \"the metal\", you will like it."
