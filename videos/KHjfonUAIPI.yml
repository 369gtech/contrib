description: "by Daniele Scasciafratte\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/UA2.114/how_to_get_fun_with_teamwork.webm\n\nThe story of how Mozilla Italia added the Italian language to Common Voice and after an year generated the language model.\nWith the help of a lot of people in the various related project, developing tools and scripts, find and gather the sentences, do promotion and finally generate the model for Italian.\nA common issue in Common Voice is how to join and involve a community instead of doing all the tasks alone. Discourse is full of the same questions but there is no story or tutorial that show how this can be a way to work together for the same result, to benefit all the country/region.\nMozilla is an inclusive community but the user case or the story behind from a specific community often is hidden and this is a problem, because Mozilla is open to everyone but the bureaucracy or the missing experience can be a blocker.\n\n\nPlease note that this replaces the talk '(re)Activating the Common Voice project at a local level' by Redon Skikuli.\n\nRoom: UA2.114 (Baudoux)\nScheduled start: 2020-02-02 14:00:00"
