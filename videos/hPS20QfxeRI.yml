title: 'YOW! Connected 2016 Tim Nugent - Physics, and Other Meaningless Tweaks Your Users Will Love!'
recordingDate: 1486943084
description: "This talk covers the use of physics and similar real world effects in your applications to make them, well more physical. Despite Apple’s push towards ugly design (and now slow move back towards something useful) your users still like their apps to work the way the real world works and I think deep down inside Apple knows this. There is a slew of great APIs which are rarely used to make your app a lot more real feeling.\n\nIn this session we will take a look at:\n\n* skeuomorphic and playful interactions from both a designer and developer perspective\n* some good examples of apps using skeuomorphic design even in the current iOS landscape\n* some good examples of apps using playful interactions\ncover the techniques and APIs Apple has provided to use these design elements in your apps\n* Live code demo (because they always work) of some of these techniques to show how easy they are to implement\n\n*** User love is not guaranteed.\n\nTim Nugent pretends to be a mobile app developer, game designer, and PhD student, and now he’s even pretending to be an author. (He co-wrote the latest versions of Learning Cocoa with Objective-C, Swift Developement with Cocoa, Learning Swift, and the Kerbal Space Program Players Guide for O’Reilly.) When he isn’t busy avoiding being found out as a fraud, Tim spends most of his time designing and creating little apps and games he won’t let anyone see. He also spent a disproportionately long time writing this tiny little bio, most of which was taken up trying to stick a witty sci-fi reference in… before he simply gave up.\n\nFor more on YOW!
