title: 'GopherCon 2020: Robert Griesemer - Typing [Generic] Go'
language: English
recordingDate: 1608668486
description: 'In early 2020, the Go team announced the latest generics design draft. The key feature is the notion of constrained type parameters which enable generic functions and types. In this talk, Robert Griesemer explains how type parameters fit into Go''s existing type system and how a compiler goes about type-checking generic Go code. If you are interested in a deeper understanding of generics for Go, this talk is for you!'
