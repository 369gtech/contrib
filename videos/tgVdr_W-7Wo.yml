description: "As healthcare organizations gain access to more and more data, they rely increasingly on complex systems and predictive tools to make sense of it all. This has led to a divide between those who perform data analysis (programmers, statisticians, database administrators) and those who make decisions (physicians, insurance administrators, policy makers). In addition, the needs of those users are fairly heterogeneous, even a on a single data set.\n\nIn this presentation, we will show a working system that bridges the gap between data analysis and decision making using a carefully composed set of big-data technologies mated with an interactive, high-level interface. By leveraging a powerful backend infrastructure and an intuitive set of analytical tools, health professionals ranging from physicians to insurance analysts can perform interactive, real-time analysis on all data within their enterprise.\n\nAbout Lauren Chaparro\n\nLauren Chaparro is an Engineer and leads Palantir Health business development.
