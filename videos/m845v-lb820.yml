description: "DevOpsDays Baltimore 2019 - Ignite: How DevOps Anti-patterns Ruin Holidays by Leon Fayer\n\nBehind the extensive downtimes I witness every holiday, I see a corporate failure to change the archaic processes to match the change in business models. Technology space has evolved. Businesses, however, especially larger ones, have a natural aversion to change, that is often justified by risk and cost factors. However, processes are put in place for exactly that reason — to save time and money. If they don’t accomplish those two goals or worse, contributing to the opposite – they need to be changed. It this talk I discuss a real-world example of Black Friday 8 hour downtime of a large e-commerce website and discuss key anti-DevOps patterns contributing to the failure.\n\n#confreaks #devopsdaysbmore"
