description: "Google I/O 2010 - Data migration in App Engine \r\n\r\nApp Engine 201 \r\n\r\nMatthew Blain \r\n\r\nLearn about the App Engine bulk loader and see an example of migrating data from an external data source into the app engine datastore--and back out. Do you have data stored in a traditional, relational DB which you'd like to upload to App Engine? This session will teach you how. \r\n\r\nFor all I/O 2010 sessions, please go to http://code.google.com/events/io/2010/sessions.html"
