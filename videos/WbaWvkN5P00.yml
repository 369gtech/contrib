Especially, when you consider different OS’s, locales, and resolutions your mobile app supports.\n\nAdding an app crawler to your CI pipeline is ideal for environments when your app is in constant change or development. A app crawler will look at the new build when others in your company may not. A app crawler might find a issue where automated test were not programmed to."
