title: 'Sponsor Demo: Datadog - Autoscaling Workloads in Kubernetes'

description: "Containers and orchestrators — like Kubernetes — promise greater resource efficiency and simplified deployments.  Developers provide code in the form of a container, define their required resources for operation, and the orchestrator does the rest. Sounds easy, but if your workloads are dynamic in nature, how can you ensure sufficient resources to meet the performance and availability requirements of your customers?\nIn this demo video we will use a demo e-commerce application to showcase how to autoscale your application workloads on Kubernetes, including vertical autoscaling, horizontal autoscaling with external metrics server and she will introduce the Watermark Pod Autoscaler, an open source project created by Datadog that extends the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler with new features."
