title: '[VDM19] HPC green computing: relationships among throughput and latency by Tullio Menga'
language: English
recordingDate: 1557932191
description: 'Nowadays there is an increasing demand for fast data processing - high throughputs and low latencies - for higher and higher amounts of data. Such a demand has an important drawback on hardware costs and, ultimately, on power consumption and CO2 emissions. We will explore a use case where modern C++ meta-programming strongly reduces hardware requirements for message processing tasks and, furthermore, we will investigate the relationship between latency requirements and power consumptions.'
