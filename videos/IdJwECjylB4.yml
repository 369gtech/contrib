description: "Erlang Factory SF Bay Area 2013\nMore info and slides on the website: http://www.erlang-factory.com/conference/SFBay2013/talks\n\nOne of the most common questions on Stack Exchange is \"Why does Erlang syntax resemble Prolog with asphyxia?\" [1]\n\nIn this talk, Garrett will obliterate the notion that Erlang syntax is weird or that you can't use it to write beautiful code. The plain truth is that it's easier to write beautiful code in Erlang than it is in most other languages.\n\nGarrett will describe methods for writing luscious, gorgeous, easy to read and maintain Erlang programs. He will cover topics such as:\n\n- API design\n- Function and variable names\n- Proper use of case and if expressions\n- Managing complex data structures\n- Code refactoring\n- Common functional patterns\n\nGarrett will draw from the coding styles of the Erlang masters as well as his own experience an Erlang programmer and instructor. He will argue will a zeal bordering on religious fervor, chiding those with different views. [2]\n\n[1] In fact, not a common question on Stack Exchange\n\n[2] No one will be chided -- the presentation will be quite congenial"
