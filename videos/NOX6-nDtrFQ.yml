description: "( Hadoop Training: https://www.edureka.co/hadoop )\nCheck out our HBase Tutorial blog series: https://goo.gl/jXMW8m\nThis NoSQL Database and Apache HBase tutorial is specially designed for Hadoop beginners. Apache HBase is an open-source, distributed, non-relational database modeled after Google’s Bigtable and written in Java. It provides capabilities similar to Bigtable on top of Hadoop and HDFS (Hadoop Distributed Filesystem) i.e. it provides a fault-tolerant way of storing large quantities of sparse data, which are  common in many big data use cases. HBase is used for real time read/write access to Big Data.\n\nWatch Sample Class Recording: http://goo.gl/fKrT1W\n\nThis videos covers following topics :\n\n1. NoSQL databases\n2.What is Hbase?\n3.Where to use HBase?\n4.Where not to Use HBase?\n5.The Advent of HBase.\n6.Hbase Architecture.\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/edurekaIN/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/edurekain\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/edureka\n\nRelated Blog Posts:\nhttp://www.edureka.co/blog/overview-of-hbase-storage-architecture/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=nosql-hbase-tut\n\nhttp://www.edureka.co/blog/hive-data-models/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=nosql-hbase-tut\n\nhttp://www.edureka.co/blog/pig-vs-hive/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=nosql-hbase-tut\n\nEdureka is a New Age e-learning platform that provides Instructor-Led Live, Online classes for learners who would prefer a hassle free and self paced learning \nenvironment, accessible from any part of the world. \n\nAll topics related to ‘HBase and NoSQL’ have extensively been covered in our course ‘Big Data and Hadoop’.\nFor more information, please write back to us at sales@edureka.co \nCall us at US: 1800 275 9730 (toll free) or India: +91-8880862004"
