The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nKeynote: Kubernetes as a Foundational Layer of Infrastructure – Vicki Cheung, Engineering Manager, Lyft\n\nAt a reasonably sized tech company these days, the infrastructure has to support a variety of use cases:  - Production Microservices  - Batch Workflows  - Machine learning training and deployment with GPUs  - Research & Development  Not to mention that certain use cases might need custom hardware, thus requiring multi / hybrid cloud. The challenge for our infrastructure team is to keep the overall systems complexity down, while providing an extensible, scalable platform. A year and a half ago, I talked about using Kubernetes for deep learning research at scale. Since then, the platform has matured at an incredible pace. In this talk, I will cover why Kubernetes is the platform of choice for Lyft, as well as challenges and surprises along the way, what use cases were most natural, and how we're migrating production traffic.\n\nTo learn more click here: https://sched.co/FzGv"
