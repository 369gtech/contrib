description: "Speaker: BURK HUFNAGEL TECHNICAL ARCHITECT, DAUGHERTY BUSINESS SOLUTIONS\nLearn how to use Spring Boot and Spock to efficiently design, implement, and test a microservice so that the resulting code is clean, flexible, and easily maintained. By following this process, the business requirements will always accurately describe how the code behaves, and developers will always have accurate documents other developers can use to understand how the code works and how to use it properly. You will also have fewer bugs, and it will be easier to find and fix the bugs that do occur. This may sound too good to be true, but the process works and organizations around the world use it to improve the quality of their code while shortening delivery times."
