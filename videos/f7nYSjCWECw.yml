description: "DOES19 Las Vegas — Don't be legacy.  Be heritage.  Modernize.\n\nIn our past talks we covered both the radical people and process changes at CSG.  This started with our Lean/Agile Transformation in 2012, followed by our DevOps Transformation in 2016 and integrating Product Management into DevOps thinking in 2018.\n \nThis year we will cover the great modernization work we have done at CSG.  As a company with a strong culture of engineering excellence we saw it vital not to act like a legacy company. As part of this, we knew we had to invest in modernization and remove technical debt. In 2010 we set out to completely modernize and transform our technology and application stack. This included Foundational Modernization such as: E2E Version Control, Automated Testing, Telemetry and Infrastructure Modernization.\n\nWe then focused on a multiyear effort to modernize our application stack by moving to commodity and OSS. We also have made great strides to modernize our mainframe technology.\n\nDevOps & Modernization: An Engineering Excellence Story - Scott Prugh\nScott Prugh, Chief Architect & SVP Software Development, CSG\n\nScott Prugh, Chief Architect & VP Software Development.
