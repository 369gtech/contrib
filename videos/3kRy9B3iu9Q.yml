title: 'Fear and Loathing after Production (Serhiy Kalinets, Ukraine)'
recordingDate: 1486916045
description: "Remember situation when on the next day after successful release your system goes crazy as well as your stakeholders? Endless meetings with angry customers when you have no idea what is wrong with your system. You either have no logs or they are full with useless messages giving no any glue to the root cause. Your monitoring either does not exists (was planned for the next release â€“ yeah!) or shows that everything is OK. Remember all that? I bet every developer was in similar situation or at least heard of it.\n\nIn this talk Serhiy will tell how to avoid such unpleasant life experience. What and how should be logged. Where logs should be stored. What monitoring should be in place. How codes should be written. Tools, practices and so on. Basically speaking, things that should reduce your stress and make your life happier.\n\nInterested? Come to my talk then!"
