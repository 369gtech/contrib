title: 'Building Amazing Robots with the BeagleBone Black'
recordingDate: 1421874009
description: "Originally aired June 26, 2014.  The price of do-it-yourself pieces in the electronics space has dropped to a point where anyone can build amazing robots for a very low investment. However, many need help to get started. This webcast provides both motivation and direction that begins with the unpacking of the BeagleBone Black, the brain of the system, and continues all the way through adding hardware to provide a fully functional, walking, talking, listening, seeing robot. We'll also touch on advanced topics, such as how to communicate with your robots wirelessly and how to add GPS. Then, you'll learn how to integrate all of this functionality so that you can construct impressive robotics projects that can roll, walk, sail, fly, and explore under the water.\n\nAbout Richard Grimmett\n\nRichard Grimmett has always been fascinated by computers and electronics from his very first programming project that used Fortran on punch cards. He has a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Electrical Engineering and a PhD in Leadership Studies. He also has 26 years of experience in the Radar and Telecommunications industries, and even has one of the original brick phones. He now teaches Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at Brigham Young University - Idaho where his office is filled with many of his robotics projects."
