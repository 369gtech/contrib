title: 'Graham Termarsch - "Building a Culture of Learning and Sharing"'
language: English
recordingDate: 1529421392
description: "At ZipRecruiter, we still believe that “you learn something new every day”.\n\nIn early 2017, Graham started a casual “brown bag lunch” webinar series at ZipRecruiter, to share some of his experiences and knowledge with the team. Twenty-three talks later, we’ve had a ton of fun, discussed a wide range of topics, and learned a lot (not just about software development, but about how to run a successful discussion series).\n\nCome listen to Graham talk about how it started, what worked, what didn’t work, and how you can start one up in your own organization."
