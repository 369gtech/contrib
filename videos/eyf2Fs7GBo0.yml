description: "\"One size does not fit all.\" And this is still specially true for your distributed data! Different types of data require different approaches of how you distribute & manipulate your data.\n\nUpdate frequency? Staleness? Push or pull? Legacy or new? Cache or direct read? Event Sourcing? Business or low-level events? Check this session to see how different technologies such as Data Virtualization, Change Data Capture, In-memory Data Grids, Reactive Programming and much more can be applied to solve a plethora of different data scenarios with different requirements.\n\nEdson Yanaga, Red Hat's Director of Developer Experience, is a Java Champion and Microsoft MVP. He is also a published author and a frequent speaker at international conferences, discussing Java, Microservices, Cloud Computing, DevOps, and Software Craftsmanship."
