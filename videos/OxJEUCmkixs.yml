description: "Keynote: Kubernetes, Istio, Knative: The New Open Cloud Stack - Aparna Sinha, Group Product Manager for Kubernetes, Google \n\nKubernetes has succeeded in its initial mission. Launched by Google as an open source platform built on the foundations of Borg, Kubernetes has grown into an enterprise platform, with a strong community and adoption across all major industries. But Kubernetes is not meant to merely run on multiple clouds, it is meant to be a complete cloud that shields users from the underlying infrastructure, while providing developers a secure, efficient, productive experience for developing and operating any app. During this presentation, we describe the full-stack vision of a Kubernetes-native cloud. One that spans on-prem and cloud providers, serves all types of applications and provides a serverless developer experience. We demonstrate the vision with a stack that mirrors closely what Google has built internally and now open sourced to the Kubernetes ecosystem. \n\nTo Learn More: https://sched.co/Gsvi"
