Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nPolicy Matters! The Why, What, and How of Kubernetes Policy Management - Jayashree Ramanathan, RedHat; Aradhna Chetal, TIAA; Jim Bugwadia, Nirmata; Robert Ficcaglia, SunStone Secure\n\nPolicies help address several critical challenges with managing Kubernetes clusters and workloads. In the panel-style session moderated by Robert Ficcaglia, co-chair of the Kubernetes Policy Working Group, contributors from the working group will discuss why policies are important to enterprises and other organizations using Kubernetes. Attendees will have an opportunity to ask policy engine and compliance experts about real world use cases and effective techniques for managing policy-as-code from a small cluster to enterprise multi-cluster scale. Attendees will see examples of how to map real world threats to their systems to specific policy automation tools and how compliance automation helps defend against emerging risks and provides greater visibility and enforcement of best practices."
