description: "Learning to code is full of AHA moments, failing forward, clarity, confusion, and everything in between. And learning how data plays a role is the code we write adds another layer of excitement. Sarah (Dr. G) has dedicated her professional career to not only learning new things, but also learning how people learn new things. \nWhile earning her PhD in computer science, she focused on building curriculum and tools to help novices of all ages take their first steps on their personal coding journey. Along the way, sheâ€™s taught thousands of children, career changers, teachers, and university professors how to code, and more importantly, about the two most important pieces to success: perseverance and community. \nJoin Dr. G on our collaborative journey through code, data science, and machine learning and become a part of that community! With the power of Visual Studio Code, Azure, and some creative fun you can test your own persistence, learn something new, and likely teach something too!\n\nRelevant Links:\n@drguthals | #LearnWithDrG | https://aka.ms/LearnWithDrG\nhttps://ml.azure.com/\nhttps://portal.azure.com/\nhttps://azure.microsoft.com/free/students/ | https://azure.microsoft.com/free/\nhttps://aka.ms/LearnWithDrG/DevIntroDS-Videos\nhttps://aka.ms/LearnWithDrG/DevIntroDS-Learn\nhttps://aka.ms/LearnWithDrG/AzureMLSDK11"
