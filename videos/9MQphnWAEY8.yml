description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io\n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nDeep Dive: Rook - Jared Watts, Upbound\n\nIn this talk, we will be taking a deep-dive through the architecture of the Rook project. Rook is an open source cloud-native storage orchestrator for Kubernetes, providing the platform, framework, and support for a diverse set of storage solutions to natively integrate with cloud-native environments. We will learn about the various extension mechanisms of Kubernetes as well as patterns like controllers/operators, resource management, and rolling upgrades to understand how to build a fully automated storage solution for cloud-native environments. Weâ€™ll also dive into how operators are built and orchestration is performed for some specific storage solutions such as Ceph, CockroachDB, Minio and NFS. Rook was accepted as the first storage project hosted by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation in January 2018.\n\nTo learn more click here: https://sched.co/FuLc"
