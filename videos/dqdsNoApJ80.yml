recordingDate: 1557111000
description: "\"Speaker: Anthony Shaw\n\nEveryone starts with the best intentions with their Python projects, \"\"this time it's going to be clean, simple and maintainable\"\". But code evolves over time, requirements change and codebases can get messy and complicated quickly.\n\nIn this talk, you will learn how to use `wily` to measure and graph how complicated your Python code is and a series of practical techniques to simplify it. `wily` will show you which parts of your projects are becoming or have become hard to maintain and need a refactor. Once you know where the skeletons are, you will learn practical techniques for refactoring \"\"complex\"\" code and some resources to use to take your refactoring to the next level.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2019 and https://github.com/PyCon/2019-slides\""
