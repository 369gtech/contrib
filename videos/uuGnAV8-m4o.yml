language: English
recordingDate: 1449894055
description: "Design patterns are not only cool but also bring years of collective wisdom to developers at every level. Since GoF, many books have been written and words shed, and many new concepts such as enterprise and domain design patterns have extended the coverage of the design patterns, originally shared by the famous Gang of Four. Unlike in the J2EE 1.4 era, Java EE provides easy and out-of-the-box implementations of many well-known design patterns such as Singleton, Facade, Observer, Factory, dependency injection, Decorator, data access patterns, MVC, and even more. Many classical design patterns are actually just one annotation away from your project. Attend this session to watch and learn from live coding demos of design patterns in Java EE.\n\nSpeakers:\nReza Rahman, Java EE Evangelist, Oracle\nReza Rahman is a long time former independent consultant and now officially a Java EE evangelist at Oracle.
