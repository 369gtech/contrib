description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nDevOps Performance From a Different Dataset: What 30M Workflows Reveal - Michael Stahnke, CircleCI  \n\nWhat can we learn about DevOps best practices by looking at data from a SaaS with 900K dev users, 25K orgs and 30m+ builds a month, particularly when compared with surveys where users opt-in? Join CircleCI's VP of Platform, Mike Stahnke, to understand what this unique dataset uncovers about high performing engineering teams: - What trends stand out from the data? - Are they different than what is seen through surveys where responders opt-in to participating as compared to being aggregated through platform usage? \n\nhttps://sched.co/ekB1"
