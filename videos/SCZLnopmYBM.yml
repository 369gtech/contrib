It is currently seeing growing adoption across many domains and is already being used to build large chunks of most modern Linux distributions. One of the main reasons for this is Meson's heavy focus on usability, meaning that build definitions are both powerful and easy to understand. \n\nIn this talk we shall look into the design and use of Meson from the ground up going up all the way to projects with millions of lines of code and complex build setups such as code generators and cross compilation. We shall especially examine the problem of dependencies and how Meson solves this age old problem with a composable design that supports both system provided and self built dependencies from the same build definition. Finally we will examine the multi-language support of Meson for easily combining C++ with other languages such as Java, C#, D and Python.\n— \nJussi Pakkanen, Consultant\nJussi Pakkanen is the creator and project lead of the Meson build system. He is currently working as a consultant. He has experience in many different fields of computing ranging from slot machines to mail sorting, computer security, Linux desktop development and gaming. His free time has been equally colorful, including things such as comics and illustration, directing movies, music and electronics. When not working on projects he might be found watching bad movies, especially sci-fi and the finest of trash from the 80s.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
