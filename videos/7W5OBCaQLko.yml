description: "Introduction to the Cloud Foundry 101: Getting Started Track - Xiujiao Gao, Stark & Wayne & Jared Ruckle, Pivotal\n\nThis track covers the most important topics to help you get started with Cloud Foundry (CF). Regardless of your role, you’ll learn how to get up and running with CF. You will learn that CF supports a wide range of application architectures, so you know what workloads are a good fit for the platform.\n\nYou’ll learn from veteran CF operators. These folks have deployed and run the platform at scale and will share what they have learned.\n\nWhat about the developer experience? We will take a deep look at examining how to use CF to manage applications and backing services. We will learn about building pipelines, and how CI/CD can plug into CF.\n\nThis track has something for everyone because all the technologies that touch CF are so diverse. We will learn about .NET with CF. If you’re more familiar with Kubernetes, you can learn how CF compares with this orchestrator.\n\nServices are extremely important for apps. So we focus on how the open service broker framework works, and how it helps you run services across CF and Kubernetes.\n\nWe also know that security is important, authentication and authorization are always hot topics. You will learn how to deploy and use UAA both inside and outside of CF.\n\nAnd finally, every vibrant open-source community needs as a growing pool of thoughtful, responsible contributors. How can you take part? We’ll discuss that too.\n\nAbout Xiujiao Gao\nXiujiao Gao currently works as a Client Lead & Cloud Engineer at Stark & Wayne.
