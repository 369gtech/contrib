description: "Full title - Romeo Kienzler: Trusted AI – Building Reproducible, Unbiased and Robust AI Pipelines using the python OpenSource stack\n\nUntrusted AI doesn’t make it into production. The concerns are just too high. In this talk we’ll show how data lineage, bias detection, adversarial robustness and model explainability can be achieved using an open source stack\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
