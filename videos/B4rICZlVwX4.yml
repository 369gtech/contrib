description: "Presented at droidcon Italy 2020\n\nPRACTICAL GUIDE TO PERFORMANCE BENCHMARKS - AUTOMATICALLY DETECT INEFFICIENT CODE LIKE GOOGLE\nPaulina Sadowska, Mobile Software Engineer, Allegro\n\nWith the release of Jetpack Benchmark Library now we can measure code performance within Android Studio. But what are the real benefits for you and commercial projects you work on?\n\nIn this talk, I’ll show on practical examples the real potential of this tool. I’ll present how it allows to easily experiment and instantly learn if the changes influence the app performance.\n\nWe will also look at how Google uses Benchmarks and how to create a process on CI to automatically detect inefficient code right after it’s introduced to the project.\n\nhttps://it.droidcon.com/2020/​​​​​​\nhttps://twitter.com/Droidconit​​​​​​\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/showcase/droidcon-italy\nhttps://www.facebook.com/droidconIt"
