description: "From the 2014 Solid Conference: In this day and age, we usually consider robots to be utilitarian, problem solvers. But there is another use for robots, that is for artistic expression.\n\nIn this fun, energetic talk, we will explore controlling multiple robots in real time. Roombas sway to gentle computer generated music, while Sphero balls roll with flashing lights. This robot jam will culminate in spectacular finale when the AR Drones fly in to join the dance.\n\nAbout Carin Meier (Neo):\nCarin started off as a professional ballet dancer, studied Physics in college, and has been developing software for both the enterprise and entrepreneur ever since. She has a thing for Clojure and can be usually found with a cup of tea in her hand, hacking on her Roomba and AR Parrot Drone.\n\nAbout Peter Shanley (Neo):\nPeter has a passion for customer-centered product design and organizational change, having worked in both large enterprises and startups to bring new ventures to market. He held intrepreneurial roles at Yahoo! Brickhouse and HP Labs/Snapfish, and he led a strategic pivot at the startup Betable.com.\n\nFor more information on the Solid Conference, visit http://solidcon.com.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to O'Reilly to get SolidCon videos as they release: http://goo.gl/szEauh\nStay Connected to O'Reilly Media by Email - http://goo.gl/YZSWbO\n\nFollow O'Reilly Media:\nhttp://plus.google.com/+oreillymedia\nhttps://www.facebook.com/OReilly\nhttps://twitter.com/OReillyMedia"
