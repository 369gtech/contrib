title: '[JSConfUS 2013] Stephen Bannasch: A JavaScript framework for computational simulations'
recordingDate: 1381852445
description: "Two years ago the Google Foundation awarded us a major grant to develop a JavaScript + HTML5 version of our educational physics simulation called Molecular Workbench\n\nBecause Javascript is fast and the web is ubiquitous, we have extended the work to create a general framework for publishing explorable scientific simulations that run in the browser,\n\nFrom the beginning we've kept a close eye on performance and extensibility.\n\nWe'll show off our framework and talk about the lessons we've learned regarding this relatively new form of web app.\nImage: https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5810a1b7743eb2186ca0ea1d0a3469a0?s=140&d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-user-420.png\nI agree to release any and all audio and video recording and broadcast rights to JSConf for publication"
