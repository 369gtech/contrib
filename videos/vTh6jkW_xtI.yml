description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nBuildKit CLI for kubectl: A New Way to Build Container Images - Daniel Hiltgen & Patrick Devine, VMware\n\nThe Dockerfile is a tremendously popular format used to build container images. Various projects exist that focus on CI for Dockerfiles inside a kubernetes cluster, but what about developers and their inner loop? In this talk we’ll introduce a new CLI plugin optimized for developers which implements a familiar UX for building container images. It utilizes a powerful open source component called BuildKit to build Dockerfiles into images directly inside your Kubernetes cluster. When you build images, they are immediately available on the cluster for testing without requiring pushing to an external registry, providing an extremely efficient inner loop for development. The builder supports the two most popular container runtimes–containerd and dockerd–and will auto-detect the correct runtime in most cases. kubectl build -t myimage:latest -f Dockerfile ."
