title: 'Monoids, Monads, and Applicative Functors: Repeated Software Patterns'
language: English
recordingDate: 1635539725
description: "Forget factories, singletons, and proxies; What are the real patterns in software development? This talk explores abstract mathematical structures that commonly recur in software development. Once a mind is trained to recognize these patterns, it becomes easy to identify the fundamental operations for domain specific classes and how to put the pieces together. This discussion is for those who enjoy math, abstract concepts, and expanding their minds. \n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nCppCon Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish CppCon tech talks. \n\nCREDITS:\nCppCon YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/CppCon/videos"
