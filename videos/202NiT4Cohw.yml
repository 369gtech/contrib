recordingDate: 1486916826
description: 'Most frequently we are using words “testing” and “tester” when talk about product quality. But does testing or tester role affect quality? The eternal struggle between QC and QA… Yes, I’m almost sure you understand this, but why nothing is changed in most of teams? Because we need mind shift in our heads and more global changes in QA processes. Who QA engineers are and what are their responsibilities, activities, duties in modern development world? What options do they have to affect product quality and improve it if developers are responsible for product development? In this talk I will try to find detailed practical answers to all these questions. Let’s change development world together!'
