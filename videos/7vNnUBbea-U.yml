description: "In this talk Ben will go over a series of (surprising) observations backed by comprehensive data from the U.S. iTunes app store. He will present statistics and metrics that will help app sellers, marketers, and developers, understand recent dynamics in the U.S. app store. Along the way we'll uncover clues and strategies for boosting app downloads.
