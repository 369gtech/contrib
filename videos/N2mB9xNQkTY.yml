recordingDate: 1574262662
description: 'It seems like keeping up to date with Java nowadays can be a daunting task. Gone is the era of big, delayed Java releases that span years. We’re now getting a new major release every six months. What’s up with that? You’re probably still developing on Java 8, even though Java 13 is almost released already. Attend this session to get a code-first overview of what’s new in Java since Java 8. You’ll get an overview of the module system (Java 9), the local variable type inference feature (Java 10), and the new HttpClient API (Java 11), plus a sneak peek of Java 12 and 13 preview features. It’s time to embrace the newfound agility of the Java platform!'
