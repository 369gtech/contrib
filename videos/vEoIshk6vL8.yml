description: "Join the chat and ask questions live at https://aka.ms/LearnLiveTV\n\nStarting Monday, March 15, 2021 (PST), join Anna Hoffman and Bob Ward live on Learn TV and explore the six-part Microsoft Learn \"Azure SQL Fundamentals\" learning path. Each week, Anna and Bob will be walking through each module live and answering your questions. \n\nWhatever SLA, RTO, and RPO your business requires, Azure SQL has the options and built-in capabilities to meet that availability. In this module, you'll learn how to translate your knowledge of backup and restore, failover cluster instances, and Always On availability groups to the options for business continuity in Azure SQL. You'll also peek under the hood at the architectures and how they affect availability.\n\nAzure SQL Fundamentals: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/azure-sql-fundamentals/?WT.mc_id=learnlive-video-learn\n\nMiss an episode?
