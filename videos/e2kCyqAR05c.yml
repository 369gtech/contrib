description: "Filmed at https://2017.dotjs.io on December 1st in Paris. More talks on https://dotconferences.com/talks\n\nAccessibility can be a difficult and time consuming skillset to learn. User generated content is especially challenging to keep accessible for all.\n\nBy drawing inspiration from historic examples of 'guerilla accessibility', we can explore the use of technologies such as machine learning and script injection to improve the web for everyone.\n\nSuz gives both a technical and social commentary on how we often miss opportunities for new technology to improve others' lives, and how we can code ourselves out of a difficult box."
