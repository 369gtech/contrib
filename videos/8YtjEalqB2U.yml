description: "Are we ready to hand over our most personal information to a machine?\nHave we already done so and what might the consequences be further on?\nServices like Cortana, Alexa or Siri all want to be your new best friend. Your most trusted advisor.\nThese digital assistants and intelligent bots are built using state of the art machine learning apis that enables us to interact with them using natural language, imagery and sentiment-aware analysis. They learn by interacting with you.\n\nChannels like Messenger, Allo, Skype or Slack are swiftly becoming the first stop for information. The one stop for everything. Today these conversational canvases are wherever your users are, right then - right there. We're bridging the gaps of silence using platforms like Bot Framework that enables us to reach widely while maintaining focus on a single codebase.\n\nWhere is this new, always-available, interaction leading us?\n\nCome see what Conversations as a Platform can mean for your future interactions."
