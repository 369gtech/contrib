description: "\"Better than Free: How Value Is Generated in a Free Copy World\" \n\nKevin Kelly\n\nWired\n\nFor 25 years Kevin Kelly has been a participant in, and reporter on, the culture of technology. Based in his studio in Pacifica, California, he immerses himself in the long-term trends and social consequences of technology. Kevin Kelly is currently Senior Maverick at Wired magazine. He helped launch Wired in 1993, and served as its Executive Editor until January 1999. During Kelly's tenure as editor at Wired, the magazine won two National Magazine Awards (the industry's equivalent of two Oscars). He is currently editor and publisher of the popular Cool Tools, True Film, and Street Use websites. From 1984-1990 Kelly was publisher and editor of the Whole Earth Review, a journal of unorthodox technical news. He co-founded the ongoing Hackers' Conference, and was involved with the launch of the WELL, a pioneering online service started in 1985. A few years ago he started a scientific campaign to catalog all the living species of life on earth. This project has morphed into developing a web page for every species in an Encyclopedia of Life.\n\nKevin Kelly has authored the best-selling New Rules for the New Economy, and the classic book on decentralized emergent systems, Out of Control (called \"required reading for all executives\" by Fortune). In addition he writes for prominent publications including The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Economist, Time, Harpers, Science, GQ, and Esquire. Earlier in life he was a photographer in remote parts of Asia (instead of going to college), publishing his photographs in national magazines and recently in the photo art book Asia Grace. Currently he is a charter board member of the Long Now Foundation which is building a monumental clock that will tick for 10,000 years."
