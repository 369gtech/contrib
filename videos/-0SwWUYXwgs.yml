When you are using a CDN service like Limelight Orchestrate Performance to accelerate and optimize the delivery of your website or app, information about what behavior is affecting each individual request, and how the CDN is deciding what objects to return is important information to be able to gather, but can be hard to come by. In this session we look at how Limelight securely exposes data about CDN service and object delivery behavior, using HTTP headers.\n\nThis keynote is sponsored by Limelight Networks.\n\nAbout Steve Miller-Jones (Limelight Networks):\nSteve has worked in the streaming and content delivery networking (CDN) industry since 2008 and has a strong software project management and web-application programming background.
