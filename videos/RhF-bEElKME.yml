description: "Transformational Leadership and DevOps: Beyond the Research\n\nDr. Steve Mayner, SPCT and Senior Consultant, Scaled Agile, Inc. \n\nWhy do some Agile and DevOps transformations succeed while others fail? This is the fundamental question that led to groundbreaking research by Dr. Steve Mayner on transformational leadership and organizational change brought about by Agile and DevOps adoption. Transformational leaders communicate a clear inspirational vision, lead with integrity and authenticity, show genuine care and personal recognition for individuals, and empower their teams to look beyond the status quo to drive innovative solutions. Research shows that when leaders exhibit these behaviors it results in higher success rates for organizational change efforts and high performing teams.\n\nAt DOES 2016 in San Francisco, Dr. Mayner presented the findings of his research confirming the correlation between transformational leadership and successful organizational change in Agile and DevOps initiatives. Partnering with Gene Kim and IT Revolutions, he also shared the results of a research experiment illustrating that presenters at DOES conferences demonstrate strong transformational leadership behaviors. At DOES 2017 in London, Gene and the teams from DORA and Puppet announced that they had found in the 2017 State of DevOps Survey that high performing teams consistently had leaders who exhibited these same transformational behaviors, and these behaviors also strongly correlated with high employee Net Promoter Scores (NPS). \n\nOne of the most exciting findings from the research is that anyone can learn to become a transformational leader! In this DOES 2017 presentation, Dr. Mayner continues the conversation by sharing his experience developing a program to help leaders at all levels grow their transformational leadership competency. He will highlight the key components of the program as well as the implementation strategy that began with the C-suite of the company leading the way. Participants will receive practical tips for starting similar efforts in their own organizations, and will hear about opportunities to participate in future research and program development for transformational leadership training.\n\nDOES17 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
