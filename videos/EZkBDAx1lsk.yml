description: "RubyHACK 2018: 4 Programming Paradigms in 45 minutes by Aja Hammerly\n\nOverview of OO, Functional, Logical, and Procedural programming: Everything old is new again. Node developers are turning to functional techniques to handle concurrency challenges. Developers used to almost unlimited memory are having to learn techniques from assembly to handle the limited resources in IoT devices. Having a solid grounding in the different paradigms of programming and in several different languages makes it easier for developers to adapt as the “problem of the day changes”. It allows them to learn new programming languages faster. And this talk aims to cram the best of an 18 week college course on different parts of computing into 45 minutes."
