title: 'Journey’s End: Collection and Reduction in the Stream API'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433260459
description: "For streams to do useful work, they must end in a terminal operation. Most often that will be a collector, a new kind of operation invented for the Stream API. To use streams effectively, you need to understand how collectors work, what predefined collectors are available, and the factors that affect collector performance. In this deep dive into the Collectors API, you’ll learn about the many predefined collectors and how to combine them for added power. You’ll do practical work in this tutorial, learning how to choose the right composition of collectors to solve practical programming problems. And you’ll also find out about the difference between collection and reduction, how to recognize when you need to write your own collector, and the principles and rules for doing that.\n\n\nAuthor:\n Maurice Naftalin\nMaurice Naftalin is principal developer at Morningside Light Ltd.
