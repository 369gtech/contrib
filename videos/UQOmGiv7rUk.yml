title: 'Surviving Your Inevitable Agile Transition - J.B. Rainsberger'
recordingDate: 1411497277
description: "Agile transitions are everywhere. Even if your company isn’t going through one now, there’s a good chance that sometime in the next few years an agile transition will affect you. This doesn’t have to be bad news, but I can virtually guarantee that it will create chaos and confusion. Wouldn’t it be nice to survive all that?\nIn this short talk I will highlight a few important points about agile software development, which will help you find your way through the transition. These fundamental ideas can help you avoid exhausting, pointless arguments with your colleagues and bosses. Some of them might even help you find an oasis of calm productivity in the middle of the storm.\n\nIf, by chance, your company is considering a “transition to agile”, and if, by chance, you can influence some key decision-makers, these ideas can help avoid considerable headache and heartache. Maybe. We’ll try."
