title: 'YOW! 2012 Brian Beckman - Term-Rewriting in JavaScript for Fun and World Domination'
recordingDate: 1503838426
description: "Two tasks of increasing importance in distributed computing are:\n\n(1)    robustly tracking units of measure, such as weights, distances, energy, monetary currencies\n(2)    reasoning over data, such as answering symbolic queries\n\nThese tasks are arduous using ordinary programming techniques, requiring various specialized symbolic frameworks, say one for units conversion and another for pattern-matching and unification. Term rewriting is an established, alternative computing discipline that naturally addresses such problems. We show a surprisingly small conditional term rewriting engine embedded in JavaScript that supports remotable expression evaluation in browsers and servers, persistence in mongodb, and authoring in Mathematica. We illustrate with scenarios ranging from calorie counting to market alerts to sports analytics, all expressed in surprisingly short scripts empowered by pattern-matching and replacement rules.\n\nBrian Beckman wrote foundational software for new starts in Bing Mobile Mapping and Technology platform. Created pure-functional language and runtime using combined numeric and symbolic processing for business intelligence and visualization. Co-Found Tesla and Volta efforts with Erik Meijer via LINQ and the Reactive Framework. Approximately 85 patent filings and 25 issued patents. Consultant for Tire Physics on XBox racing game “Forza”. * Designed and coded all physics for secret video-game project based on my “Physics of Racing” papers. Co-Founded Biztalk effort with Greg Meredith and Marc Levy. Greg and I wrote the original Biztalk workflow engine, which became Windows orchestration framework. Early architecture and coding for .NET code-access security (pre-1.0) Design and Coding for Microsoft Transaction Server role-based security architecture, including back-port of Windows NT DCOM security to Windows 95. Prototyped secret kernel-based sandboxing of downloaded code in the NT kernel using Scheme in kernel mode. Solo: Hostile Foreign-Function Interface for Scheme, allowing any native-mode Windows DLL to be loaded into the scheme runtime. With Barbara Fox, established Microsoft Crypto group and all Microsoft’s public-key security efforts. Research and architecture for post-link profile-driven code rewriting. Principal Architect for version 1 of the Time Warp Operating System, with David Jefferson et al. ~20 publications and awards. Relativistic corrections to GPS interferometry for direct measurement of Continental Drift. Water-Vapor Radiometry for GPS and Astronomical interferometry for direct measurement of Continental Drift (under the Geodynamics Program at JPL). Many software innovations, including improved integration routines, simulation architectures, special-purpose retargetable editors, embedded scripting, etc. Software Passion: Mixed symbolic and numeric computing.\n\nFor more on YOW!
