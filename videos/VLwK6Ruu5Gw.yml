description: "2015 State of the Software Supply Chain: DevOps and the Illusion of Control\n\nDerek E. Weeks, Sonatype\n\nThis year, I authored the 2015 State of the Software Supply Chain Report - a quantitative analysis of 160,000 software development organizations that consumed 17 billion open source and proprietary software components from over 100,000 projects. While the average organization consumed 240,000 components in 2014, the study revealed evidence of inefficient software sourcing practices, building in outdated components, and using software with known security vulnerabilities or potentially risky license types by mistake. Attendees will learn how leading organizations are applying proven supply chain principles from the manufacturing industry toward improving their DevOps and Continuous Delivery practices.\n\nView the full LISA15 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa15/conference-program"
