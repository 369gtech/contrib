description: "In modern Web applications, the complexity of code deployed to the browser now exceeds the complexity of server-side code. Why write the simpler tier in toolable, typesafe languages but throw the constantly evolving user interface layer to the JavaScript wolves? Through compile-time source code translation, the Errai framework brings mature, proven, toolable Java enterprise programming models to the browser so your team can pole-vault over the complexity wall. In this session, members of the Errai team demonstrate how to build rich Web applications the toolable, typesafe way, without boilerplate. Errai offers a concise programming model to build next-generation Web applications by combining the best aspects of JavaScript and Java.\n\n\nAuthors:\nJonathan Fuerth\nundefined\nView more trainings by Jonathan Fuerth at https://www.parleys.com/author/jonathan-fuerth\n\nChristian Sadilek\nChristian Sadilek is a Senior Software Engineer at JBoss by Red Hat, and a core developer of the Errai framework.
