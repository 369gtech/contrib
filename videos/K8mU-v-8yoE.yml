description: "IT Leadership: What does it mean to deliver business value?\n\nMark Schwartz, Author of The Art of Business Value & CIO\n\nDo you really understand what business value is? Information technology can and should deliver business value. But the IT community - and in particular the Agile community, which makes a point of organizing all its efforts around the delivery of business value - has paid scant attention to what exactly business value means—and how to know whether or not you are delivering it. This problem becomes ever more critical as you push value delivery toward autonomous teams and away from requirements “tossed over the wall” by business stakeholders. An empowered team needs to understand its goal! \n\nThe author of The Art of Business Value and an experienced CIO in organizations large and small, Mark Schwartz will take you on a playful and thought-provoking journey that explores just what business value means, why it matters, and how it should affect your software development and IT delivery practices. Mark will make you think deeply about not only what it means to deliver value but also the role of the CIO and the relationship of the IT organization to the rest of the enterprise.\n\nDOES16 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
