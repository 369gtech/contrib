description: "Scott Bragg, Ben Short\nhttp://linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/184/\nAmateur radio and open source software have a long history together but there is plenty of room to bring them closer together. What can (the institutions of amatuer radio) learn from the open source community and development? What can open source groups learn from amateur radio groups?\r\n\r\nThe panel will also aim to discuss current technologies and the inevitable lag of regulation, as well as roadmaps of your favourite projects. We're not above accidentally inserting an ad-hoc lightning talk in the mix. \r\n\r\nOur hosts will put together a panel of amateur radio operators, developers and makers to discuss these but also with some audience participation.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to appear on the panel, or want a few minutes for a radio related lightning talk, send us an email to [jsbragg@scriptforge.org](mailto:jsbragg@scriptforge.org) and tell us about yourself."
