title: 'Just in Time Compiler'
recordingDate: 1375271447
description: 'The JIT compiles MSIL (sometimes called CIL) into native instructions at runtime. The JITter converts code method-by-method as they are called. After the JIT has compiled a method, as long as there is enough memory to keep the code around, the JIT compiler is no longer needed.'
