title: 'GoWayFest 2017 - Maxim Kurtiianov - Business Logic Verification In Go Applications Using Contexts'
recordingDate: 1503405957
description: "Concurrency primitives are first class citizens of the Go language and any sufficiently complex project would use them in many places to create a concurrent flow. When you start a HTTP server in Go program, e.g. using http.ListenAndServe, it will implicitly handle incoming requests in separate goroutines, creating a lot of parallel branches of execution. It's a common practice to have tens of thousands goroutines spawned and processing requests simultaneously. \nAs a result, the business logic becomes blurried away, it's being obscured by a complex dynamic system with lots of concurrent processes, which may have stochastic effects, making the flow of execution hardly understandable. But it's important to have ability to understand, audit and verify business logic flow in such applications. \nThis talk explains the purpose and typical use cases for Go contexts, and presents an approach for business logic verification in your applications that leverages contexts to capture the execution flow for further analysis."
