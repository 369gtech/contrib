recordingDate: 1579154451
description: "Arjen Lentz\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/230/\n\nTechnology is useful, but it's a tool (a means to achieve goals), not a goal in itself.\r\nOur mis-use of tech is sabotaging many aspects of society, but education especially so.\r\nIn this short talk, Arjen will plead a comprehensive case, presenting evidence on where the key culprits are.\r\n\r\nAfter hearing the evidence, what will be your judgement?\r\nKnowing and understanding what we're dealing with, may help us to help educators.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n#linux.conf.au #linux #foss #opensource\n\nMon Jan 13 16:25:00 2020 at Room 9"
