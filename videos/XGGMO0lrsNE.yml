description: 'One of the most important community-driven plugins in the NetBeans ecosystem is support for Gradle. This presentation shows the current state of support for Gradle, including advanced features such as code coverage and debugging. Besides an overview of long-standing features, it includes a sneak peek into the upcoming enhancements, such as support for new Gradle concepts to support JDK 9 modularity as well as long-awaited enhancements to Gradle code completion in NetBeans. The second part of the session focuses on building NetBeans IDE extensions (plugins) with Gradle and how to use Gradle to build your own rich client platform application based on the NetBeans platform.'
