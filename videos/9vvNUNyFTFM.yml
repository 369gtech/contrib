description: "Subscribe to our channel: https://youtube.pl/c/DevoxxPoland?sub_confirmation=1\n\nCoroutines is a new feature in Kotlin 1.1. It allows for writing an asynchronous code almost just like if it was regular/synchronous. This makes coroutines a great alternative to existing approaches for writing asynchronous applications.\n\nIn this session, I'll show how coroutines work in Kotlin. You'll learn about new syntax and implementation details. You'll find out about the differences between coroutines-based and reactive-based solutions. You'll also see a sample Spring-based application which uses coroutines.\n#Kotlin #Coroutines #AsynchronousProgramming\n\nPresented by Konrad Kamiński\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DevoxxPL\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/grzegorz.duda.official/\n\nJoin us also here:\nTechnology Radar Review: https://dworld.pl/radar\nDevelopers World Academy: https://dworld.pl/akademia\nDevflix: https://devflix.pl\n\n#Devoxx #DevoxxPoland #IT #Development #SoftwareDevelopment"
