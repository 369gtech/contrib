Last weekend he sailed the 235-mile Mackinac race and got a nasty sunburn. He loves to cruise around Detroit on his bicycle, Sparky. Brian also plays sub-par defense for the Downtown FC soccer team. He is vice president of products for Palo Alto-based startup Apigee. He has a physics degree from University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. He also needs a haircut.\n\nOpening graphic and video produced by LCC-TV.\nVideos edited by Nick Kwiatkowski."
