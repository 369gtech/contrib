language: English
recordingDate: 1628613305
description: "Microservices encourages loosely coupled and highly cohesive architecture. Coupling refers to the degree of interdependence between software modules and cohesion indicates how well the individual elements within an application work together. This has gained popularity as it helps Enterprise applications easier to develop, build, deploy, test and scale.\n\nThis session will talk about legacy monolithic applications, their shortcomings, and how microservices architecture solves these problems. This is an important concept to understand for anyone who is involved in the design, development, deployment or testing of any computer software system. This session will use human relationship analogies to explain how the same principles apply to microservices architecture to make the concepts easier and fun to understand.\n\nInterested in learning more?
