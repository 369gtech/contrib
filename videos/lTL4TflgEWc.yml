description: "This video was recorded at Scala Days Copenhagen 2017\nFollow us on Twitter @ScalaDays or visit our website for more information http://scaladays.org \n\nAbstract: \nAt any company’s start, they will face of the decision of which programming language will define their technology stack. For Tapad, this was in 2010, when languages like Scala were in their very early stages and many engineers weren’t looking beyond Java. It was at that time that CTO and co-founder, Dag Liodden, made the decision to use Scala, which arguably provided the technical foundation needed to scale Tapad to what it is today -- a 200+ person company, managing 20+ PB of data, that was recently acquired for $360 million. While adoption has gained significant momentum for Scala since Tapad first embraced the language, it is still in the fairly early stages of maturity, which poses challenges for experienced and novice Scala developer teams alike. In this session, Dag will address the source of some of these challenges, how they can be resolved, and how Scala can help deliver high quality code at high velocity. Ultimately, all leading up to how engineers and entrepreneurs alike can overcome these barriers to build a team, or even a whole company, on Scala."
