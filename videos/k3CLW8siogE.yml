The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nKeynote: Enabling World Class Engineering with Kubernetes at Xero - Jono Cooper, Engineer, Xero \n\nXero is Australia's largest business platform, helping millions of Australian small businesses thrive. We recently started our journey with Kubernetes, Helm, Open Policy Agent, and more to empower our 1200 developers. This is a major challenge, as Xero has many self-organising teams, each with different tooling and compute platforms.\n\nIn this talk, we will discuss how Xero built a new cloud native platform that serves over a million Australian customers. Learn how we optimized the developer experience with Kubernetes and Helm, to improve the velocity of our product teams and enable them to focus on building beautiful products. We will share the quick wins, challenges faced, and how we started a large migration of legacy services without an overwhelming support workload."
