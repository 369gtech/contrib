Some researchers claim that within a few decades we will reach a so-called singularity in which computer intelligence will surpass human capabilities in all domains. Other AI-researchers, however, maintain that we have still far from understood the human ability to reach fast, intuitive and correct decisions based on often seemingly too little data. They believe that the future job market will rely heavily on such insights in developing hybrid forms of human-machine intelligence.\nIn the scienceathome.org project, we have developed games allowing so far 250,000 players to contribute to research in quantum and classical physics, mathematics, chemistry, behavioral economics, corporate management, psychology and cognitive science. We believe that this wealth of data from human individual and collective problem solving holds the key to understanding and further exploiting human uniqueness.\nApart from AI, the digital 21st century also poses a democratic challenge [...]\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotocph.com/2018/sessions/606\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocph\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttp://gotocon.com\n#AI #ML #ArtificialIntelligence #MachineLearning"
