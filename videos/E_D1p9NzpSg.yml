description: 'We think we’re clever. Especially us engineers. Rational, rather than emotional. Straight forward (something to be proud of!) and clear headed. We take a problem, look at it from all sides and solve it. Do we? Are we? We are human beings and – like all human beings, we are limited to what our highly evolved, yet still apish brains offer us. And as everything looks like a nail to a hammer, our brains tend to blind us to their limitations. DevOps Pro Vilnius 2016 - http://goo.gl/D9eDT7'
