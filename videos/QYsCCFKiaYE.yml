In contrast to Hadoop's two-stage disk-based MapReduce paradigm, Spark's in-memory primitives provide performance up to 100 times faster for certain applications.\n\nScala is a general-purpose programming language, which expresses the programming patterns in a concise, elegant, and type-safe way. \n\nIt is basically an acronym for “Scalable Language”. Scala is an easy-to-learn language and supports both Object Oriented Programming as well as Functional \nProgramming.\nwatch this video to know more about Apche Spark and Scala.\n\n\nRelated Blogs:\nhttp://www.edureka.co/blog/apache-spark-with-hadoop-why-it-matters/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=spark-scala2\n\nhttp://www.edureka.co/blog/why-scala-is-getting-popular/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=spark-scala2\n\nhttp://www.edureka.co/blog/5-reasons-to-learn-apache-spark/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=spark-scala2\n\nhttp://www.edureka.co/blog/what_is_scala/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=spark-scala2\n\nEdureka is a New Age e-learning platform that provides Instructor-Led Live, Online classes for learners who would prefer a hassle free and self paced learning \nenvironment, accessible from any part of the world.\n\nThe topics related to  'Apache Spark and Scala’ have been widely covered in our course ‘Apache Spark & Scala’.\nFor more information, please write back to us at sales@edureka.co\nCall us at US: 1800 275 9730 (toll free) or India: +91-8880862004"
