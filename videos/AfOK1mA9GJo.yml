description: "Kurt Andersen, LinkedIn\n\nAbstract: \nAcross a distributed, mostly embedded SRE organization we knew that some teams were being hit harder by toil and especially on-call response load, but how do you quantify that in order to identify contributing factors and improve quality of life for everyone? I'll talk about a series of strategies that we have used separately and in combination over the course of several years to surface some indications of the human load impact. While some of the systems use internal terminology, the processes can be used by any organization that is interested and willing to see what the data might reveal—they just need any local jargon translated to your local dialect.\n\nThe talk will include the specific surveys and other tooling that we have experimented with over the last three years as well as what we have learned along the way.\n\nView the full LISA18 Program at https://www.usenix.org/lisa18/conference-program"
