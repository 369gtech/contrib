description: "CF “Holiday” Push – How DSG Onboarded Over 40 Teams in Seven Months - Nick Belhumeur, Dick's Sporting Goods & Sameer Hashmi, Pivotal\n\nSeven Engineers with zero PCF experience.\nSeven months to prepare for the three biggest shopping days of the year.\nOne goal…survive!!!\n\nIn early 2018, Dick’s Sporting Goods (DSG) began their journey along-side Pivotal using PCF with the single goal to improve athletes’ (customers’) experiences in all aspects of the business. This meant enabling teammates (associates) with tools to put their services and solutions in front of end-users faster to make an immediate and positive impact on the customer experience.\n\nThe DSG Platform Team was formed and within one month successfully deployed (manually) the first foundation. Two weeks later the process was fully automated, and a production-ready foundation was built. This pace was maintained over the next several months as 40+ product teams were onboarded, microservices were being deployed faster than ever before, and teams raced toward the finish line to be prepared for the holiday shopping season. This is the story of Dick’s Sporting Goods and the team behind the teams that built a foundation for the future.\n\nAbout Nick Belhumeur\nNick Belhumeur is a Platform Reliability Engineer at Dick’s Sporting Goods where he is responsible for managing and supporting the PCF environments and toolsets that enable product teams to develop their best solutions.

He lives in Pittsburgh, PA and enjoys spending time with his wife and daughter, playing hockey, and golfing any chance he gets.\n\nAbout Sameer Hashmi\nSameer Hashmi is a Senior Platform Architect at Pivotal.
