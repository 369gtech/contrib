title: 'USENIX ATC ''15 - Surviving Peripheral Failures in Embedded Systems'
language: English
recordingDate: 1638400909
description: "Surviving Peripheral Failures in Embedded Systems\n\nRebecca Smith and Scott Rixner, Rice University\n\nPeripherals fail. Yet, modern embedded systems largely leave the burden of tolerating peripheral failures to the programmer. This paper presents Phoenix, a semi-automated peripheral recovery system for resource-constrained embedded systems. Phoenix introduces lightweight checkpointing mechanisms that transparently track both the internal program state and the external peripheral state. These mechanisms enable rollback to the precise point at which any failed peripheral access occurred using as little as 6 KB of memory, minimizing both recovery latency and memory utilization.\n\nView the full USENIX ATC '15 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc15/technical-sessions"
