title: '[JSConfUS 2013] Adam Baldwin: Builders vs Breakers'
recordingDate: 1381852533
description: "A internal civil war has been my life for years as I've walked the razor wire separating breakers and builders.\n\nI'd like to share my experiences presenting outside the security industry at developer conferences like Djangocon, JSConf (trackb), and RealtimeConf what it's like to be the lone security professional in a sea of builders, what it feels like, what they say, what they really care about, how not to speak to them, how to completely disrespect them, and how to fail miserably."
