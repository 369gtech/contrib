title: 'Capitalizing on a Great IDEA: Becoming a super user with IntelliJ - Maxim Novak (Hebrew)'
recordingDate: 1514200120
description: "IntelliJ IDEA is the best IDE Maxim claims to have ever worked with, partially because it has so many features that allow us to boost productivity in our every-day job; features, that many developers just don’t use.\n\nIn this talk, Maxim gives you the tools to become a super-user, do the same things only faster and easier. He showcases live-coding use-cases to cover, among other tips, useful shortcuts, easier editing, navigation, and refactoring.\n\nMaxim is full of enthusiasm for innovation, and passionate about technology. He’s been in the R&D field for 9 years and his experience includes developing, designing, and leading large-scale software projects.\n\nHe currently works on core back-end projects that empower Wix’s platform to serve over 90 million sites with over 200 micro-services.\n\nJava.IL - the Israeli Java Community:\nhttps://www.meetup.com/JavaIL\n\nHosted by Wix.com"
