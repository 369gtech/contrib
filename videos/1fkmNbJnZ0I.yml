language: English
recordingDate: 1545235200
description: 'Charles is the co-founder of Snipcart, a custom e-commerce service for developers which recently went through a rewrite. In the talk Charles demonstrates a wonderful use-case for creating a custom rendering function for Vue, which allows developers using the Snipcart service to easily insert inject template code where needed. They also created Microcomponents to encapsulate UI logic and integrated Vue and Redux together.'
