description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTOpia November 2020. #GOTOcon #GOTOpia\nhttp://gotopia.eu\n\nRobin Moffatt - Senior Developer Advocate at Confluent\n\nABSTRACT\nImagine you’ve got a stream of data; it’s not “big data,” but it’s certainly a lot. Within the data, you’ve got some bits you’re interested in, and of those bits, you’d like to be able to query information about them at any point. Sounds fun, right? Since I mentioned “querying,” I’d hazard a guess that you’ve got in mind an additional datastore of some sort, whether relational or NoSQL.\nBut what if I told you…that you didn’t need any datastore other than Kafka itself? What if you could ingest, filter, enrich, aggregate, and query data with just Kafka? With ksqlDB we can do just this, and I want to show you exactly how.\nIn this hands-on talk, we’ll walk through an example of building a Telegram bot in which ksqlDB provides the key/value lookups driven by a materialised view on the stream of events in Kafka. We’ll take a look at what ksqlDB is and its capabilities for processing data [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n01:07 Where's my nearest carpark with available spaces?\n02:46 Demo\n30:23 What are the key pieces of the design?\n35:45 Why build it this way?\n36:51 Outro\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotopia.eu/november-2020/sessions/1651/%9F%A4%96-building-a-telegram-bot-with-apache-kafka-go-and-ksqldb\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#ApacheKafka #GoLang #ksqlDB #LiveCoding #Demo #Elasticsearch #Kibana #Elastic #EventDriven #Streaming #EventStreams #Telegram\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
