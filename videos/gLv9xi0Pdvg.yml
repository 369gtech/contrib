description: "We hear from Codurance co-founder Sandro Mancuso at SC London 2019. He provides a reflection on his session at the conference and the future of the Software Craftsmanship movement.  \n\nSoftware Craftsmanship is growing, the message is being spread, and more communities are developing. There are some great things coming out of this. The mindset: more developers are becoming aware of the mindset and becoming more passionate about their craft. \n\nIn the future, Sandro would like to see an evolution of technical practices, today we are still very attached to Extreme Programming practices. These practices have been around for over 20 years. Sandro would also like to see the Software Craftspeople focusing more on the business. At the moment they are very focused on the technical aspect and lack the ability to bring that expertise to the business.\n\nFor more information on SC London or to find out how you can participate, please visit https://sc-london.com/.\n\nRelated Content:\nOpening Session - Aligning Product and Software Design: https://youtu.be/PGsW9qFb-_M"
