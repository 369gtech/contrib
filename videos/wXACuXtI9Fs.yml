language: ""
recordingDate: 1423609428
description: "Speaker: Cédric Champeau\nMore Groovy Track\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/traits-design\nGroovy 2.3 introduces the concept of traits in the language. Traits look like interfaces, but allow the developer to add both implementation and state into it. It introduces multiple inheritance in the language while avoiding the diamond problem. Traits will let you rethink the way you design\nAPIs in Groovy, by favoriting composition of behaviors."
