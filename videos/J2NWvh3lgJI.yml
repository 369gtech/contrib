description: "Monitoring Service Architecture and Health with BPF - Jonathan Perry, Flowmill, Inc. \n\nKubernetes has made it incredibly easy to build distributed applications out of large numbers of microservices. Monitoring, or even accurately tracking, the interaction between each of these services can be a significant operational challenge.     In this talk, we will explain how you can get 100% visibility into the flow of data between services in your Kubernetes cluster using BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter). We will first discuss how flow data can help you monitor service architecture and assess the health of microservices. Next we will focus on how you can use BPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) to extract flow data without any changes to application code, aggregate it across pods, services, and namespaces, and analyze it with Prometheus. Finally, we will show this in action in our production cluster, and discuss some of challenges that emerge as you roll it out at scale. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPbs"
