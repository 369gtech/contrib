description: "Benchmarks are one of the best ways to start zealot wars, feed trolls and take bad decisions. Yet, a lot of mistakes can be made, without even realizing it.\n\nIn this session, we will discuss the important metrics to measure, why they are important, we will analyse whether we should measure an average latency, and finally we will explain what the Coordinated Omission issue is."
