description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM STO 19 http://bit.ly/2W2vgDC\n\nGet involved in Code Sync's next conference http://bit.ly/2Mcm4aS\n\n---\n\nBEAM + RUST: A MATCH MADE IN HEAVEN\nby Sonny Scroggin\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nInteroperability \nPerformance \nRust\n\nTALK LEVEL: Advanced\n\nABSTRACT\nThe BEAM is well-known for its fault-tolerant properties. It's quite performant and memory efficient for many use-cases. But occasionally we find ourselves hitting the limits of what the BEAM can provide us. What happens when we need to interface directly with hardware? Or when a specific part of our application needs to be as fast as possible?.\n\nIn this talk, Sonny will introduce you to Rust - a systems programming language that aims to empower everyone to build reliable and efficient software and the various methods we can use to integrate with it from the BEAM.\n\nRead the full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/sonny-scroggin/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - SONNY SCROGGIN\nIn pursuit of beautiful abstractions\n\nSonny Scroggin is an experienced software engineer with broad interests in the world of computing. He is best known for his contributions to the Phoenix Framework and other supporting libraries within the Elixir ecosystem. You can find him presenting or teaching others about Elixir, Phoenix, and other tools and libraries in the local user groups in Nashville, TN and at conferences around the world.\n\nMore on Sonny Scroggin: https://codesync.global/speaker/sonny-scroggin/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM STO 19\nCode BEAM STO is powered by Code Sync.
