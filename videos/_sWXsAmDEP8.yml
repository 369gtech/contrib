title: 'Cracking the code: neuronal networks in the brain | Sabria Lagoun'
recordingDate: 1545384064
description: "If the first artificial neurons were inspired by the brain, A.I soon diverged to become a discipline on its own. However, evolution produced performant, ultra-light, energy-effective biological neuronal networks. Insects and worms only possess a few hundred neurons, but they are able to navigate, make decisions, adapt their behavior and communicate. Through cutting edge techniques, we are now able to explore these natural networks in vivo, during the execution of extremely demanding cognitive tasks. I will describe fantastic encoding solutions that emerged from the brainsâ€™ biophysical constraints. I will give examples of bio-inspired A.I. algorithms for learning and spatial navigation, and explain how artificial neuronal networks can spontaneously show a behavior identical to the live brain.\n\nVisit the largest developer playground in Europe!\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/wearedevelopers\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/WeAreDevs\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/_wearedevelopers/\n\n#WeAreDevs"
