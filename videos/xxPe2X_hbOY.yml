title: 'DEF CON Safe Mode Red Team Village - Walter Cuestas - Initial Compromise Through Web Side'
language: English
recordingDate: 1597890500
description: "Initial compromise seems to be tied to client side, but, there are several attack vectors on Web side besides a simple RCE.\nDuring this talk I will show 3 cases of getting the initial compromise through vulnerabilities found in application servers and thin clients services going from breaking authentication process, escaping controls and how to solve some challenges during exploitation of what seems an easy peasy. Objectives of this talk are : show how important is to make a good OSINT, make a good dictionary, manage escape sequences in thin client services, how to modify already developed exploits for our current target and the benefit for blue teams to have applications security integrated with infrastructure/operations security."
