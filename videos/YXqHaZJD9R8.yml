description: "Rockstar Night: Object-Oriented Java Web Framework from Scratch\nObject-Oriented Java Web Framework From Scratch (Yegor Bugayenko - founder and CEO of Zerocracy)\nMost or all Java web frameworks have very similar principles inside, which make them very easy to use at the beginning, but fall apart when things get more complicated. At the meetup we will make an attempt to create a new framework with different principles in mind, meaning better object-orientation, better encapsulation, and abstraction."
