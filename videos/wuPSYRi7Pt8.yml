description: "Types can help you understand and document your code. When was the last time you saw JavaScript documentation that didnâ€™t mention the *types* for function arguments / return values?\n\nWhy have this information separated from the implementation? Type information is awesome if you think about it: A single type annotation for a function is a theorem and the function body is the proof. And now you can have type annotations for your JavaScript. Introducing TypeScript. It adds Types and brings in ES6/ES7 features.TypeScript feels like and compiles to JavaScript, Any browser. Any host. Any OS. Open Source. This session will take a JavaScript expert and convert them into a TypeScript expert. What's new from ES-next and how do existing JavaScript libraries interplay in this typed landscape."
