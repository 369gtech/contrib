title: 'On Micro Services and Iterative Development: Deferring Implementation With Chains of Responsibility'
recordingDate: 1553351023
description: "We operate in a whirlwind of MVPs, pivoting and welcoming change. Iterative development, continuous integration and DevOps have not only enabled this movement but made it a productive, fun place in which to work. Architecturally, micro services are contributing to delivering loosely-coupled functionality on-demand. The Chain of Responsibility is a simple design pattern that you may find particularly useful in extending your services over time, in a sustainable, testable manner without breaking backwards compatibility and without needing Mystic Meg levels of foresight or planning.\n\nThis talk, aimed at coders with some architectural autonomy or influence, will show you one way to grow your service from bare bones to add responsibilities like validation and caching as non-invasive after-thoughts, all the way obeying SOLID principles.\n\nDemo code is in c# but the patterns are equally applicable in other languages."
