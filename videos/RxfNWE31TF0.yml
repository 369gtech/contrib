description: "Robotic Process Automation - Past, Present and Future\nRPA had been a buzzword amongst business people for a few years but, what does it actually mean for developers? Is it beneath us or beyond us? I’ll be talking about where automation has come from and its evolution into the current context. I’ll look in to each of the main Vednors within RPA and present the pros and cons of each. I’ll conclude with an insight into the future, taking into account the increasing implementation of ‘AI’ and cognitive robotics."
