description: "Talk recording from Amsterdam JSNation Conference 2019 https://jsnation.com\n\n# The working Architecture of Node.js Applications\n\nI've seen a lot of NodeJs applications. I see a lot of misunderstandings around architectural patterns. 99% of NodeJS tutorials do not cover this topic and limited to \"hello world\" apps. How to build a really large application? How to think about architectural layers? What is wrong with the majority of JS frameworks? How does GraphQL influence my architecture? I will answer all of these questions."
