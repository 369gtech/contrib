description: "Everybody and their dog seems to have a startup these days. Thanks to titles such as  The Lean Startup,  there is a race for teams to  iterate, add value, have sprints, and do devops!  For the vast majority of startups, this means a race to WAT, a pileup of technology and business practices that turn the startup into a car crash disaster of tears and recriminations. Over the past 18 months, the Diabolical Developer and the Voice of Reason have been masquerading as founders of jClarity as well as acting as advisors to the London startup scene (a.k.a. Silicon Roundabout). In this session, they unveil the truth; showcase several WATs; and, most importantly, tell you what not to do, from bitter firsthand, secondhand, and thirdhand experience.\n\n\nAuthors:\nMartijn Verburg\nMartijn Verburg (aka 'the Diabolical Developer') herds Cats in the Java/open source communities and is constantly humbled by the creative power to be found there. Currently he resides in London where he co-leads the London JUG (a JCP EC member), runs a couple of open source projects & drinks too much beer at his local pub. You can find him online moderating at the Javaranch or discussing (ranting?) subjects on the Programmers Stack Exchange site. Most recently he's become a regular speaker at conferences on Java, open source and software development and has recently wrapped up his first Manning title - \"The Well-Grounded Java Developer\" with his co-author Ben Evans.\nView more trainings by Martijn Verburg at https://www.parleys.com/author/martijn-verburg\n\nBen Evans\nBen Evans has lived in \"Interesting Times\" in technology - he was the lead performance testing engineer for the Google IPO, worked on the initial UK trials of 3G networks with BT, built award-winning websites for some of Hollywood's biggest hits of the 90s, rearchitected and reimagined technology helping some of the most vulnerable people in the UK and has worked on everything from some of the UKs very first ecommerce sites, through to multi-billion dollar currency trading systems.\nHe helps to run the London Java Community, and represents the JUG on the Java SE/EE Executive Committee.
