title: 'DrupalCon Vienna 2017: Drupal 8 Front-End: Theming vs. Configuration Conundrums'
recordingDate: 1506593008
description: "In Drupal 8, we have a very flexible theming system that allows you\_to override the front-end output of your site. At the same time, we have site building techniques and modules that give us lots of flexibility over the display of content, forms, navigation, Views, webforms, layouts and other components. Sometimes, it’s easy to know when site building stops and theming begins, but other times we have to decide which approach is the best.\n\nIn this session, we'll walk through a number of the tough choices you might face as a themer/site builder. Should I use view modes or configure the fields in views? Should I display an image using an image tag or a background image? Should I use\_a custom formatter or override a theme template? We’ll discuss how to decide which approach makes the most sense given your requirements and your project workflow.\n\nHere are some example of the conundrums we'll discuss:\n\nUsing view modes vs. fields\nOverriding HTML output in Views config vs. overriding a template\nUsing a view with a contextual filter vs. theming a field\nAdding background images through CSS vs. displaying\_image tags\nCreating regions\_vs. theming individual blocks\nConfiguring\_a layout plugin vs. using a template\nUsing a slideshow or overlay module\_vs. theming it yourself\nConfiguring vs. theming the output of webforms\nThis talk is designed for themers and site builders who are familiar with Drupal and want learn new techniques and best practices."
