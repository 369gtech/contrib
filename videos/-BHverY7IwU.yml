description: "\"Speaker: Thea Flowers\n\nFind yourself doing the same thing over and over again? Does it take more than one command to run your tests? build your docs? publish your project? deploy?\n\nIt is often difficult to share your code because others can run or test it? Does your README have a series of complicated steps to get things set up?\n\nThis talk explores three open-source tools that are wonderful at helping you and your project automate tasks. We'll look at Tox, which specializes in Python test environments, Nox, which offers a slightly different approach, and finally, PyInvoke, which you can use to automate just about anything.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2019 and https://github.com/PyCon/2019-slides\""
