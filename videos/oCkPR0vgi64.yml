description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nA GitOps approach to Zero Touch Provisioning for the 5G vRAN Edge - Ian Jolliffe & Yolanda Robla Mota, Red Hat\n\nTraditional approaches for deploying software at the Edge don’t scale. For example, consider the effort to deploy thousands of nodes at the Edge of the network for 5G vRAN DU’s at the base of cell towers, we need a new approach. Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) and declarative frameworks can be leveraged to drive down OPEX and deploy software in parallel to multiple sites, with no human intervention. The declarative framework leverages many open source projects including Ansible, Kustomize, OpenShift, and Open Cluster Management. This is a diverse environment, using declarative frameworks, we can define the infrastructure as code and manage it via GitOps methodologies. These approaches are required so that the operator can bring a diverse ecosystem together to address their business problems at scale."
