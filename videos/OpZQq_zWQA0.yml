description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nCloud-Agnostic Design for Fun and Profit - Alex Meijer & Anusha Iyer, Corsha, Inc.\n\nThere is now sufficient competition in the cloud computing space that all the major cloud providers are competing directly on pricing. Like any other market, there are significant opportunities for savings if an organization is willing to periodically switch to more competitive service providers. However, the engineering cost of a cloud provider migration typically negates those savings – but that doesn't have to be the case. This talk will cover a two-year journey spanning several cloud providers, and how to avoid vendor lock-in by making cloud agnostic design a first-class consideration. A case study will be provided on how embracing open source projects like Kubernetes, Terraform, and Helm permitted lightning-fast migration to and from cloud providers driven by economic incentives. The high level details of Corsha's Infrastructure-as-code strategy will be discussed, and how an early commitment to this approach has resulted in flexible and efficient cloud native app deployments."
