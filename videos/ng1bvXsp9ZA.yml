title: '"An introduction to Penetration Testing using Kali Linux" - Marcus Herstik (LCA 2020)'
recordingDate: 1579222138
description: "Marcus Herstik\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/67/\n\nFor those who have always wanted to know a little about hacking this is an introduction to some of the tools available in Kali Linux and how you can use it to check your network for security flaws (aka vulnerabilities). As an introduction to pen-testing, this is designed for novices who are interested in the Cyber Kill Chain, how to test common systems and those wanting to know how to get started, rather than just watching videos. As such this is not intended for advanced users.\r\n\r\nMany people use tools and systems like Kali to run penetration tests without really knowing what we are doing. This tutorial will introduce a few tools and will have a vulnerable server or two for you to launch your attacks against ensuring this is a closer to real-life attack, rather than just theoretical.\r\n\r\nUsers will need a version of Kali Linux installed or the ability to quickly copy a virtual machine (VirtualBox is the suggested software for this). Short guidance at the beginning will be provided for this but users will need the VirtualBox software installed.\r\n\r\nWe will start by finding the device, then testing for vulnerabilities and attempting to gain access.\r\nA step-by-step guide will ensure that all people get some action and hopefully a greater understanding of the mindset and complexity of what it means to \"hack\" in to something. \r\n\r\nParticipant will need to bring their own laptop with the following minimum recommended specs:\r\n4GB RAM - 2 will be used by the VM, 20GB HDD space, at least 4 processors, wireless network card, VirtualBox or similar ( VMWare or KVM/QCOW etc). Only VirtualBox will be supported and I allow 10 minutes at most for setup.\r\n\r\nThis tutorial will be run by one of the writers of the TAFE NSW Cybersecurity course and a tutor for Cybersecurity at SCU on the Gold Coast.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
