title: 'JavaScript in 2017: You might (not) need a framework - David Vujic'
recordingDate: 1499244311
description: "JavaScript in 2017 is like \"Yeah, now you need webpack, babel, npm, yarn, React ...\". Redux? Relax. Developing a front end web project in 2017 can be a bit intimidating, especially when the home base is back end development.\n\nIn this session I will talk about & code JavaScript using old school methods and step-by-step add stuff like modules, Babel, ES 2017, ESLint & Webpack. Let's investigate the value added, how to keep it simple and some of the trade offs to be aware of. You'll know how to setup and develop an ECMAScript 2017 & React enabled web site, with automated build and real time syntax checking after this session. You might even have been transformed into a JavaScript hipster. Welcome!"
