title: 'YOW! Lambda Jam 2021 - Dana Ma - Abstract Fun-sense: a functional perspective on life'
language: English
recordingDate: 1628208771
description: "Everything can be a function if you look at it the right way; we can characterise familiar concepts like sets, lists and even plain values as functions.\nThinking about such basic objects as functions can seem unnecessarily abstract, but it isn’t just an exercise in increasingly intimidating notation! It turns out to be an elegant perspective that allows us to glimpse a more powerful abstraction.\nIn this talk, we’ll see how playing with this notion leads to the Yoneda Lemma, a key result in category theory. We’ll build up some intuition and motivation for the Yoneda Lemma, and return to the notion of viewing objects as functions to appreciate some of its implications.\n\nDana is currently a Staff Software Engineer at Zendesk in the Data Products team, where she works on harnessing the power of data to help Zendesk's customers help their customers help themselves. Prior to that, she worked in London building pipelines and wrangling data in the financial sector. As a functional programming enthusiast with a background in pure mathematics, she's enthusiastic about the potential of data to help people, but also harbours a solid appreciation for the beautifully esoteric.\n\nFor more information on YOW!
