Hadi Hariri, JetBrains — HTTP/2 – What do I need to know?\nКонференция DotNext 2015 Moscow\nМосква, 11.12.2015\n\nHTTP 1.1, which is the backbone of pretty much everything we’ve been using on the Internet, has been around for over 15 years. Recently the HTTP/2 specification has been completed and gradually application servers will start supporting it. It does make one wonder though, why change if something has been working for so long. In this talk we’ll examine the shortcomings of HTTP 1.1 and how 2 intends to address these. We’ll see what we need to know and how it’s going to affect our existing applications, and future ones."
