description: "Intro: CNCF CI - Lucina Stricko & Denver Williams, Vulk Coop & CNCF \n\nThe new and improved CNCF CI status dashboard -- cncf.ci -- provides a third party validation of builds, deployments and end-to-end testing for CNCF’s Graduated and Incubating projects. The CNCF CI status dashboard continually validates each CNCF project, for any commit on stable and head, running on Kubernetes clusters which are provisioned to a bare metal environment. The results of each testing stage are published to the cncf.ci status dashboard. An Intro session will give an overview of the cncf.ci status dashboard’s key features, goals, technologies used, and allow time for Q&A. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPhL"
