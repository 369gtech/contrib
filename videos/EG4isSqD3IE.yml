description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nData Science for Infrastructure: Observe, Understand, Automate - Zain Asgar & Natalie Serrino, New Relic\n\nCloud-native applications today are increasingly complex and therefore increasingly hard to understand. It’s critical to connect decisions around resource allocation and architecture to business metrics such as end-user latency, but very difficult to do in practice. Ultimately, understanding how your systems behave and why is a data analytics problem. Like most data analytics problems, the trick is in collecting and wrangling the right data sources.\n\nIn this talk, you will learn how Pixie, an open-source observability platform for Kubernetes, can be used to painlessly turn low-level telemetry data into high-level signals about system health. The talk will also show these high-level signals can be used as input to a variety of use cases, such as detecting SQL injections and K8s deployment autoscaling."
