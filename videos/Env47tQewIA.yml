title: 'YOW! Conference 2017 -  Doc Norton - The Technical Debt Trap'
language: English
recordingDate: 1520754550
description: "Technical Debt has become a catch-all phrase for any code that needs to be re-worked. Much like refactoring has become a catch-all phrase for any activity that involves changing code. These fundamental misunderstandings and comfortable yet mis-applied metaphors have resulted in a plethora of poor decisions. What is technical debt? What is not technical debt? Why should we care? What is the cost of misunderstanding? What do we do about it?\n\nDoc discusses the origins of the metaphor, what it means today, and how we properly identify and manage technical debt. In this talk Iâ€™ll share how these four principles power world-famous companies and how they can help you work with greater speed, simplicity, safety and success.\n\nDoc Norton is a software delivery professional working to make the world of software development a better place. His experience covers a wide range of development topics. Doc declares expertise in no single language or methodology and is immediately suspicious of anyone who declares such expertise.\n\nA frequent and well rated international speaker, Doc is passionate about helping others become better developers, working with teams to improve delivery, and building great organizations. In his role at CTO2, Doc is provided opportunities to realize his passion every day.\n\nFor more on YOW! conferences, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
