description: "MobileOptimized 2019\nAndroid track\n\nAndroid Insets — deal with fears and get ready for Android Q (Ru) - Konstantin Tskhovrebov @Redmadrobot\n\nWith the release of Android Q, two important things must be done: to support the system navigation with gestures and to make the status and navigation bars transparent. To do this, you need to stop looking for workarounds and figure out how insets work! Konstantin will talk about a long history of avoiding this problem, about studying and fighting with android, and finally about a complete understanding of this topic. In addition to supporting new recommendations in the system, you will stop being afraid of the keyboard, learn how to recognize its size and respond to its appearance.\n\nGeneral Partner –Apalon (https://www.apalon.com/)\nVideo Partner – Flo (https://flo.health/)"
