title: 'Building Visual Studio Code Extensions for the Unison Language - Part 4'
recordingDate: 1632982498
description: "Welcome to Augusts' #WednesdayStreams, this month we're exploring the Unison programming language and building VSCode Extensions with TypeScript.\n\nUnison is an experimental programming language from the future that promises to deliver big wins. Visual Studio Code is, well, you know what it is. Let's have a crack at improving the VSCode tooling for Unison!\n\n## About Your Host\n\nTom Sherman, in the words of his colleague:\n\n\"Tom has the ability to explain complex issues to team members who may not be as technically minded in a way that they not only understand, but can then make informed decisions upon.\n\nFurther to the above, Tom has also been my ‘go to person’ on many occasions when I needed some guidance when working with JavaScript, TypeScript, React and more. There is no doubt in my mind that Tom has a long and successful career ahead of him.\"\n\n## About Norfolk Developers\n\n## About Norfolk Developers\n\nYou might want to try something new or wish to take your software development up to the next level.
