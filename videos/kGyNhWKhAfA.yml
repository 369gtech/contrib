description: "JavaScript has established itself as one of the most popular programming languages. Spreading from the client side to the server side, it serves well in different situations. Furthermore, a new version, ES6, has been accepted and mostly implemented by all major browser vendors. JavaScript is however limited to what we, developers, could do in the browser. And we want to do a lot - video rendering, playing games, embracing mobile apps experience. All these things are already working today with the help of additional libraries and modules. However, Microsoft, Google, and Mozilla are already working on a new programming language - WebAssembly, that will bring low-level capabilities to the Web. What exactly is WebAssemby? Is this a threat to the well-established JavaScript? When can we expect to see it in action? In this talk I will provide some light into WebAssembly and will try to answer these questions. The Web is changing and we have to move on.\n\nDevConf 2017 (http://devconf.pl)\n13-15 September 2017"
