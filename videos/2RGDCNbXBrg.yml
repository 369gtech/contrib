language: English
recordingDate: 1594916853
description: "We get it. You like Spring Cloud Data Flow for Kubernetes (https://dataflow.spring.io/), but you also like to ‘flow’. You know every IDE keyboard shortcut. To others, your terminal screen looks like something out of The Matrix. GUI dashboards make you wince. \n\nNot a problem. Spring Cloud Data Flow includes a fully-featured command-line interface that you can use to keep your browser tab-count low and your productivity high. Let Ben Wilcock (@benbravo73) show you where to find the Spring Cloud Data Flow Shell (https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.springframework.cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow-shell) and how to get started using it.\n\nAll the code to accompany this series can be found on GitHub: https://bit.ly/scdf-code.\nFull HD (1920 x 1080p) - Fullscreen mode is recommended."
