description: "The combination of WebSockets with AngularJS is a fantastic stack for building reactive web applications - think constantly updating dashboards or a web based chat application. But what backend fits this model?\nYou guessed it: Play and Akka! This talk will take you through building the backend using the PlayFramework and Akka. The Actor model is perfect for reacting to events on the server side and pushing them to the client via a WebSocket. You’ll be shocked how simple this is to setup and get a basic application up and running.\nWe’ll be going through the KillrWeather application (https://github.com/killrweather/killrweather), which is an open source reference application for Apache Spark Streaming + Cassandra. Spark streaming is all about processing high volumes of data and building analytics on the fly, we’ll be showing how to get the processed data into a reactive front end"
