description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2016\n—\nThis talk is an overview of the open source static analysis tools for C++. The emphasis is on Clang based tools. While this talk is not intended to be a tutorial how to develop such tools I will cover the algorithms, methods and interesting heuristics that are utilized by them. Understanding these methods can be really useful as it helps us write more static analysis friendly code and understand the cause of false positive results. It will also help to understand limitations of the currently available tools. I will also present some guidelines how to make a library static analysis friendly, to make clients interested in such tools happy. I will also give a short tutorial on how to use these tools and how to integrate them into the work flow.\n— \nGabor Horvath\nSoftware Engineer, Ericsson\nGabor finished his Masters and started a PhD recently. He is a contributing to research projects related to static analysis since 2012. He is a clang contributor, participated in Google Summer of Code twice and interned at Apple. He teaches C++ to undergrads at Eotvos Lorand University.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
