title: 'Simon Thompson - Scaling Erlang on 10K or More Cores: An Overview of the RELEASE Project'
language: English
recordingDate: 1405700322
description: "Systems that are valuable have to be evolved. For instance, if you use a regular expression library in Erlang, you will have had to migrate from regexp to re; if you wish to migrate from R16 to R17, there are a number of changes that you may need to make.\n\nIn this talk we'll show how Wrangler can help with this. Wrangler has an API migration facility - which we'll demonstrate - and this is built on an extensibility API and DSL for Wrangler that allows you to write your own refactorings and transformations for yourself, using Erlang syntax to describe what it is you want to do.\n\nThe talk will be illustrated with short demos to show how it works hands on."
