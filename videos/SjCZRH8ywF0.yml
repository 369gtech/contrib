description: "This is a video of Ward Bekker's talk at the London Erlang Factory Lite in 2012 http://www.erlang-factory.com/\n\nErlang is designed for building massively scalable and highly available soft real-time systems. Unsurprisingly , Erlang provides us with powerful libraries for automated testing of these type of systems. In this talk, we take a look at three of the popular automated testing libraries for Erlang, discuss their individual strengths and weaknesses and illustrate the importance of continuous integration by deploying sample automated tests to Travis-CI, a free continuous integration service for the open source community.\n\nTalk objectives: Describe and explain popular Erlang automated testinging libraries (EUnit, QuickCheck, Common Test) and the advantages of continuous integration."
