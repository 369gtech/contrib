description: "Video from Devoxx Poland 2019.\n\nYou know what Docker containers are, but how to run Docker containers in production? How to ensure zero downtime deployment? How to instantly scale in case of peek loads?\n\nKubernetes is the number one orchestrator to host Docker containers and is offered by all major public clouds. Pascal will introduce you to Kubernetes using a real-world case and will show you how to get your Docker containers under control. This talk will make clear why itâ€™s great to use the cloud for running your container workloads. But you will also walk out of this session with a great fundamental knowledge of Kubernetes. Like what Pods, Services, Deployments, Secrets, Namespaces, and Ingress are and what you can do with it.\n\nJoin this session if you are starting the Kubernetes journey and need some help to get going!"
