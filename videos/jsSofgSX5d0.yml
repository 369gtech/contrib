recordingDate: 1492597157
description: "Oracle is getting serious about the cloud and is building out new new cloud services at a rapid pace. In order to build those hyper scale, resource efficient multi tenant services Oracle has chosen Docker containers and other technologies such as Mesos/Marathon and Kubernetes to optimize resource consumption and devops processes. Developing such services is just half of the story; the other half is how to apply devops best practices to it, so that you can run those services in an always on, hyper-scale and resilient way. Attend this session to hear the lessons learned by Oracle engineers from building those hyper-scale managed cloud services. They will discuss pros and cons of the architecture chosen, and will cover development as well as devops best practices which allow them to offer those services to their customers. Come find out about the new forces at work within Oracle today.\n\nBoris Scholl \nVP Development â€“ Microservices Oracle Cloud"
