description: "OSGi is a set of open standards, maintained by the OSGi Alliance, describing a dynamic module system for the Java language. Eclipse Concierge strives to be a minimal-footprint implementation of the OSGi core standards, particularly targeting resource-constrained embedded devices. This presentation explains how a downsized and optimized OSGi implementation can help you build modular and flexible Internet of Things applications.\n\n\nAuthors:\nJan Rellermeyer\nJan S. Rellermeyer received his MSc CS in Distributed Systems from ETH ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland, in 2006 and his PhD in Computer Science in the Systems Group at ETH in 2011.
