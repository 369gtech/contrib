description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nBuilding the Next Generation of Release Notes for Kubernetes and Beyond - Sascha Grunert, SUSE \n\nKubernetes is an open source project with a high velocity of PRs and releases. While the activity and interest in the project is awesome, communicating these changes to end users becomes difficult. For a long time, each release would generate a new release notes markdown document that required manual cleanup and curation. In recent months the format has been reconsidered and completely restructured. The majority of content in the previous markdown has become a widely used website!  Generating and publishing release notes for open source projects can be a pain point, especially as a project grows. Imagine if there was a solution usable with many different projects? This talk will go over the history of Kubernetes release notes, the current state of relnotes.k8s.io, and future plans for automated publishing of release notes and notifications.\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zeq6"
