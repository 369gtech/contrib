title: 'Distributed Load Testing with Kubernetes by Amanda Waite'

description: "Load testing is an important part of the software development lifecycle - it’s critical that you understand how your applications and infrastructure will hold up once they go into production. But basic load testing isn’t quite enough, you need to be able to model user behavior at scale to really get a feel for how your systems will perform under load.\n\nContainers and Kubernetes can help minimize the devops work associated with load testing. Containers rapidly scale, making them a great choice for simulating clients. And while working with individual containers is straightforward, managing a fleet of containers and orchestrating them can be difficult. Kubernetes, an open source container container orchestration system, makes it easy to deploy and manage many containers.\n\nIn this session we'll walk through setting up and scaling distributed load testing of a sample Java based application using both Apache JMeter and Gatling and then derive a simple pattern that can be used for testing a variety of different scenarios and applications."
