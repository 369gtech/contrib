The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nDeclarative Testing Clusters with KUTTL - Ken Sipe, D2iQ \n\nThe facts are the Kuttling releases a cocktail of hormones in our brains including dopamine, serotonin and oxytocin. It can lower your blood pressure and heart rate. Nothing raises your blood pressure more than software written for Kubernetes that isn't tested. The KUbernetes Test TooL (kuttl) is a tool for declarative testing of Kubernetes and Cloud Native software. kuttl empowers developers and end users to test operators, Helm charts, Kubernetes distributions, and Kubernetes itself. This session introduces attendees to testing kubernetes custom controllers using KUTTL with the expectation that all attendees already understand Kubernetes and operators. The session will include: * Testing in different environments; mocked, KinD and full stack clusters. * Test setup * Controller injecting * Asserting state goals Do yourself a favor... lets lower your blood pressure and KUTTL! \n\nhttps://sched.co/ekAs"
