title: 'Project Tango: Designing for Physical Boundaries'
language: English
recordingDate: 1447192665
description: "Project Tango is a new platform that allows mobile devices to track their motion. Users of Project Tango can move untethered around to explore virtual worlds. If the virtual space contains a large glacier, the users’ surroundings may prevent them from going places because of the boundaries of the physical world. Boundaries occur when the virtual world is either smaller than the physical or when the physical world can’t fit in the virtual world. In this episode Nicolai Munk Petersen talks about the physical boundaries and how to prevent them from causing problems.\n\nWatch more episodes of Project Tango here: https://goo.gl/mmC3JA\n\nSubscribe to the Google Developers channel at http://goo.gl/mQyv5L -\nSubscribe to the brand new Firebase Channel: https://goo.gl/9giPHG"
