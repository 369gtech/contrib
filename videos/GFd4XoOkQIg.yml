description: "Stephane Moriceau\n\nThe DevOps culture is similar to culture often seen in startups: a collegial environment with a strong sense of trust, collaboration, and overall accountability. As organizations grow in age and size they structure themselves usually breaking the original cohesion. Successful DevOps initiatives often require a challenging inherent culture shift. A very efficient way to deal with the challenges of change is to make it automatic and promote ease of use. This presentation focuses on how implementing a DevOps-enabled integrated cloud platform drives the desired behaviors and facilitates the adoption of change. Oracle Cloud Platform solutions will be highlighted to illustrate software delivery capabilities. Change is Hard! Tools can help!"
