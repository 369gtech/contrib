title: 'YOW! Connected 2016 Jon Manning & Tim Nugent - Building Containerised Microservices with Swift'
recordingDate: 1485324684
description: "There’s nothing better than containerizing things. Everybody loves microservices. Brand new programming languages are the new hotness.\n\nIn this session, we’ll combine all three: we’ll explore the use of Swift for the construction of microservices, which we’ll containerize using Docker. Learn how to use your mobile development skills for non-mobile Swift development.\n\nFocusing on the Swift open source project’s releases, we’ll walk through Swift setup, installation, community, and tools, and then teach the basics of Swift programming as we create and containerize a simple micro service. We’ll be using Docker for Mac.\n\nBy the end of this session, attendees will:\n\n* understand the basics of Swift\n* know how to install, and work with Swift on Linux\n* know how to build a simple microservice with Swift\n* be aware of the possibilities of combining Swift with Docker\n\nWe promise, despite the buzzwords, this is actually useful! Inch ever closer to being a full-stack developer using only Swift.\n\nJon Manning is a co-founder of Secret Lab, where he makes games and does research. He has an actual PhD about jerks on the internet, has written about a dozen technical books for O’Reilly Media, and wrote two games for ABC’s Play School and one for Qantas. He’s currently working on Button Squid, a top-down puzzler for iOS, and is fond of making cool tools for rad devs.\n\nTim Nugent pretends to be a mobile app developer, game designer, and PhD student, and now he’s even pretending to be an author. (He co-wrote the latest versions of Learning Cocoa with Objective-C, Swift Developement with Cocoa, Learning Swift, and the Kerbal Space Program Players Guide for O’Reilly.) When he isn’t busy avoiding being found out as a fraud, Tim spends most of his time designing and creating little apps and games he won’t let anyone see. He also spent a disproportionately long time writing this tiny little bio, most of which was taken up trying to stick a witty sci-fi reference in… before he simply gave up.\n\nFor more on YOW!
