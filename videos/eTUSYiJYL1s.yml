description: "Video from Devoxx Poland 2019.\n\nDoes Behaviour Driven Development work? Unfortunately, it usually does not. While many people try to pitch as a way to bridge the gap between stakeholders on the project, many teams fail to communicate their test scenarios with everyone involved. Although this fundamental problem of lack of communication can be solved on the organization level, BDD is often used with Cucumber or Robot frameworks. Due to the complexities of these tools, developers and testers stop seeing the benefit in the entire approach of BDD and abundant the practice. However, recently, Behavior Driven Development has seen a resurgence in adoption, thanks to Gauge framework. With the latest release of Taiko, they create a great combination of communication and testing tool with the use of Gauge+Taiko. In this talk, we will discuss BDD principles and how Gauge can be used to take Behavior Driven Development to the next level. With Taiko, the audience will learn on how BDD can be taken to the web in few easy steps and to see what needs to be avoided when these tools are implemented in any organization."
