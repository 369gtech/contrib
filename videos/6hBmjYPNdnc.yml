title: 'Serverless: what, why and how?'
language: English
recordingDate: 1631865173
description: "** Ever wondered what the fuss around serverless was all about? Or how serverless can even be a thing - software still has to run on a server somewhere, right? **\n\nFor many of us, deploying and running software in a remote environment is the task we dread and look to hand off to someone from Ops - but it doesn’t have to be that way! Let’s look at the ways in which serverless can make our lives easier.\n\nThis session aims to demystify some of the common questions, compare serverless to more traditional methods of running software and round it all off with a live demo to show how you can jump right in.\n\n## About Alex\n\nI’m a born and bred Norfolk geek, graduating from the University of East Anglia in 2018 (Computing Sciences) and going on to work for ubisend and BT before ending up as a Consultant Solution Engineer at Inawisdom.\n\nI have a passion for cloud computing and am an AWS certified Solution Architect and Developer. I firmly believe in making software development as easy as possible, especially as the line between software development and operations blurs and DevOps becomes the norm.\n\nYou can find me on Twitter at @alex_kearns.\n\n## Agenda\n\n19:15: ~~Doors~~ Zoom Call Open\n19:30: nor(DEV): Introduction - Begin streaming to YouTube.\n19:35: Speaker Slot\n20:20: Q&A\n20:30 Close...
