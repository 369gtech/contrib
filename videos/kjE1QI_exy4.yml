recordingDate: 1591703764
description: "Ittai Zeidman, Wix’s Backend Engineering Lead, was in the hospital with his wife and two-days-old new born baby, when he got an urgent call from the company’s VP of R&D. A crisis was unfolding: the build system was broken, leaving hundreds of developers unable to do their work. \n\nThis crisis wasn’t an isolated incident: it was the result of a series of problems resulting from the company’s success and fast growth. Ittai and his peers faced a serious challenge - but they knew they weren't the only ones: Google, Facebook, and Twitter were also serving millions of users. \n\nUtilizing and learning from these company's experiences, Ittai helped transform Wix’s build system from the ground up with Bazel, an open-source Continuous Integration system. How can developers face serious scaling issues, and implement company-wide infrastructure successfully?\n\nWe will also hear about Exodus, Wix Engineering’s open-source tool that can easily migrate your JVM code from Maven to Bazel, and go deeper on Bazel and Scaling with Natan Slinisky and Or Shahar.\n\nRead more on our blog:\n\n* https://www.wix.engineering/post/bazelcon-2019-lessons-learned-from-migrating-our-build-system-to-bazel\n\n* https://www.wix.engineering/post/introducing-exodus-easily-migrate-from-maven-to-bazel"
