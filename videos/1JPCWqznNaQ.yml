description: ".NET Summit 2020 Online Edition https://dotnetsummit.by - the 4th community driven .NET conference dedicated to practical experience of solving business challenges with .NET and technical challenges in .NET application.\n\nLoek Duys, Running a real-world mission-critical system on Azure [EN]\n\n\"Getting your .NET Core application to run on a Container Cluster is only part of the journey. It takes more to build and run your application in Azure using DevOps practices.\nIn this session I will show you how we created a mission-critical .NET Core application, running on Kubernetes in Azure, using Visual Studio 2019 and the Azure DevOps platform.\nYou will learn how to design your .NET application architecture to run on Azure, which software patterns to implement for resilience, how to build Continuous Integration and Deployment pipelines for zero-downtime and what to do to integrate metrics and instrumentation in your application for real-time monitoring.\nI will share our lessons learned, so you can get a jump-start running your application in a similar way\".\n\nGeneral Partner - ISsoft - https://issoft.by"
