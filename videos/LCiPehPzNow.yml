language: English
recordingDate: 1443201195
description: "In the modern world, you have access to vast amounts of data about everything. International organizations like World Bank collect thousands of indicators about all countries of the world, Open Government Data initiatives publish data sources about environment, transport, society and much more.\n\nIn this talk, you'll see how F# and type providers make it easy to access the data around you and build interesting visualizations that help you understand the world. We won't be limited just to public open data sources though - you can use the same ideas for working with any XML and CSV files or JSON-based REST services.\n\nHowever, we will go a bit further than that - what if every data analysis or news report that comes with a chart was actually a little script that you could re-run and modify to validate its correctness and dig a bit deeper if you were curious about the topic?"
