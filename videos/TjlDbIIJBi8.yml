Like all Spring projects, the real power of Spring Security is found in how easily it can be extended to meet custom requirements. In this presentation Rob will start with an insecure application and incrementally Spring Security 4 to demonstrate how easily you can secure your application. Throughout the presentation, new features found in Spring Security 4 will be highlighted. Whether you are new to Spring Security or are wanting to learn what is new in Spring Security 4, this presentation is a must!"
