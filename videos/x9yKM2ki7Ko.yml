description: "Have you ever been a part of a team where BDD turned from productive collaboration into nitpicking the specifics of a Given When Then example? Have you seen the focus move from shared understanding to automation? Why does this happen?\n\nKatrina will share the reasons that she’s seen an initial enthusiasm for BDD turn into a reluctance to participate. Based on her experiences in a variety of agile teams, she will introduce the idea of a BDD lifecycle and explain the actions or behaviours that might trigger a team to move through the stages of her model. She’ll also explain why some teams just want chocolate.\n\nYou’ll leave this session with an understanding of where your current process fits in the model, ideas to drive movement through the lifecycle by creating change in your team, and reassurance to the battle-hardened that you are not alone in your experiences with BDD."
