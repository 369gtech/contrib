description: "The Circle Of Lifecycle Events by Nelson Wittwer\n\n\"To the new software developer wanting to build a web app with Rails, callbacks and associations are gifts from the gods. As your application grows in complexity however, you may notice your favorite tools have actually turned on you. New users suddenly aren't getting welcome emails and you've somehow orphaned associations. Come learn proven patterns for managing lifecycle events for associated records in a way that sparks joy.\"\n\n__________\n\nNelson has spent most of his career working within Rails typically building new startups/products but has also maintained and iterated on platforms at scale supporting tens of millions of users. Nelson is a personable guy who loves to make people laugh.  Nelson currently lives in the Raleigh/Durham area and works for MX.com building banking/fintech products."
