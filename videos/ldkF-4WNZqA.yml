title: '"You are a Program Synthesizer" by James Koppel'
language: English
recordingDate: 1539706701
description: "Over the best decade, program synthesis has gone from twiddling bits to making web browsers. And the insights behind these systems can also be used by a much older and better program synthesizer: you.\n\nIn this talk, I'll explain how program synthesis and verification works from the angle of what they can teach us about normal programming. I'll explain how notions of code quality are really based on mathematical and mental constructs which are ethereal in programming, but concrete in theorem proving. You'll learn the process of deriving code from a specification, and why some parts of the code synthesize instantly, while others take cleverness. I'll show you how to use Hoare logic to analyze your code's complexity, how to use abstract interpretation to count the \"states\" of code, and how it's possible for straight-line code to contain a conditional. At the end of this talk, you'll have a better idea of what makes good vs. bad code, and how bad code makes life difficult for all kinds of program synthesizers, both machine and human.\n\nJames Koppel"
