description: "Serverless computing is a powerful way for JavaScript developers to create backend services that can power a variety of experiences from the browser to IoT devices. At Adobe, we are embracing serverless as a way to enable our developer ecosystem to easily create experience applications that extend our solutions. We’re building this platform, Adobe I/O Runtime, on top of an open source project, Apache OpenWhisk. In this talk you’ll learn about Apache OpenWhisk, what kinds of use cases are good for serverless, and how to use build serverless applications using NodeJS. Using Adobe I/O Runtime, you’ll see how to deploy code as serverless functions, how event-driven architecture can be a powerful compliment for serverless, how to build more complex applications by combining multiple functions, and how to expose your functions as APIs so they can be used across multiple experiences. You’ll walk away with a clear picture of where it makes sense to use serverless computing and how to get started.\n\nBased in San Francisco, by way of Vancouver, Canada and Singapore, Shaz has nearly two decades of software development experience getting with the nitty gritty of Windows, OS X and iOS and probably helped code something you know. Currently he is on the Adobe I/O team and also helps maintain the iOS platform of Apache Cordova + Adobe PhoneGap and has been part of that project for quite some time.\n\n\nJSConf.Asia - Capitol Theatre, Singapore - 25 January 2018\n\nSource: https://2018.jsconf.asia/\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
