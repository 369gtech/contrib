description: 'Erlang is much more powerful than languages such as Java or C++ and at the same time is a much simpler language and far easier to learn. Making the language easy to pick up was one of the original design goals of the Erlang development team. It doesn''t take much time to be able to benefit from its amazing features. It is dynamic language with simple and concise syntax, well suited for rapid prototyping of distributed systems. It was designed to build robust, fault-tolerant, highly concurrent applications. It allows light-weight massive concurrency, code change at runtime and makes both the development and maintenance easier as well as cheaper.'
