title: 'Kubernetes YAML + Science = Sanity'

description: "In this session, I would like to reimagine how we can work with YAML. It isn’t going away, but it doesn’t have to be a barrier. We’ll start with a small example and incrementally add new functionality. Next, we’ll show how we can introduce concepts like generators and transformers to make our YAML extensible. The concept of knobs and switches will be introduced to show how you can make your YAML consumable by others. Then we’ll walk through a few use cases to show how we can use science to make YAML work for us instead of the opposite. At the end of the session, participants will leave with insights on how to tame the YAML in their projects.\n\nBryan Liles: Sr. Staff Engineer at VMware\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/kubernetes-yaml-science-sanity"
