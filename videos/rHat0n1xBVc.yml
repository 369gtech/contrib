description: "JavaScript-конференция HolyJS 2016 Moscow\n11 декабря 2016 года\n\nRich text editing is super hard. Many developers nowadays don't build rich text experiences and if they do they are very limited. This is because rich text editing is inherently hard and features like the HTML attribute contenteditable are broken. Only few companies like Medium provide a solid solution, but they never open sourced it.\n\nDraft.js was released earlier this year and is a rich text editing framework that fixes contenteditable and syncs the DOM to a immutable data-structure. This allows you to control the rendering with React components as well as manipulating the content in nice and sane way.\n\nIn the talk Nik will explain how the data-structure works and show how decorators, block renderers and style-maps can be used to create features like @-mentions, drag & drop images, linkify or hashtags and combine them in one editor."
