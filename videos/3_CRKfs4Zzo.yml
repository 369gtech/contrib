description: "Jeremy Davis, Principal Solution Architect, Red Hat\nJim Tyrrell, Senior Princple Solutions Architect, Red Hat\n\nThinkster’s RealWorld (http://realworld.io) is “the mother of all demo apps.” It enables developers to mix any front end (React, Angular 2, and more) and any back end (Node, Django, Ruby on Rails, and more). Eclipse Vert.x is highly scalable, polyglot, useful, flexible, and (most importantly) fun! It’s also a great runtime for websites and APIs. This session’s presenters will build a RealWorld website back end in Eclipse Vert.x. and cover\n• Quickly spinning up new Eclipse Vert.x projects\n• Developing/testing REST APIs\n• Securing access with JWT\n• Persisting state with MongoDB and MySQL\n• Generating Vert.x code from a Swagger document\n\nAfter this session, you’ll know everything you need to build your next project with Eclipse Vert.x."
