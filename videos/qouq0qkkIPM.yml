Adding too many if/else, handling a lot of complexity or hacking several non-desired side effects.\nDid you ever have a problem with double-clicking an async button? Fetching multiple times the same resource in a row? Did you have problems translating UX interfaces and mock-ups into your applications scenes?\n\nAll these kind of problems can be properly fixed by applying a different point of view. An architecture based upon Mealy state machines. Also known as finite state machines or automatas. These machines are deterministic, pure and idempotents. Opening a new set of possibilities from predictable components to autogenerated tests.\n\nLetâ€™s take a look at this new paradigm for UI components.\nYouâ€™ll discover a better and cleaner world ðŸ˜‰\n \n\nWhat are the key takeaways from this talk?\nDefine your app states in advance; even if youâ€™re not using an FSM\nFSM can reduce to 0 the number of run-time bugs your app produces.\n\nLibraries:\n- State machines and statecharts for the modern web. https://github.com/davidkpiano/xstate\n- A state machine abstraction for React https://github.com/michelebertoli/react-automata\n- an open source platform for network analysis and visualization https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape\n\nReads:\n- Constructing the User Interface with Statecharts: Ian Horrocks (book)\n- Pure UI https://rauchg.com/2015/pure-ui\n- STATECHARTS: A VISUAL FORMALISM FOR COMPLEX SYSTEMS*  http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/seoc/2005_2006/resources/statecharts.pdf\n- Welcome to the world of Statecharts https://statecharts.github.io/\n\nReal World Example:\nVSCode telemetry\n\n\nRubÃ©n (@sospedra_r) is a Frontend engineer, Javascript hacker, Crossfiter and paleo-chef.
