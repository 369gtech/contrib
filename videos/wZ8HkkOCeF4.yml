description: "https://media.ccc.de/c/asg2017/ASG2017-111-meson_and_the_changing_linux_build_landscape\n\n\n\nThe Meson build system has been picking up steam this year and many\nfundamental projects have transitioned to it from their old build\nsystems. In this talk we shall look at the advantages and disadvantages these transitions have brought, what we can expect from the future of build systems and what effect this change may have on the larger Linux ecosystem.\n\n\n\nJussi Pakkanen"
