description: "Domain-Driven Design Europe 2018\nhttps://dddeurope.com/\nhttps://twitter.com/ddd_eu\nFind Context Boundaries with Domain Storytelling\nDDD practitioners want to identify bounded contexts and work out ubiquitous languages. Domain experts, however, often work together across contexts. The boundaries that shape our software systems must therefore not become borders that prevent people from working together. Domain Storytelling helps us to see how bounded contexts are connected. Domain Storytelling means that we bring together domain experts and developers. We let them tell us stories about their collaborative tasks. While listening, we record the stories using a pictographic language. The experts can see immediately whether or not we understand their story. After very few stories, we are able to talk about the people, tasks, tools, work items, and events in that domain. The visualized stories give us clues for finding context boundaries. As we learn more about a domain and refine our ubiquitous languages, we will adapt the context boundaries. The talk will consist of two parts: We introduce Domain Storytelling with a short, interactive tutorial. In the second part, we will discuss examples. These will illustrate how to find context boundaries and how to capture cooperation across contexts.\n\nBIOGRAPHY\n\nStefan is bad at drawing stuff. However, he thinks he can build up domain knowledge by drawing Domain Stories. Stefan studied Software Engineering in Austria and has a PhD in computer science. Since 2005, he has been working for WPS – Workplace Solutions Ltd. In Hamburg. Stefan hops from one domain to the next, assisting people to figure out how software can help them to get their job done.\n\nHenning loves to code. He follows this passion as a software architect and consultant at WPS – Workplace Solutions in Hamburg, Germany. His projects are domain-driven designed, agile and in programming languages like Java, C# and even ABAP. Henning is interested in the evolution of domain models, long-living software architectures and big refactorings. Recently he translated »Domain-Driven Design distilled« into german. Henning is married and has children."
