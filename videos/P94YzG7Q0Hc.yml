description: "Video recording of a presentation given at JDK IO conference in Copenhagen in June 2018 at the IT-University organized by the Danish Java User Group - Javagruppen.\n\nhttps://jdk.io/jdk-io-2018/speakers/224-ryan-cuprak\n\nAdvanced Integration Testing\n\nSpeaker: Ryan Cuprak\n\nIn this session you will learn how to use Arquillian and several of its extensions to construct powerful tests for Java EE and Spring. Extensions to be covered in this session include Cube, Cube Q, Graphene, Warp, and Drone. With these extensions, you get the power of Arquillian along with Docker and Kubernetes. Extensions such as Cube Q enable you to simulate network issues and introduce latency and bandwidth problems as well as unreachable services. This will cover all of these extensions and also how to leverage Mockito to create interesting test scenarios."
