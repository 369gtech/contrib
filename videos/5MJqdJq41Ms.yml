description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nTurn It Up to a Million: Ingesting Millions of Metrics with Thanos Receive - Lucas Servén Marín, Red Hat \n\nThanos is an open-source CNCF Sandbox project that builds upon Prometheus components to create a global-scale and highly available monitoring system. In this talk, Lucas Servén presents a solution for creating a multi-tenant horizontally scalable metrics ingestion system using the newest addition to the Thanos toolset: the Thanos Receive component. The talk considers the motivations for building a system capable of ingesting metrics from thousands of clusters, including: multi-cluster monitoring and cluster telemetry. Lucas discusses how Thanos Receive is able to satisfy these requirements and how its hash ring design allows it to scale and maintain ingestion availability even during upgrades. Finally, the talk demonstrates the practice of running an automatically scalable hash ring by leveraging the Thanos Receive Controller, Horizontal Pod Autoscaler, and the Prometheus Adapter.\n\nhttps://sched.co/ZejZ"
