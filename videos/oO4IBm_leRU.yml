description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nSponsored Session: New Relic - Flexible, Open and Easy Observability for Developers\n\nSpeakers: Zain Asgar, Michelle Nguyen\n\nAt New Relic, we believe that observability will be open, painless, and a part of every developer’s workflow. Observability should work out-of-the-box, be on by default, and utilize open standards like Open Telemetry. As part of this vision, we are making a bold bet by Open Sourcing Pixie, a Kubernetes native in-cluster observability platform that uses eBPF to automatically capture service level requests and metrics without any manual instrumentation. Furthermore, Pixie includes a fully distributed data system allowing for unsampled visibility into all the data generated by your application. Pixie embraces OpenTelemetry for both ingress and egress, allowing easy vendor-agnostic integration."
