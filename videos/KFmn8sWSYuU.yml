recordingDate: 1529936746
description: "React's component model makes it easy to reuse UI code, but reusing components across projects, applications, and teams is only possible if developers can find, install, and rely on each other's code. @walmartlabs, we have hundreds of developers working across dozens of teams, and one of the biggest obstacles to their productivity is duplication of work that's already been completed elsewhere in the organization. In this talk, you'll learn about the technical means we used to achieve this goal, and the processes and policies that facilitate and encourage code reuse throughout @walmartlabs.\n\nTalk given by Alex Grigoryan at Node Summit 2017.\n\nThanks to Node Summit for giving us permission to post this talk. freeCodeCamp is not associated with this talk. We're just excited to bring more exposure to to it!\n\n--\n\nLearn to code for free and get a developer job: https://www.freecodecamp.com\n\nRead hundreds of articles on programming: https://medium.freecodecamp.com\n\nAnd subscribe for new videos on technology every day: https://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=freecodecamp"
