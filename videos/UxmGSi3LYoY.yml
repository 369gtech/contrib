description: "Leading change in a large and profitable enterprise is challenging for a number of reasons ranging from organizational inertia to project prioritization. Patience and persistence will be needed for leaders tasked with driving change while maintaining profitability. Successful leaders must also balance existing corporate success against the opportunity to improve. Pursuing new ideas always comes with the risk of failure, but failing to continuously improve will also lead to quickly losing market share in a very competitive market. For many large organizations, better IT automation offers a great way to enable innovative risk-taking through cost reduction and faster delivery.\n\nThis talk is a summary of my experiences championing better infrastructure service delivery through automation. I will share the approach we took and the challenges we faced, as well as a few tips learned from mistakes we'd made along the way."
