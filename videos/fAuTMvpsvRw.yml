title: '[VDZ19] Multilingual Data Processing with GraalVM by Vojin Jovanovic'
language: English
recordingDate: 1553603585
description: "We open a new chapter for database stored routines by enabling execution of multilingual code inside databases such as Oracle and MySQL Server. The multilingual stored routines have all the benefits of the existing stored routines, such as reduced network traffic and enhanced security. But now, we can leverage vast library ecosystems of multiple languages to implement complex programs and run them efficiently close to the persisted data.\n\nIn this talk, we present the integration between the GraalVM runtime and MySQL Server. During the presentation, we demo how to define and execute multilingual stored-programs, how to seamlessly deploy existing code from a source repository to the database, and how to debug multilingual code running in MySQL Server. Finally, we show that the execution of JavaScript programs in MySQL Server outperforms client-side execution."
