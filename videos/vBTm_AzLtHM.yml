description: "Deep Learning Architectures for Semantic Relation Detection Tasks\nSneha Rajana, Amazon\nPresented at MLconf San Francisco 2019\n\nAbstract: Recognizing and distinguishing specific semantic relations from other types of semantic relations is an essential part of language understanding systems. Identifying expressions with similar and contrasting meanings is valuable for NLP systems which go beyond recognizing semantic relatedness and require to identify specific semantic relations. In this talk, I will first present novel techniques for creating labelled datasets required for training deep learning models for classifying semantic relations between phrases. I will further present various neural network architectures that integrate morphological features into integrated path-based and distributional relation detection algorithms and demonstrate that this model outperforms state-of-the-art models in distinguishing semantic relations and is capable of efficiently handling multi-word expressions.\n\nSee Sneha's presentation slides on our slideshare page here: https://www.slideshare.net/SessionsEvents/sneha-rajana-deep-learning-architectures-for-semantic-relation-detection-tasks/SessionsEvents/sneha-rajana-deep-learning-architectures-for-semantic-relation-detection-tasks"
