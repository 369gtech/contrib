description: "I've designed an image classifier template for you to use as a learning tool! This is an example of how machine learning can be used in a software-as-a-service context, hopefully it gives you some ideas on how to do something similar. It's a combination of a few components including a Python web API, Flutter mobile app, and FastAI model training script. In this episode, I'll explain the process of building this template and how all the components fit together. Enjoy!\n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/image_classifier_template\n\nCoding challenge (Due Date: Oct 5 2019 Midnight PST):\n1. Build an image classification service\n2.
