recordingDate: 1573502402
description: "Do you have large data sets that seem too big to map? (aka.ms/IoTShow/MapsClustering) Watch this IoT show to learn how to cluster data in Azure Maps so your users can rapidly extract insights from very large data sets. Ricky Brundritt, Principal Technical Program Manager, Azure Maps, takes you on a historical journey from grid-based clustering to radius-based clustering. You’ll learn how the power of the open source community has contributed to the supercluster library which Azure Maps leverages extensively. Watch Ricky demo and step through Azure Maps code for clustering using large data sets of shipwrecks and earthquakes. Learn how to use cluster aggregates to perform calculations based on properties of the children of each cluster. Ricky wraps up with a demo visualizing clustered map data in the form of pie charts—again, to enable your users to extract insights quickly.\n\nAccess demo source code here: https://aka.ms/AzureMapsSamples\n\n#iot #azureiot #azuremaps"
