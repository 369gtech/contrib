description: "JavaScript-конференция HolyJS 2016 Moscow\n11 декабря 2016 года\n\nA talk about what could happen if the wrong person combine multiple buzzwords and press the wrong button — and it played the situation for laughs. The main goal of this talk is to analyze 2 different and at the moment popular buzzwords — serverless and chatbots; combine them with node.js and simple NLP and show how easy is to build useful chatbots with insignificant cost of the infrastructure. Talk will contain following: — Introduction to serverless and AWS Lambda, and explanation why and what it is useful for. — Introduction to chatbots including a short history, an overview of the currently available platforms and a short intro to NLP. — Combining that in a practical example that shows how to develop a chatbot with node.js and simple NLP and how to deploy it to AWS Lambda for a fraction of the cost of a classical server infrastructure and in some cases for $0/month."
