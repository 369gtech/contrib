description: "How to Champion SRE Investment to Different Levels of Leadership\n\nLyon Wong, Blameless, and Christina Tan, EloquentSpeaking\n\nReaching higher levels of the organization is essential to achieving broader adoption of SRE. Without the right buy-in even if parts of SRE are rolled out, behaviors will regress. How then do you get this support? It starts with finding out the incentives needed by key levels of leadership and how to effectively speak to those. It also requires listening to the resistance to SRE adoption, and then effectively address that resistance with reason and metrics. In this talk, I share how to persuade the right level of leadership so that an organization can progress the adoption of SRE through key stages. I provide case studies of how real companies have succeeded or failed with their SRE adoption. This talk aims to equip the audience with the tools to promote SRE adoption through a grassroots/bottoms-up approach.\n\nView the full SREcon19 Asia/Pacific program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon19asia/program.\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
