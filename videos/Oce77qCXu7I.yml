title: 'GopherCon UK 2021: Daniela Petruzalek - Building an Indie Game in GO'
recordingDate: 1637596235
description: 'Go is an awesome systems language and we all know it. But how good is it for developing your own indie games? In a market dominated by Unity and Unreal, in this talk we will explore the feasibility of writing your own game in Go using Ebiten. The talk will be structured in a devlog format, where we will walk through the process of rebuilding an old 80’s card game called Travel Around the World (original: ‘Volta ao Mundo’ in Portuguese) from game design to a working prototype. By the end of this talk you will be exposed to: Ebiten basics, loading assets, handling graphics, game loop, testing, basic AI, player input and other related concepts.'
