description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2018\n—\nGiven a function: void foo(int a, int b); \n\nWouldn't it be great to be able to write? foo(\"b\" = 3, \"a\" = 2); \n\nThis will be a live coding session where we start from the basic idea of what we want to do and build up a small library similar that accomplishes this goal. We will outline some simply but powerful programming techniques and give a brief outline on how to use Hana, a powerful library for metaprogramming. \n— \nRichard Powell, Audio Software Engineer\n\nI started using C++ 10 years ago to write a psychoacoustic audio encoder/decoder and have continued to explore how to make software that unlocks the potential of hardware to bring amazing applications to life. I graduated from UC Berkeley with a BS in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, and worked throughout the Bay Area for the past 15 years. I enjoy teaching and learning about C++ and programming.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
