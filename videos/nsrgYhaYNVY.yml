description: "Join Jim Bennett, Azure Cloud Advocate, (https://aka.ms/iotshow/azuremapsgeofencing) to learn how to code geofencing applications with Visual Studio, Python, and Azure Maps. A geofence is a virtual boundary defining an area on a map. Using tools in Azure Maps, Jim demos how to test if a coordinate is inside or outside the Microsoft Redmond campus boundary. Jim explains why and how to manage a buffer around your geofence boundary. (Hint: GPS is not that accurate!) He also demos how to set a notification using a web hook and an Azure Logic App when a person or item enters or leaves a geofence area. Geofencing has many practical applications. It can be used to send an alert if an expensive piece of machinery leaves a construction site unexpectedly or to send a warning if a worker enters an unsafe location within a factory.\n\nNext steps:\n\n1.
