description: "Speaker: Josh Long\nIt's been an amazing year for Spring! 2013 saw the Spring family join Pivotal where - along with Cloud Foundry and our data driven technologies (the Pivotal HD Hadoop distribution, the GemFire data grid, and the RabbitMQ message broker) - Spring supports today's application workloads and profiles. Today's Spring embraces Java 8, Scala, Groovy, provides a best-in-class REST stack, supports the open web, mobile applications, big-data applications and batch workloads. Today's Spring is easy to get started with, easy to learn, and embraces conventions over configuration. Today's Spring is part of the Spring.IO platform. Today's Spring is...Pivotal. Join Spring developer advocate Josh Long as he re-introduces you to today's Spring, a Spring you may not have seen yet.\n\nLearn more about Spring at http://www.spring.io"
