description: "DOES19 Las Vegas — In many enterprises, Agile and DevOps transformations are starting to get board level visibility as the need to become a software innovator becomes critical to company survival and success. But how many of these transformations are on track in terms of producing the results that the business is expecting? How many of these organizations are tracking the results of these transformations, rather than just the activities, such as training and tool deployments? The fundamental problem is that the way these transformations are structured has a very different meaning to the technology side than it does to the business. Key concepts that should be shared by both sides, such as technical debt, are not part of the common language. It is these disconnects that cause large-scale transformations to fall off the rails.\n \nIn this talk, Dr. Kersten presents the lessons and flow diagnostics learned from the past year of organizations’ shifts from project to product.  He will then present predictions and prescriptions to help our organizations and careers thrive beyond the Turning Point.\n\nDOES19 Las Vegas\nDOES 2019 US\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
