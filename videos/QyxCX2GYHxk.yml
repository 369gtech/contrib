description: "There is a lot of buzz around gRPC right now. The biggest thing I hear is that it is confusing and people aren't sure when or how to use it. In this video, I am going to introduce gRPC in C#, show you how to set it up, and how to consume a gRPC service. We will also discuss when gRPC might be the right choice and when it probably isn't the right choice.\n\nSource Code: https://leadmagnets.app/?Resource=IntroToGRPC\n\nPatreon (the $10 or more level gets you the gRPC Tips and Tricks handout): https://www.patreon.com/IAmTimCorey\n\nNewsletter signup (with exclusive discounts, giveaways, and more):  https://signup.iamtimcorey.com/"
