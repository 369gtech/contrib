description: "\"We value working software over comprehensive documentation\" is what the manifesto for agile software development says, with the typical misinterpretation of these few words being \"don't write documentation\".\n\nOf course, that's not what the manifesto says and \"no documentation\" certainly wasn't the intent. It seems that many software teams have lost the ability to communicate what it is they are building and it's no surprise that these same teams often seem to lack technical leadership, direction and consistency. This session will look at various approaches and tools that you can use to visualise, document and explore your software architecture in order to build a better team."
