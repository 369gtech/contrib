title: 'CON1615   Meet Snoop, a Discovery Service for Java EE'
language: English
recordingDate: 1449594410
description: "Service discovery is a common pattern for building distributed systems, such as microservice-oriented architectures. The Spring Cloud project offers an extremely simple no-boilerplate way of creating and interacting with a discovery service, based on the Netflix OSS component Eureka. Wouldn’t it be nice if we had something similar for Java EE? That is where Snoop comes in. It is a Java EE alternative to Eureka—all open source, of course. This session explains the concept of service discovery and demos how it is handled in Spring Cloud Netflix. It then shows how to build a similar service with Java EE technologies.\n\nSpeaker:\nIvar Grimstad, Principal Consultant, Cybercom Sweden\nIvar Grimstad is an experienced software architect focusing on Enterprise Java. He is member of the Java Community Process and in the Expert Groups for JSR 368 (JMS 2.1), JSR 371 (MVC 1.0) and JSR 375 (Java EE Security API). He has been working with Java since the beginning and has over the years tried out everything from lightweight mobile applications to large scale enterprise applications. His experience covers all aspects of designing architectures based on a variety of technologies including standard Java EE as well as more lightweight frameworks such as Spring and a variety of open source products. Ivar is always focusing on quality and on using the right tools and technologies for the right task to optimize the software development process. Ivar is a frequent speaker at conferences, locally as well as internationally."
