title: 'Reverse engineering a legacy software in a complex system: A systems engineering approach'
recordingDate: 1569839069
description: "Maximiliano Moraga\n\nIn a complex system, a legacy software as a component is determined by various factors beyond its own capability. Lack of knowledge that shaped software, which is often the case of a legacy software, can prohibit appropriate maintenance and development to comply with the system needs. To reverse engineering legacy software for a fit with the overall system of interest is a daunting task. Existing techniques of reverse engineering are mostly from a purely technical point of view and for the single discipline of software engineering.\n\nThus, this paper aims for an approach to properly reverse engineer the reasoning behind the legacy software developments in a complex system. By jointly apply the CAFCR model and the reverse engineering, a roadmap is created to guide incremental developments of legacy software in a complex system, which benefits both the maintenance of existing implementation and realization of new functionalities for improved system performance.\n\nSave the date for NDC TechTown 2020  (31st of August - 3rd of September)\n\nCheck out more of our talks at: \nhttps://ndctechtown.com/\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/"
