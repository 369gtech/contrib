description: "Recording brought to you by American Express. https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs\nBuilding mobile apps is what we love to do, but there's always one nagging problem â€” writing server side components to support our apps can be surprisingly complex and difficult. There's a lot of overhead and a bunch of unfamiliar languages, frameworks, and styles of programming that we're not used to.\n\nBut fear the server no more, here comes Ktor!\n\nIn this talk we'll walk through a real world example of how #Ktor (and your existing knowledge of Kotlin) makes building server side components for your app a breeze. We'll start with a basic introduction of Ktor and its components, but we'll quickly get to building something real. Using a well known service/API, we'll walk through everything you normally need to get up and running: authentication, getting data, posting data, and deployment.\n\nBy the end of the talk you'll have a good idea of how to hook up your own server side components to pretty much any API out there. Let's conquer the server with Ktor!\n\nResources:\nKotlinConf website: https://jb.gg/fyaze5\nKotlinConf on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlinconf\n\nKotlin website: https://jb.gg/pxrsn6\nKotlin blog: https://jb.gg/7uc7ow\nKotlin on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlin\n\n#KotlinConf19 #Kotlin #JetBrains\n\nAbout the Presenter:\nDan has been an Android programmer at Basecamp for five ears, and prior to that had been working with Java for...a long time.\n\nHe's always enjoyed Android development, but working with Kotlin the past few years has rocketed that enthusiasm to a whole new level. The Android and Kotlin communities have been instrumental to his work and career, and he's a big believer in paying that forward.\n\nOutside of work, he's an avid Dad, donut aficionado, pizza lover, and emoji enthusiast ðŸ˜‰."
