language: English
recordingDate: 1568596372
description: "Open Source Software (OSS) is built on a rich history of myths and metaphors. This talk will examine these myths and metaphors, and how physical metaphors can lead us astray in a digital world. It will also explain why Open Source Software is not a vending machine, and how OSS development and distribution platforms can impact the value people place on open source software.\n\nClojurists Together is an organisation created to help support and grow critical open source Clojure software. This talk will discuss our experience growing Clojurists Together and some insights it has given us into:\n\n    How people think about value and open source software\n    The importance of framing, and the language you use\n    Future metaphors for funding OSS that we think can lead to a healthier relationship between open source creators and users\n\nDaniel Compton\nFalcon\n@danielwithmusic\n\nDaniel Compton is a software engineer living in Morrinsville New Zealand. He has been involved in the Clojure community since 2014, working on a number of open source projects including Kibit, re-frame, and re-frame-10x.
