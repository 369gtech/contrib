description: 'Java EE is productive and easy to learn and runs smoothly on containers such as Docker and rkt. It has become the perfect microservices platform. Unfortunately, no one in the enterprise is interested in managing thousands of nanoservices “just for fun.” In this session, the presenter hacks on stage a couple of Java EE 7/8 “rightsized” services, links them together, runs them on Docker, and explains the architectural decisions and best practices in real time.'
