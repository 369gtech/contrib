description: "Are you a solo developer?\nDo you cringe when you have to have change code you wrote a year ago? a month ago? last week?\nHave you thrown away working code which solved the right problem but for the wrong people at the wrong time?\nWant to develop the right app for the right people in the shortest time?\nThis presentation will steer you in that direction\nWe have merged Modern::Perl and Agile methods to reliably make apps which can be built quickly and changeable for years to come.\nThis is a workflow, not just an application. You can pick and choose what you want or commit to the whole system and see how it works for you.\nYou have nothing to lose, nothing to buy, everything to gain and you are using the tools you know.\nLets get started today and deliver tomorrow!"
