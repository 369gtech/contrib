description: "Наша группа в ФБ: https://www.facebook.com/qafest/\nНаш сайт: www.qafest.com\n\nДоклад на конференции QA Fest 2017 в Киеве.\nQuality Assurance industry keeps changing very fast. Sometimes back it was a standard to use Waterfall, gate keepers of the quality were large QA departments and it took months to deliver software to customers.\nDuring the last decade many companies decided to move from Waterfall to Agile, added Mobile apps to their portfolio, some got rid of QA departments and made feature developers test their own code. It worked well for some companies but it failed badly for others.\nThe talk is about the way how we overcame some of the challenges in Mobile software development and quality - testing on right level, risk-based testing, mobile test automation and QE processes."
