description: "How do we achieve high performance Neural Networks for Self-Driving Cars? We will consider frequently encountered obstacles and proven solutions. This event builds on the Behavorial Cloning presentation from 20 April and will be more technical. We will explain data manipulation, neural network tricks, and computer vision to unlock better performance without collecting more data.
