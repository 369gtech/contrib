description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nEffective Kubernetes Onboarding - Kathleen Juell, DigitalOcean \n\nKubernetes has a steep learning curve, but many teams need to learn Kubernetes – quickly. This talk will cover strategies for onboarding developers to Kubernetes, taken from DigitalOcean's Developer Education team – the producers of DO's Community tutorials – and the Community Platform team, which develops the Community application. It will include 1. Core concepts and insights from DO's new Kubernetes for Full-Stack Developers curriculum; 2. An on-the-ground perspective taken from the Community Platform team's migration from a traditional VM environment to Kubernetes.  Key concepts the talk will cover: 1. How to onboard teams successfully by establishing knowledge baselines and effectively organizing, structuring, and delivering Kubernetes concepts. 2. How to situate Kubernetes in a larger arc of application development and integrate it into an existing development workflow.\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zeso"
