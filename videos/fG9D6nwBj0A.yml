Well, it's about time you unleashed your imagination! And in case you would be complaining about C++ right now... hold it right there, your trusty old friend, JavaScript will help you out here, too. ;)\r\n\r\nWe will have a look at MicroCanvas a tiny HTML5 Canvas games framework for creating pixelgraphic HTML5 games that work in any web browser, desktop or mobile - and for an added bonus see how these can be compiled and flashed on tiny microcontrollers to be played on small, arduino-based custom built gaming rigs.\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/Singapore-JS/events/241600740/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/8iKa/"
