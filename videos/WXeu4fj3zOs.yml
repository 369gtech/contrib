description: "http://www.Cppcon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2015\n—\nLambdas (even those mysterious generic lambdas) are just syntactic sugar atop constructs that are perfectly understandable when approached from the right direction.\n\nWe'll start with the implementation of C-style functions, then move to overloading, function templates, non-static member functions, C++11 lambdas, and then demystify C++14 generic (\"auto\") lambdas. Finally, we'll detour into the implementations of std::function and std::bind to show how they're different from lambdas.\n— \nArthur O'Dwyer worked for many years at Green Hills Software, making the world's most optimizing C and C++ compilers. Now he works at Mixpanel in San Francisco, where he organizes a monthly C++ meetup.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
