recordingDate: 1506508568
description: "Commerce 2.0 is the result of a two and a half year development process. It removes the need for over half of the most popular Commerce 1.x contrib modules, mainly through better architecture and a better understanding of needed features. What did we learn along the way?\n\nHow we leveraged core APIs, and helped build them\nHow we chose which battles are worth fighting\nHow we optimized for developer happiness\nWhere it went right and where it went wrong\nHow many laptops were stolen, lost, and destroyed along the way.\nAfter this session you will have a better overview of how Drupal 8 can help you write better applications, how Commerce 2.x can help you create better eCommerce sites, and how you can be a better developer in general."
