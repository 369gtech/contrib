description: "Deep Dive: Network Service Mesh BoF - Ed Warnicke, Cisco & Frederick F. Kautz IV, Red Hat \n\nIn this talk, you will learn about some of the Advanced Network Application Design Patterns that Network Service Mesh enables. Network Service Mesh (NSM) is a novel approach solving complicated L2/L3 use cases in Kubernetes that are tricky to address with the existing Kubernetes Network Model. Inspired by Istio, Network Service Mesh maps the concept of a service mesh to L2/L3 payloads. The NSM architecture can be naturally extended to allow interaction of the NSM with the physical network enabling cloud providers to offer value-add services like: Connecting a customers Pod(s) to a network egress specific to that customer Introspecting the Network Service Mesh control messaging to adapt the physical network to serve customer needs better. Allowing customers to request specific physical network services. The NSM community has developed several design patterns for solving problems in K8s that may be of utility to others working in other problem domains in K8s. This talk discusses those design patterns and their benefits. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/Grdj"
