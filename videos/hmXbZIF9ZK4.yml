description: "Talk \nData labeling is a tedious yet necessary task to train Machine Learning models. This iterative process alternates data labelling and model training. That’s what Active Learning is tackling. We present “cardinal”, a package that relies on interpretable metrics to help selecting the most representative samples while minimizing selection bias. We prove performances similar to state-of-the-art methods\n\nSpeaker\nMachine learning researcher with a taste for unsupervised methods, weak supervision, and human in the loop learning. I did my PhD at Inria on an extension of dictionary learning to multi-subject estimation in large cohorts in order to generate functional segmentations of the brain. I have spent 3 years at Criteo maintaining and developing the recommendation platform. I am now research scientist at Dataiku where I lead the active learning efforts.\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
