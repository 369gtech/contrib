description: "Knowledge of the neighborhoods may identify deficient services to a marketing company, it also enables you to address your spouse’s inquiry about points of interest on a day-trip. To acquire such knowledge, you need a rich source of data with decent API. OpenStreetMaps offer both. This talk explains how to access the data points in OSM and how to query their labels and content using two Python libraries (overpass and overpy) as well as the underlying OSM query language.\n\nhttps://pydata.cz/\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.
