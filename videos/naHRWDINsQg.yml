description: "Speaker: SJ & Menaka Priyadharshini, Pixel Onion\n\nIn technical camps, most sessions cover topics which may be baffling for beginners who just pick up Drupal. It is more interesting to tinker with the cutting edge technology than sharing the basic Drupal development. But everyone starts his / her career as an inexperience developer, and there are definitely beginners and hobbyists among the participants.\n\nThis session will cover the speaker's journey towards mastery in Drupal specifically and web programming in general. He will also share the setup for local development environment.\n\n-   How to start easily with Drupal\n-   The one thing considered as taboo in Drupal development\n-   Two main security issues to watch out for when coding\n-   Resources for continuous learning\n-   Short demonstration of local development environment\n\nAbout SJ\n\nBeing passionate and proficient in technology in general, SJ has his mission in life to help others use technology to better everyone's life. For the past decade, he chooses Drupal as his tools of choice to bring about transformations in client organisations he works with. When not busy tinkering with Drupal or building the local Drupal community, he likes to spend quality time with his wife and kids to explore Singapore and the world, to build Gundam model kit, and to play board games.\n\nEvent Page: https://www.drupalcamp.sg/\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\nRecorded by: Zion Ng"
