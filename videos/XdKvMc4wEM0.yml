description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nNoise Cancelling Headphones for Fluent Bit - Powered by Lua - Matt Lehman & Guillermo Menjivar, GreyNoise Intelligence Inc.,\n\nThis session will demonstrate how to use Fluent Bit to rapidly prototype IP address enrichment and filtering techniques. You will learn how to write a Lua filter plugin for Fluent Bit, how to use 3rd party Lua modules, and how to add a Lua test harness. Anyone that has plugged a device directly into the internet and checked their logs has wondered “what is all this activity?”. Matt runs a global network of hundreds of sensors at GreyNoise, so he sees this “internet background noise” daily and thinks about how to deal with log volume, enrichment, and routing a lot. If you work in a security operations center, site reliability engineering, or data engineering, this session will show you how to reduce log volume within your organization by tuning out the noise."
