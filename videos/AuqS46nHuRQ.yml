description: "With 4.5 million downloads last year, the Groovy programming language is used by hundreds of thousands of developers worldwide. But how do those developers use and write Groovy code? What should \"idiomatic\" Groovy code look like? What are the best practices for syntax style and typing preferences? What are the nice shortcuts to be aware of to be more productive with Groovy? This session’s speaker answers these questions, gives you some good hints, and shares knowledge from his 12 years of Groovy experience.\n\nSpeaker:\nGuillaume Laforge, Product Ninja and Advocate at Restlet, Restlet\nAt Restlet, Guillaume Laforge is taking care of the Product Leadership around the APISpark API management platform, the Restlet Studio for crafting Web APIs and the Restlet Framework for authoring restful applications.
