description: "“Brand-new shiny” project(s), no legacy, everything being built and designed from scratch….\nDream scenario, isn’t it? Well, it can be a nightmare when under this description is hidden a few-years-old project that is still under construction and can’t be used by businesses/users even though it’s kinda “working.” Yep, this means a lot of mess and a few more years of addressing legacy code even before going to production. Yay, what fun! But even if you’re lost in the darkest forest, there is hope. Always. This session covers the sins that lead to situations such as no product vision, gold-plating, and too big a backlog and prescribes cures for them."
