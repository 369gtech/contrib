Based on our experience extending a private docker image registry (Project Harbor) to a Helm Chart registry. We'll share some of the key issues we see in Helm Chart management in an enterprise, such as RBAC, signing, vulnerability scanning, and how we provide a integrated user experience in managing/inspecting Helm Charts with docker image management. We'll also discuss the challenges we are seeing in this journey, and the possible solutions.\n\nFor more info click here: https://sched.co/FuJj"
