(That and dialyzer, but there are limits!)\n\nSo we did what any sensible company would do, and hired \"\"\"\"the Purerl guy\"\"\"\" and set about working out how we could use the Purescript to Erlang compiler he'd written to help us with this. To that end since, we have already shipped two products and quietly open sourced a selection of the libraries we have built on top of Purerl to support those endeavours.\n\nIn this session we'll start by looking at the super happy path (our ideal world) for end-to-end Purescript before going into detail on how some of it is implemented, the weak spots and pitfalls currently present and some of the huge hacks that are possible when using Purescript FFI to bind against \"native Erlang\" libraries.\n\nSlides & full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/rob-ashton/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - ROB ASHTON\n(Barely) Functional Developer\n\nRob has spent about a decade of building software commercially in a plethora of languages and technologies as well as leading enterprise teams, engaging in the odd spot of consultancy and travelling around as a jobless wanderer whilst learning all the way along. \n\nNow he can be found mostly writing Erlang and Purescript, building distributed media delivery systems for a small b2b company in the UK and also helping to develop an ecosystem around Purerl for the masses.\n\nMore on Rob Ashton: https://codesync.global/speaker/rob-ashton/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE MESH LDN 19\nCode Mesh LDN is powered by Code Sync.
