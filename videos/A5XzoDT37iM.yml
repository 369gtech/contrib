description: "Making your site more accessible can be a daunting task. If you are approaching accessibility for the first time, the sheer breadth of the topic can leave you wondering where to start - after all, working to accommodate a diverse range of abilities means there are a correspondingly diverse range of issues to consider.\n\nThis talk will explain how to effectively review a site for accessibility and how to build accessibility considerations into your team process so each team member knows their role, and has the appropriate training material. The goal is for attendees to walk away with an actionable process which they can immediately use to assess and improve their products' accessibility and overall user experience.\n\nSee all the talks from Google I/O '17 here: https://goo.gl/D0D4VE\nWatch more Android talks at I/O '17 here: https://goo.gl/c0LWYl\nWatch more Chrome talks at I/O '17 here: https://goo.gl/Q1bFGY\nWatch more Firebase talks at I/O '17 here: https://goo.gl/pmO4Dr\n\nSubscribe to the Google Developers channel: http://goo.gl/mQyv5L\n\n#io17 #GoogleIO #GoogleIO2017"
