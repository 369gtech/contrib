Blockchain is one such technology that works on distributed shared ledger encompassing ability to share a ledger that is updated, through peer-to-peer replication, every time a transaction occurs. It works on decentralized virtual network making Transactions secure, authenticated & verifiable. Tampering with a record or cybercrime is practically impossible in Blockchain & no central authority controls it. It promotes distributed transactions which are secure, unalterable, transparent and easy to audit. Blockchain works on Permission & consensus with potential to revolutionize the way business is conducted."
