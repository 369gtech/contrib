description: "If you identify as Black and would like to share your story, I am opening this platform for you. You can share your joy for creative coding and software development and teach the audience about something you love to make with code. You can address your lived experience with anti-Blackness and racism in the tech community. The Coding Train is offering stipends and production support.

Welcome a “Guest Conductor” episode of The Coding Train! This series will highlight others in the community doing work to expand fields of art, technology, education, and activism through a combination of guest videos, tutorials, and live streams. I recognize that there are barriers of access to technology and anti-blackness within the tech community. I believe Black Lives Matter and this series will be one of many ways in which the Coding Train will amplify black voices and perspectives. By attempting to extend this platform beyond me, The Coding Train will offer opportunities for others to share their stories openly and teach something they love to make or explore with code.\n\nToday, I’m thrilled to bring to you Nelson from Amigoscode. Nelson is on a mission to teach you code! As a software engineer, he shows you how to code *real* projects and learn the skills companies are looking for! Thousands of students have taken his free courses for beginners and professionals. He runs a Facebook Group and Discord with more than 5 thousand people learning how to code.\n\n-------------------------\n🚂 Website: http://thecodingtrain.com/ \n💬Discord: https://discord.gg/hPuGy2g\n💖 Membership: http://youtube.com/thecodingtrain/join\n🛒 Store: https://standard.tv/codingtrain\n📚 Books: https://www.amazon.com/shop/thecodingtrain\n\n🎥 Coding Challenges: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZiZxtDDRCi6uhfTH4FilpH\n🎥 Intro to Programming: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA\n\n🔗 p5.js: https://p5js.org\n🔗 Processing: https://processing.org"
