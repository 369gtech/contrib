recordingDate: 1581886460
description: "The microservice revolution gave us independent development and deployment of small chunks of code. In return we got a new set of problems, among them flaky integration tests and fear of breaking neighboring services. To the rescue: Consumer-driven contract tests!\n\nThis hands-on talk will give you the general theory as well as concrete examples using Pact, a popular multi-language contract testing tool.\n\nPia Fåk Sunnanbo\nOmegapoint\n\nRecorded at Jfokus 2020 in Stockholm 5th of february\nhttp://www.jfokus.se"
