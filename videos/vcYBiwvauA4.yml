title: 'AI that Dresses Itself'
language: English
recordingDate: 1542617769
description: "A team of researchers at Google Brain and Georgia Tech developed an AI that learned how to dress itself using various types of clothing. They demonstrated their technology by presenting a video that shows an animated figure gracefully putting on clothing, and the most interesting part is that it learned how to do this by itself. The technique they used was called Trust Region Policy Optimization and its one of the techniques at the forefront of AI research. I'll admit that this was one of the most difficult papers I've ever read, if not the most difficult. The Differentiable Neural Computer paper would be a close 2nd. Using code, animations, theory, and memes, I'll explain how this algorithm works and demonstrate how we can use it to improve our lives in the areas of gaming, elder-care, and factory automation. \n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/AI_Dresses_Itself\n\nPlease Subscribe!
