language: English
recordingDate: 1544209054
description: "Michael Muller is often referred to as “the most successful photographer you’ve never heard of”. Closing in on three decades of shooting, Michael’s body of work crosses over every aspect of pop culture. From A-list actors and musicians to sports stars; and product advertising ranging from Nike, Range Rover, Oakley, Redbull, Four Seasons, Turkish Airlines, Kodak, and a growing list of other Fortune 500 companies.\n\nMichael will share what it takes to make it to the top — and stay there — in the challenging world of professional photography. He’ll breakdown some of his client work and personal projects and examine how the two worlds intertwine with one another.\n\nMichael will also take a look at motion and its role in the world of photography, not only with advertisers but in fine art too. He’ll touch on his app, photoschool.com, and how tools such as this help artists adapt to the changing climate and culture. Lastly, Michael will talk on the importance of “giving back”.\n\nMichael Muller\nMULLER PHOTO INC.\nhttps://instagram.com/michaelmuller7/\nhttps://vimeo.com/user1595638\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Muller_(photographer)\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
