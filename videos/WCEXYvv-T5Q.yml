title: 'Liz Sander - Software Library APIs: Lessons Learned from scikit-learn - PyCon 2018'
recordingDate: 1526159793
description: "Speaker: Liz Sander\n\nWhen you think of an API, you’re probably thinking about a web service. But it’s important to think about your developer interface when designing a software library as well! I’ll talk about the scikit-learn package, and how its API makes it easy to construct complex models from simple building blocks, using three basic pieces: transformers, estimators, and meta-estimators. Then I’ll show how this interface enabled us to construct our own meta-estimator for model stacking. This will demonstrate how to implement new modeling techniques in a scikit-learn style, and more generally, the value of writing libraries with the developer interface in mind.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2018 and https://github.com/PyCon/2018-slides"
