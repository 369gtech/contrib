title: 'Azure Blockchain – Create and deploy multi-party applications with Workbench'
recordingDate: 1531740927
description: 'Blockchain is a disruptive technology trend that enables the fiercest of competitors to collaborate without trusting each other. It uses a secure, distributed ledger to establish a shared view of a cross-organizational business process and can track the movement off assets across company borders. Azure is building a blockchain platform for creating, configuring, and querying blockchain-enabled smart contracts that leverage both “traditional” cloud middleware and a suite of new Azure capabilities to support blockchain development and is introducing a developer tool, Azure Blockchain Workbench to vastly simplify development and accelerate time to value for those getting started with blockchain.'
