language: English
recordingDate: 1478851923
description: "Is the life without database possible? Come and see how group of alien developers created the system with just plain clean Java. Poor guys forgot to even think about a database… Come and see what might happen if You do not have database and the power goes down. What if the system needs to be restarted and extended? What about concurrency and performance? Come, listen and you will never want to use any database again :-)\n\nJarek Ratajski\nJava Developer since 1999. I love programming since my first line of code I did on the C64 in Basic. I have 15 Years experience developing JEE software working for various companies and customers such as Capgemini, Lufthansa, ZDF, Uniqa. Now I work for CSS Versicherung in Luzern. I like to do shows - presenting the things just as they work – with live coding, demos and hacking. From CSS/JavaScript via Scala/Java/Akka down to CPU/GPU. So: expect everything.\n\n[GDZ-1171]"
