We'll look at live malware demos, go through the tools of the trade and learn the basics of malware reverse engineering.\n\nAntti Tikkanen is the Director of Security Response at F-Secure Corporation. His team analyzes malware for desktop and mobile platforms, written in languages ranging anywhere from C to AutoLISP. Antti started at F-Secure nearly a decade ago, working in the team that built the world's first commercial rootkit scanner for Windows. \n\nToday he still enjoys spending his time digging through rootkits and other interesting samples to better understand what the online criminals are up to.\n\nSeen at Reaktor Dev Day 2013\nreaktordevday.fi\nblog.reaktordevday.fi"
