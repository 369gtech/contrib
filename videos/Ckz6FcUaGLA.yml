description: "Traveling through a secure API in Python\n[EuroPython 2021 - Talk - 2021-07-30 - Ni]\n[Online]\n\nBy Jessica Temporal\n\nI like to remember the places I have been and I always liked the idea of having a map of those places, so as any developer would do, I built a web application for that.\n\n\nIn this talk, we will see how you can use Python and Auth0 together to build your very own \"Where Have I Been\" map! I will walk you through all the steps we will need starting from scratch. From building the first API endpoints, protecting the endpoints that create new markers, all the data manipulation, and even deployment!\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\n\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2021.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/"
