description: "Google Tech Talk\nJuly 28, 2010\n\nABSTRACT\n\nPresented by Ryan Dahl, the creator of the node.JS open source project.\n\nIt is well known that event loops rather than threads are required for high-performance servers. Javascript is a language unencumbered of threads and designed specifically to be used with synchronous evented I/O, making it an attractive means of programming server software.\n\nNode.js ties together the V8 Javascript compiler with an event loop, a thread pool for making blocking system calls, and a carefully designed HTTP parser to provide a browser-like interface to creating fast server-side software. This talk will explain Node's design and how to get started with it."
