language: English
recordingDate: 1447405617
description: "What should a good REST API look like? Should you use verbs or nouns in your resource paths? How do you handle versioning of APIs? How to deal with partial responses and pagination? Which status codes should I make use of? What about sorting, filtering, and searching? Have you thought about content negotiation, cross-domain access, hypermedia, and authentication?\n\nGuillaume will got through all these topics, offering advice on the best approaches to those questions, and opening up the debate on the various options available, so as to make your Web API at REST, as clean and elegant as possible."
