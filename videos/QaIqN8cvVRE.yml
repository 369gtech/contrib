title: 'DEF CON 29 BIC Village - Ochaun Marshall - The OPSEC of Protesting'
language: English
recordingDate: 1630570098
description: 'Technology both facilitates and complicates the human condition in many ways, especially in the tradition of protesting. Activists and those supporting social movements need to be aware of the risks of social demonstrations. In this talk, we dive into communication strategies for activists, as well as the basics of OPSEC. We’ll do threat modeling against both nation-state & opposition movements and discuss the utility of basic security hygiene in this context. We will also examine these principles against case studies of the Civil rights movement, BLM, Hong Kong Separation movement, Election protests, and recent “hacktivist” attacks against Parler and Gab.'
