description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nCRI-O: The Runtime Control Room - Sascha Grunert, SUSE, Peter Hunt, Urvashi Mohnani, Mrunal Patel, Red Hat \n\nThere are many ways to customize the underlying container runtime in Kubernetes. Where Kubernetes API offers many knobs for tuning your workloads, using CRI-O gives you access to even more. CRI-O is a container runtime that provides an incubation space for new runtime features in a secure way. It exposes lower-level features with container annotations, runtime classes, and configuration variables, giving admins control over how and when these features are available, and paving a path for their eventual stabalization and wider adoption in Kubernetes. Join the CRI-O maintainers Peter Hunt, Sascha Grunert, Urvashi Mohnani and Mrunal Patel as they give an introduction of CRI-O and walk through the features and knobs CRI-O exposes. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ekGC"
