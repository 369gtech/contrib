description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM V 2020 - https://codesync.global/conferences/code-beam-sto/\n\nMore great virtual tech conferences - https://codesync.global \n\n---\n\nBoost your productivity with the Erlang Language Server\nby\nRoberto Aloi\n\nABSTRACT\nImplementing features such as auto-complete or go-to-definition for a programming language is not trivial. Traditionally, this work had to be repeated for each development tool and it required a mix of expertise in both the targeted programming language and the programming language internally used by the development tool of choice.\n\nA brilliant intuition, the \"Language Server Protocol\" (LSP), changes the rules of the game. A real blessing for the Erlang community.\n\nOBJECTIVES\nClarify what a language server is\nPresent the challenges around implementing a language server\nDiscuss the Erlang LS architecture\nGet users!\nGet contributors!\nInspire the Erlang Community to create tools\n\nTARGET AUDIENCE\nAnyone who feels the Erlang Community is lacking tools and IDEs\nDevelopers who want to boost their Erlang productivity\nPeople who want to understand more about language servers\nAuthors of tools which they believe should be utilized more by the Erlang Community\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - Roberto Aloi\n\nPassionate about Erlang and property-based testing, Roberto has been working with Erlang technologies since 2007. Sicilian by origin, he is now based in Stockholm where he works as a software engineer at Klarna, providing a smooth purchasing experience to 85 million consumers from 205,000 stores in 17 markets.\n\nThe original author of tryerlang.org in a world where Docker containers did not exist yet, Roberto is now working on an Erlang Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation in his not-so-copious spare time.\n\n---\n\nCode BEAM V\nWebsite: https://codesync.global/conferences/code-beam-sto/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/CodeBEAMio"
