description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nHow to Work in Cloud Native Security: Demystifying the Security Role - Justin Cormack, Docker \n\nWorking in security can be intimidating and the shortage of people in the space makes hiring difficult. But especially in cloud native environments, security is something everyone must own. If you’ve ever asked yourself, “what does it take to work in security in a cloud native environment? How can you move into security from a dev or an ops position? Where should you start and what should you learn about?” then this talk is for you.  Justin Cormack, Security Lead at Docker and member of CNCF SIG Security will share his personal experience gradually moving from ops to dev to security, the reasons for his transitions, and what he learned along the way. He will break down why security really is one of the most interesting and different areas to specialize in and why working in security might be for you.\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zeiz"
