description: 'With number of requests growing, asynchronous style of writing applications is gaining popularity. We will go though the evolution steps of future in Java. Java 5 had Future, but it was blocking and to address it''s limitations 3rd party libraries, such as Guava, provided their own Future abstractions. Except being not standardised, they had several drawback, that we will take a look at. Everything changed with Java 8 release which brought to us CompletableFuture. Does it need any improvements? In end of this talk, we will take a look at Scala Future and see how it compares to CompletableFuture. Also we will shed some light on other methods for managing asynchronous computations.'
