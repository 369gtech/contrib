description: "Vitaly Friedman - on future adventures in front-end\nYou’re a smart cookie. If someone asks you to build a responsive accordion, you’ll figure it out. The same goes for a table. Or a calendar. Or, God forbid, a multi-level-mega-drop-down. But how would you go around slightly more complicated components? \n\nWhat if you had to build a sophisticated car configurator with a real-time updated 3D view? What about an advanced feature comparison table, a music festival schedule, an election map, an airfare booking and check-in, a live world football championship leaderboard and a theatre map seat selection? In this session, we’ll take a microscopic examination of common interface components and problems appearing in responsive user interfaces — and we’ll look into simple art-direction techniques to create unique and memorable experiences. \n\nTighten up your seatbelt! Beware: you will not be able to unlearn what you’ll learn in the session! Ah, one more thing, take the techniques with a grain of salt — we do not take responsibility for sleepless nights and nightmares caused by the content of this session.\n\nSlides: https://www.dropbox.com/s/zxgkbfflz3a8ys0/coldfront-design-patterns.pdf?dl=0"
