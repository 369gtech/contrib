description: "From OSCON 2015 in Portland: Openness is good for Government on many levels — open data, open standards, open source, open markets. Where we set the way we work in Government, it’s important to let industry determine the technical standards we work with. We can’t do everything ourselves and by making our own code and data open we have an opportunity to gain from innovation as well as support other services to be developed by suppliers of all sizes.\n\nMake things open, it makes things better.\n\nAbout Hadley Beeman:\nHadley Beeman is an architect for open data and open standards. She is an advisor on technology policy and is active in the U.K. Government and W3C. She is also the co-founder of @300_Seconds.\n\nClick here to browse other keynotes, interviews, demos, and tradeshow videos from OSCON Portland 2015: https://goo.gl/vD6vda\n\nWatch more from OSCON 2015: https://goo.gl/vD6vda\nFind out more about OSCON: http://oscon.com/open-source-2015\nDon't miss an upload!
