title: 'Leveraging Scala Macros for Better Validation'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433259309
description: "Data validation is a common enough problem that numerous attempts have been made to solve it elegantly. The de facto solution in Java (JSR 303) has several shortcomings and fails to leverage the powerful Scala type system. The release of Scala 2.10.x introduced a couple of experimental metaprogramming features, namely reflection and macros. This session introduces macros by way of a practical example: implementing Accord, a full-blown data validation engine, utilizing def macros and a Scala DSL to enable elegant validator definition syntax and call sites.\n\n\nAuthor:\nTomer Gabel\nA programming junkie and computer history aficionado, Tomer's been around the block a few times before settling at Wix as a system architect. In the last couple of years he's developed a major crush on Scala, promoting it within the Israeli software industry as part of Java.IL (Israeli Java user group) and Underscore (Israeli Scala user group) and organizing the annual Scalape√±o conference in Tel-Aviv.\nView more trainings by Tomer Gabel at https://www.parleys.com/author/tomer-gabel\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
