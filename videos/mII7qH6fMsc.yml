title: 'Observability Via RED in the Age of Kubernetes'
language: English
recordingDate: 1579816786
description: "Kubernetes has become the de-facto technology for container orchestration, powering some of todayâ€™s most advanced and complex systems. K8s gives DevOps teams the flexibility, agility, and speed they need to refactor their applications as they shift to microservices and cloud-native technologies. These more sophisticated systems, however, bring new challenges as DevOps teams now have less useful visibility into their systems to explore, understand, and answer the problems that cloud-native complexity brings. The layers of abstraction and constant churn associated with K8s make observing and understanding your system one of the biggest challenges with adopting Kubernetes at scale.\n\nWith RED (rate, error, and duration) metrics, you can observe your system via multiple dimensions. RED gives you the framework to build alerting, monitoring, and analysis into a flexible structure to meet the emerging needs of Kubernetes environments and enables you to focus on what matters most. You can stay on top of the overall health of your system and yet retain the ability to dive deep into the data. Furthermore, with observability tools such as SignalFx Kubernetes Navigator, you now have turnkey, enterprise-grade, and AI-driven options to cut through the noise and quickly get started with RED observability.\n\nJoin Dave McAllister, Technical Evangelist at Splunk and Jeff Lo, Director of Product Marketing at Splunk as they walk through the impact of RED, observability and Kubernetes, with examples of the clear benefits adding depth to your monitoring can bring."
