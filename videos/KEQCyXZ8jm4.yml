description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nKubernetes as a General Purpose Control Plane: Scaling on Kubernetes - Hasan Turken, Upbound \n\nKubernetes style APIs are becoming popular as it works great as a general purpose control plane. One can build operators on top of it to declaratively manage resources living outside of the cluster.  But how to scale when we want to run multiple isolated instances of such an operator? Do we really need a full fledged Kubernetes Cluster for each or can we run only a subset of control plane components by considering we are managing external resources?  In this talk, we will discuss the minimal control plane components when we want to use Kubernetes as a general purpose control plane. Building on top of that, we will propose a lightweight solution to run multiple isolated control plane instances as tenants on a single Kubernetes Cluster. At the end, a live demo will be shown that provides a practical example of the solution proposed.\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zens"
