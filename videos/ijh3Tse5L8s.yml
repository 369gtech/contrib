description: "http://CppCon.org\nGilang Hamidy “Crafting Embedded Domain-Specific Language (EDSL) In C++ using Metaprogramming, Operator Overloading, and Lambda Expressions”\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2018\n—\nEver thinking of creating your own specific-purpose programming language? Or maybe improving programming experience by adding a language feature in existing language? This talk presents about Embedded Domain-Specific Language (EDSL) from basic concepts and technique to build it using C++. \n\nEDSL is a powerful technique in integrating a custom libraries or frameworks in users’ codes. EDSL can improve user’s experience in using libraries by reducing boilerplate codes and providing more readable and straightforward codes. Some success stories are: Boost.Spirit, Boost.Proto. \n\nAlthough Boost.Proto provides tool to build EDSL in C++, this talk presents building EDSL from the ground up utilizing operator overloading, template metaprogramming, and macro. We use operator overloading and template metaprogramming to build a simple expression tree for our EDSL. \n\nThis talk provides an example of developing an “asynchronous block” within C++ codes to be used in Tizen native application development. The “asynchronous block” has similar purpose with C++11 std::async but targeting a different API and mimicking the structure of try-catch block. \n— \nGilang Hamidy\nEx Engineers, Currently Studying\n\nGilang Hamidy was an Engineer from Samsung Research Indonesia. He was in charge to lead Tizen native application development to support Tizen launch in Indonesia from 2016 to 2017. He initiated Tizen Fundamental Classes (TFC) as a framework libraries to support developing Tizen native app using C++. He presented TFC in Tizen Developer Conference (TDC) in San Francisco 2017. TFC itself is published as open-source in GitHub. He and his team successfully developed several applications including: Samsung Gift Indonesia, several 3rd party Indonesian news apps, and Telegram client for Tizen. \n\nPrior to working at Samsung, he was a Technology Consultant at Accenture from 2011 to 2014. He graduated from Universitas Indonesia majoring in Computer Science in 2011, and will begin his master studies in Security and Cloud Computing at Aalto University, Finland, in Fall 2018.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
