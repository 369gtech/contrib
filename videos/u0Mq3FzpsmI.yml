description: "Hey ninjas. In today's JavaScript tutorial, we'll be taking a look at what variables are from a birds eye view. Variables are at the heart of most programming languages, and JavaScript is no different in that respect. \n\nVariables area a way of storing information (such as the pixel position of an element on a page, or the customer name, or email) and can be of any of the main JavaScript types (integers, strings, boolean values etc - we'll cover these later).\n\nWe need to use variables in our JS programs, so that we can refer to different pieces of varying information for different parts of our scripts to run! For example, an image slider needs to store how many images are in the slider.\n\nAs always, fire away with any questions :).\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO CHANNEL - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n========== JavaScript for Beginners Playlist ==========\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9i9Ae2D9Ee1RvylH38dKuET\n\n========== CSS for Beginners Playlist ==========\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gQeDH6xYhmO-db2mhoTSrT\n\n========== HTML for Beginners Playlist ==========\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9ibZ2TSBaGGNrgh4ZgYE6Cc\n\n========== The Net Ninja ============\n\nFor more front-end development tutorials & to black-belt your coding skills, head over to - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg or http://thenetninja.co.uk\n\n========== Social Links ==========\n\nTwitter - @TheNetNinja - https://twitter.com/thenetninjauk"
