description: 'Cloudera’s Data-in-Motion team is adopting Flink to complete its platform for collecting, processing and analyzing event streams. In working with our customers we find that an increasing number of enterprises implement streaming first solutions, where insights are delivered in near real-time. In this talk, we discuss the enterprise requirements for an end-to-end streaming platform and Flink’s role in our vision for it. We share usage patterns where our customers are interested in using or are already using Flink in production.'
