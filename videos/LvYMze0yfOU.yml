What happens when charities and volunteer data scientists work together? What can charities achieve through data science, and what kind of data science is the most useful to the sector? This talk will present the work that DataKind does and give various examples of data for good projects weâ€™ve worked on. We hope it will inspire you to use your skills in service of improving the world we live in, by helping those who do that every day.\n\n - Captured Live on Ustream at https://www.ustream.tv/crunch"
