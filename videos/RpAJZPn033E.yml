description: "Evaluating Users’ Perceptions about a System’s Privacy: Differentiating Social and Institutional Aspects\n\nOshrat Ayalon, Tel Aviv University\n\nSystem design has a crucial effect on users’ privacy, but privacy-by-design processes in organizations rarely involve end-users. To bridge this gap, we investigate how User-Centered Design (UCD) concepts can be used to test how users perceive their privacy in system designs. We describe a series of three online experiments, with 1,313 participants overall, in which we attempt to develop and validate the reliability of a scale for Users’ Perceived Systems’ Privacy (UPSP). We found that users’ privacy perceptions of information systems consist of three distinctive aspects: institutional, social and risk. We combined our scale with A/B testing methodology to compare different privacy design variants for given background scenarios. Our results show that the methodology and the scale are mostly applicable for evaluating the social aspects of privacy designs.\n\nView the full SOUPS 2019 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsoups19/technical-sessions"
