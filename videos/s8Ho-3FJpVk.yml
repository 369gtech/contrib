description: "Time to do some testing and try to break something. I will be testing with BrowserStack and a device connected directly to my computer. Chrome dev tools allow you to forward a port from a computer to a connected device. This comes in handy when trying to test locally.\n\nI have also included an interview I recorded at SyntaxCon with Kim Crayton.\n\nSee a professional front-end developer at work. Unscripted. Mistakes included.\n\nTest Site: https://test.catechetics.com\nRepo: https://github.com/fus-marcom/ci-react\n\nReact: https://facebook.github.io/react/\nNext.js: https://github.com/zeit/next.js/ \nMaterialize: http://materializecss.com/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/JesseRWeigel\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/c/JesseWeigel29 \n\nCode Editor: https://atom.io/\nTerminal: https://www.iterm2.com/\nProject Management: https://trello.com\n\n-\n\nLearn to code for free and get a developer job: https://www.freecodecamp.com\n\nRead hundreds of articles on programming: https://medium.freecodecamp.com\n\nAnd subscribe for new videos on technology every day: https://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=freecodecamp"
