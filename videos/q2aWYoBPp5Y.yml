language: English
recordingDate: 1573500204
description: "When someone like Reid Hoffman streams a live video on LinkedIn about a popular topic like startups, tens of thousands of viewers will watch it concurrently. Typically, hundreds of likes on the video will be distributed in real-time to all of these viewers. That amounts to a million likes/second distributed to viewers per live video. How do we make this massive real-time interaction possible across the globe? In this talk, I’ll do a technical deep-dive into how we use the Play/Akka Framework and a scalable distributed system to enable live interactions like likes/comments at massive scale. \n\nAbout:\n\nAkhilesh Gupta, Sr. Staff Engineer, LinkedIn\n\nAkhilesh is the technical lead for LinkedIn's Real-time delivery infrastructure and LinkedIn Messaging.
