description: "Sven Dowideit\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/194/\n\nI was roped into helping FollyGames, an emersive theatre and performance group, to build distributed actuators to add to their experiences.\r\nInitially, to rescue a performance at the Museum of Brisbane, using Raspberry pi's, audio and NFC, and then over time, adding neopixels, UHF RFID, buttons, motors, servos and more.\r\nIn and attempt to head off the joys of last minute ideas, I've been leaning heavily on using WEMOS Mini's and the shields that you can buy on aliexpress\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
