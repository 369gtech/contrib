description: "Panel Discussion: Multi-Tenancy in Kubernetes: Current State and Future Roadmap - Sanjeev Rampal, Cisco; Ryan Bezdicek, Cray Inc.; Erica von Buelow, Red Hat; and Tasha Drew, VMware \n\nKubernetes doesnâ€™t currently formally support the notion of multi-tenancy. However, many companies today are using Kubernetes to provide ad hoc multi-tenant solutions, to share kubernetes cluster resources between multiple independent teams. In this panel, we will have a discussion with a mix of experts on this topic including panelists from kubernetes users, open source community contributors, vendors and providers. The panel will discuss both soft and hard multi-tenancy models and will cover solutions that are available today (such as pod security policies and rbac) as well as new features being developed by the community Multi-tenancy working group and related work such as Kata containers. Importantly we will have an open discussion between panel members and audience on requirements and issues related to end to end aspects of multi-tenancy in real world deployments. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPcY"
