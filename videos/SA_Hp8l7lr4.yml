description: "Help! My app bundle is 5MB! My users are angry that my app is so slow! Itâ€™s easy to forget that performance matters when we are under pressure to deliver features quickly.\n\nWe'll talk about bleeding-edge topics in front-end performance such as dual-bundles for modern browser transpiling.\n\nCome learn how to deliver better user experience with high-performing front-end apps using Webpack. This talk is library-agnostic (React, Angular, Vue, etc.)"
