description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nMultiple Networks for Kubernetes Workloads - Piotr Skamruk, CodiLime & Doug Smith, Red Hat \n\nEmbark on a tour of CNI multiplexers -- an adventure in attaching multiple network interfaces to pods. We'll show the advantages of each and provide examples to get you started using them. We'll also talk about the history and future of multiple network attachments in Kubernetes. Kubernetes is based on simplicity, and Kubernetes networking is no different-- simplicity is king. Each pod is given a single IP address, and a single network in which “everything sees everything”. This model is not always what consumers expect, especially for high performance networking. In this world we need to have network isolation (to isolate traffic between control & data planes) or to have multiple interfaces in pods. This provides operators better control over functionality, latency and throughput. We'll make sure you're geared up for the adventure with CNI multiplexers and multiple network attachments! \n\nhttps://sched.co/UabS"
