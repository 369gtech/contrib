description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nFrom Villains to Heroes: How an Improved DX Has Made Our Devs Happy-ish- Patricia Gaughen & Ana-Maria Cālin, InfluxData\n\nDeveloper Experience or DX is one of those terms that has become a dirty buzzword in recent years. Dirty because we all try to provide a good DX but we rarely achieve it. And as system engineers, we know that devs can be a tough crowd to please at times. In late 2019, InfluxData launched their Cloud 2.0 time-series database - a SAAS offering running on top of Kubernetes that is continuously delivered, with multiple commits landing in production daily. Since then, they’ve added several regions and Cloud providers, in addition to deploying many more services. Ana and Pat’s team support a wide variety of devs - from UI to low-level storage devs with different levels of Kubernetes knowledge. This talk will describe their journey going from villains to heroes - changing the way their devs test application code deployed with Kubernetes. They’ll share how transitioning from using local `kind` and Docker Engine for testing software changes, to using a dedicated remote Kubernetes cluster with garden.io and telepresence.io made their devs happy. They’ll also provide technical details of the setup and how their solution addresses the 4 different pillars of a good DX: “Function”, “Stability”, “Ease of use” and “Clarity”."
