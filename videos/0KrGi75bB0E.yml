In this talk we will present an overview of the current design and implementation of the new wire protocol (the protocol used for communication between pairs of daemons and daemons and clients), named Messenger V2, that aims to overcome the limitations of the current protocol.\nWe will start by describing the current wire protocol design and pinpoint its limitations, which will pave the way to present the new protocol features.\nThen we will present the details of the new protocol design and talk about some of the possible future features that can be implemented by extending the base protocol. \n\nRoom: H.1308 (Rolin)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 16:30:00+01"
