title: 'CON1859   Build and Monitor Cloud PaaS with JVM’s Nashorn JavaScripts'
language: English
recordingDate: 1449594410
description: "Sure, it is easy to use a web interface to build, manage, and monitor your cloud PaaS instances, but it can be much easier to reuse several Java libraries, do REST calls, and leverage your PaaS SDKs with the Nashorn JavaScript engine. In this session, you will learn how to code useful Nashorn JavaScripts to automate all the boring tasks you used to do in your browser. You will see examples for creating instances, diagnosing their health, scaling your infrastructure up and down, and building a JavaFX interface without compiling a single line of code—using just Nashorn. Say goodbye to Bash scripts. It’s time to code JavaScript in your UNIX box.\n\nSpeaker:\nBruno Borges, Principal Product Manager, Oracle\nBruno Borges is Oracle’s Principal Product Manager for Fusion Middleware, Java, and Oracle Cloud, as well Developer Advocate for the Java platform and Oracle Cloud platform. Bruno has more than 15 years of experience as a Java developer in several areas, from mobile to enterprise applications."
