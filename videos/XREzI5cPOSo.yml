title: 'Steven Lembark - "Having a Meta-Adventure"'

description: 'The MadMongers decided to write Adventure in Perl as an exercise in parsing and data-driven code. Then they had to test itâ€¦ Writing tests for all of the ghosties and tolls, weapons and toys would have left them all typing forever. Using metadata-driven testing and a sacred bottle of Perl we generated thousands of tests just by rubbing our magic keyboards! This talk describes the basics of metadata-driven testing, how Object::Exercise uses the data, and how to look at defining tests with data.'
