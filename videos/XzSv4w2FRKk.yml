description: 'Whenever a functional language is mentioned, everyone talks about typical applications like DSL, parsing, data mining, or scientific computing. But what about mainstream consumer-facing applications? Can you build your next project with Scala? What if your system must run in the cloud, on desktop computers, and on specialized hardware, can you still do it? We’ll share our experience of implementing such a system for a German fitness startup that utilized custom-built devices, biometrics, cross-platform integration, and, of course, Scala. We’ll discuss the challenges we ran into and pitfalls you can avoid when your team decides to go functional.'
