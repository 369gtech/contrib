title: 'The First IoT JSR: Units of Measurement by Werner Keil/Mohamed Taman/Otávio Santana'

recordingDate: 1447526249
description: "Come to meet JSR 363 - Units of Measurement! It's the first JSR targeted to help you work with IoT devices, tackling sensors and measurements in a standard way. We all know that when representing a temperature, for example, we normally have it as a float. But, is this float in Celsius? Fahrenheit? Kelvin? This is one of the problems this JSR wants to solve: have all \"real world\" value and unit data represented in a standard way. This JSR is also very suitable for scientific applications, where data representation, conversion and formatting is very important.\n\nIn this presentation, we'll see how both developers and platform providers can leverage this JSR, coding for a smart home or smart gas pump that reports its values in a standard way. As well as other use cases and actual embedded devices like Raspberry Pi or Intel Edison.\n\nAnd this JSR is still in the making. Be first hand witness of the JSR 363 Public Draft (due around Nov) and learn how YOU can get involved and help Java grow in the IoT space! We'll explore how JSRs work and how you can get involved in the JCP and work with this and other JSRs."
