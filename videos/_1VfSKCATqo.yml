description: "The CEO has three main functions: \n1. get the people on the ship chart the\n2. ship's course and make sure that you\n3. have enough fuel to cross the ocean now\n\nBut unless you're actually building a boat this is an analogy. People, vision and money are the three most important things and if you're doing anything else outside of these three things, you're probably stretching yourself too thin as a founder.\n\nSo, let's start with people: they are going to be your founding team. Itâ€™s like a marriage. The founding team has to have the same commitment and so it's absolutely important that you are very careful about who you go into this union with.\n\nThen vision. It's a North Star you know as engineers we come in and we solve problems but we forget that what we're actually solving a problem for is some kind of business value or something we're trying to guide our company towards. Having that vision and just repeating that over and over again is absolutely critical.\n\nFinally, capital. The key thing here is that when somebody gives you money generally, they're not just handing you a bag of money. Generally, they want that money back and they want something on top of that maybe. And once you are on that treadmill, it's hard to get off.\n\nYet, whether you're part of a larger organization or you're starting your own company, you're here to create, and that's one of the beautiful things about being an engineer. It's also a very beautiful thing about being a founder because you're creating something out of essentially nothing, and it's really an incredible feeling. \n\nWe are pioneers."
