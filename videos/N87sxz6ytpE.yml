title: 'Patterns for Resilient Architecture - Adrian Hornsby'
recordingDate: 1550588687
description: "We have traditionally built robust software systems by trying to avoid mistakes and by dodging failures when they occur in production or by testing parts of the system in isolation from one another. Modern methods and techniques take a very different approach based on resiliency, which promotes embracing failure instead of trying to avoid it. Resilient architectures enhance observability, leverage well-known patterns such as graceful degradation, timeouts and circuit breakers and embrace chaos engineering, a discipline that promotes breaking things on purpose in order to learn how to build more resilient systems.\n\nIn this session, will review the most useful patterns for building resilient software systems and I will introduce chaos engineering methodology and especially show the audience how they can benefit from breaking things on purpose.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
