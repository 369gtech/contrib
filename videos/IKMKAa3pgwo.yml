description: "Google Faculty Summit 2010\r\nJuly 29, 2010\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nPresented by Dirk Balfanz.\r\n\r\nPasswords can leak through a variety of channels: users tend to re-use passwords across web sites, get phished, attacked by malware, etc. Most would agree that password-based authentication is not very secure. So why do we still live in an online world dominated by passwords? In my talk I will point out some of the challenges we face when moving away from password-based authentication. I will explain what roles OpenID and OAuth play in this move, security issues we faced in the past with these protocols, and where we're headed in the world of \"Internet Identity.\""
