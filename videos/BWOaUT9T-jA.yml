description: "Code Mesh London is the best place in Europe for non-mainstream tech and programming languages. On 4-5 December 2013 over 50 inventors and originators of the most innovative languages and technologies of the moment shared their experience with 200 attendees. Topics included Scala, Haskell, Clojure, Erlang, Elixir, Julia and much more. See you at Code Mesh 2014! codemesh.io/\n\nAbout the talk:\nIn recent years Complex Event Processing (CEP) has been becoming more mainstream. Most however use CEP for processing near real-time data exclusively though. CEP has however other uses especially in Event Sourced systems namely that it can be used as a query language for temporal correlation queries as well as machine learning. This session will look at a language that does just this and how it can be used to scale to millions of events/second.\n\nTalk objectives:\n\n- Look at using CEP as a querying model for historical data"
