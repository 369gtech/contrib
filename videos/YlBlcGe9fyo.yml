description: "From Strata + Hadoop World 2015 in London: At Google, few things are so pervasive as Bigtable, the famous wide-column NoSQL database. It lies behind nearly every major Google product (Gmail, YouTube, Google Analytics), with its own class of internal memes, and a resource footprint unmatched anywhere else in the world. In the vibrant OSS community it is the forebear for a whole class of extraordinarily popular projects, including HBase, Cassandra, Accumulo, and Hypertable. This battle-hardened, embarrassingly-powerful system has seen constant improvement over the last 10 years and is about to take a brand new leap in its evolution.\n\nSponsored by Google\n\nAbout Cory O'Connor (Google):\nCory is a product manager on Google Cloud Platform’s storage team in Mountain View, focused on releasing Google’s techno-wizardry on an unsuspecting world. Before Google, Cory worked in cybersecurity, designing the machine learning systems supporting real-time fraud detection for the social web at Impermium (acquired by Google). Prior to rejoining the world of high-technology, Cory lived his life as a rocket/satellite scientist, building probabilistic and event-based simulations of complex aerospace systems.\n\nHe finds himself to be enthusiastic, in one way or another, about nearly everything.\n\nVisit Strata Conference: http://strataconf.com\n\nBuild Data Skills with O'Reilly Video Training: http://goo.gl/a4G9st\nSurbscribe on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/OreillyMedia\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/strataconf\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/OReilly\nGoogle+: https://plus.google.com/+oreillymedia"
