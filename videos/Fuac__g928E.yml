description: "Search service, price service, risk service – when you model them as services, you end up with a tangled web of dependencies between them and almost all the other services in your system – a horrible distributed monolith.\n\nThere’s a reason for that – they were never meant to be services in the first place. Join Udi for a blast from the past looking at how rules engines can fit in the missing dimension of your Microservice architectures. Things will look very, very different."
