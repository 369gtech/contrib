description: "Per Liden, Consulting Member of Technical Staff, Oracle\n\nThe Z Garbage Collector (ZGC) is a new JDK garbage collector designed for low latency and high scalability. For an industry-standard latency-sensitive benchmark, it achieves throughput over 36% higher than the existing JDK collectors do while never exceeding a maximum pause time of 2 milliseconds. This session explains how ZGC achieves this performance and shows how to use it."
