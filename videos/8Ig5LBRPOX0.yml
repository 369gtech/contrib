description: "Devices (phones, tablets, etc.) already consume most services/data, but they have to get those services somewhere! In this session, learn how to use proven patterns & open source software to quickly and effectively build edge services - API gateways - that marshal & streamline communication between your key services and end-users with devices in hand. This session addresses vital points such as:\n\nConfiguration services\nMicroservice registration and discovery\nCircuit breakers for graceful degradation\nLoad balancing and intelligent routing\nAsynchronous messaging\nLeveraging OAuth2 for service security\nAdditional topics discussed include logging & tracing, testing approaches, and migration patterns.\n\nThe presenter will demonstrate how to develop & manage microservices & expose them via an edge service, securely, using OSS tools employed by Netflix to keep movies streaming globally 24x7."
