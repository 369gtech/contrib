title: 'Getting Started In Modeling With Couchbase Mobile'
recordingDate: 1326434065
description: "It can be very liberating to store your Couchbase app's data as free-form dictionaries, free of the rigid schema of a relational database. But there's a lot to be said for the syntactic comforts and conveniences of modeling your data as native Cocoa objects with predeclared @properties, the way CoreData does. Don't fret - the CouchCocoa framework lets you do both, even in the same database. During this webcast I'll show you how to acquire the glamor of an object model, while still letting your NoSQL freak-flag fly.\n\nPrerequisites:\n\n   - Knowledge of Objective-C and Cocoa foundation classes\n   - Slight acquaintance with Couchbase Mobile or CouchDB\n   - Flawless skin and a Body Mass Index below 18\n\nAbout Jens Alfke:\n\nJens Alfke is a Mobile Engineering Peer at Couchbase, Inc. where he's developing Couchbase Mobile for iOS. He has a long history as a Mac developer and spent 15 years at Infinite Loop working on everything from AppleScript and Stickies to iChat and Safari RSS, followed by two years at Google and RockMelt extending the Chrome browser. He's an avid proponent of decentralized social software, despite never having managed to release any. In his spare time he pretends to be a DJ, and cuts things out of plastic with lasers.\n\nProduced by: Yasmina Greco"
