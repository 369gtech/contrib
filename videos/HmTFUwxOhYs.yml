language: English
recordingDate: 1553603585
description: "The world is full of planning problems, such as the Vehicle Routing Problem and Employee Rostering. And humans aren’t very good at planning them efficiently. Constraint solving algorithms do a much better job: they reduce expenses, minimize fuel consumption and improve employee retention.\n\nIn this technical session, I’ll explain the use cases, the basic code, the nuances of hard and soft constraints, incremental score calculation, continuous planning and real-time planning.\n\nOptaPlanner is an open source constraint solver in Java that is used across the globe by governments, nonprofits and companies ranging from startups to Fortune 500 companies."
