Estimation is today one of the preferred methods for decision-making as well as the evaluation of the release dates of our projects ... but today there is an alternative: no longer estimating our tasks!\n\nThis talk is feedback on the implementation of #noEstimates on a development team for over a year. You will see what are the keys as well as the tools needed to set it up.\n\nJulien Topçu \nFrom Société Générale & OWASP fundation member\nSenior Lead Developer for Société Générale, I'm an active evangelist on \"value creation\" focused methodologies, such as DDD/Hexagonal Architecture, l'XP and Kanban #NoEstimates.\n\nAs an OWASP fundation member, I strive to convey the DevSecOps mindset to the community. I set up several Continuous Security pipelines at companies scale."
