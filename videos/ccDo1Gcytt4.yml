recordingDate: 1638872693
description: "—\niOS 15 brings exciting opportunities for making our apps even smarter. With CreateML made available on iOS devices, we can now train our own machine learning models dynamically. In this talk, we will see how we can build our own custom image filters, using cool technologies such as CreateML, CoreML, SwiftUI and Combine. We will also see what are the benefits of on-device training over sending the data to a server.\n\nСсылка на презентацию: https://downloads.ctfassets.net/2grufn031spf/5MevvjlAbQU5O9enlTvzmc/67e49bb8e32ff0a58f6040023d0a6e3d/Martin_Mitrevski_Training_dynamic_ML_models_on_iOS_15_2021_11_19_01_47_10.pdf"
