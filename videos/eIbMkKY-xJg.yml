description: "SVG is the old new hot thing on the web today; we’re seeing it everywhere. Despite being around for quite a very long time, we’re only getting to know SVG today and finding new things about it every day.\n\nGetting started working with SVG may seem overwhelming at first. Where do we start? There are different ways to embed an SVG, so which one should we choose? What about browser support for SVG? How well does it work with CSS?\n\nIn this talk I want to give you an overview of how to get started working with SVG. We’ll go over several point from creating and exporting SVGs, optimizing them, embedding them, providing fallback for non-supporting browsers, dealing with CSS, and much more!"
