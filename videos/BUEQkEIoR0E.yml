description: "Python meetup by Point Nine 23.10.2018\n\nCloverETL is a graphical ETL tool which has proven to be very efficient in creating workflows for processing transactions for the purpose of regulatory reporting (EMIR and MIFIR).\n\nPoint Nine has extended CloverETL to integrate Python into the loop, so we can run more complex queries, business logic and advanced analytics procedures outside CloverETL, which is written in Java.\n\nBy combining Python with an ETL platform such as CloverETL, we benefit from both the ease with which we can implement complex logic in Python and leveraging the built-in functionality for standard data manipulation and automating the pipeline in Clover. We can focus on solving challenges that matter and can streamline the rest."
