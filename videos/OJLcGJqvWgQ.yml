title: 'YOW! 2014 Edward Kmett - Functionally Oblivious and Succinct'
recordingDate: 1514466904
description: "This talk provides a whirlwind tour of some new types of functional data structures and their applications.\n\nCache-oblivious algorithms let us perform optimally for all cache levels in your system at the same time by optimizing for one cache for which we don’t know the parameters. While Okasaki’s “Purely Functional Data Structures” taught us how to reason about asymptotic performance in a lazy language like Haskell, reasoning about cache-oblivious algorithms requires some new techniques.\n\nSuccinct data structures let us work directly on near-optimally compressed data representations without decompressing.\n\nHow can derive new functional data structures from these techniques? Applications include just diverse areas as speeding up something like Haskell’s venerable Data.Map, handling “big data” on disk without tuning for hardware, and parsing JSON faster in less memory.\n\nEdward spent most of his adult life trying to build reusable code in imperative languages before realizing he was building castles in sand. He converted to Haskell in 2006 while searching for better building materials. He now chairs the Haskell core libraries committee, collaborates with hundreds of other developers on over 150 projects on github, builds tools for quants and traders using the purely-functional programming-language Ermine for S&P Capital IQ, and is obsessed with finding better tools so that seven years from now he won’t be stuck solving the same problems with the same tools he was stuck using seven years ago.\n\nFor more on YOW!
