But in reality, building diversity and inclusivity and fostering the ability to incorporate junior engineers go hand-in-hand. Engineering teams should approach each of these efforts in service of the other.\n\nTogether, we'll articulate the value of investing in mentorship efforts in terms of their impact on the ability to attract and retain diversity. You will walk away with a clearer understanding of the connection between the two efforts, and ideas for incorporating mentorship and D&I processes at your place of work."
