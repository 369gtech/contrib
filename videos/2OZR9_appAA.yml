No external libraries, easy enough to understand by students new to programming. Extendable with colours and animations for more advanced students and creative coding. How? Bitmaps!\n\n-------\nMariusz Różycki\nSoftware Engineer, working primarily with C++ and Rust, currently affiliated with a food delivery company (who would have thought it was such a hard problem?). Nearly 10 years after making his childhood hobby into a career, still tries to have fun writing code.\n\n-------\nC++ on Sea is an annual c++ and coding conference, usually held in Folkestone, Kent in the UK. The 2020 & 2021 conferences were moved to virtual events due to social distancing requirements.\n\nProduced and Edited by Digital Medium Ltd: https://events.digital-medium.co.uk\nEnquiries: events@digital-medium.co.uk"
