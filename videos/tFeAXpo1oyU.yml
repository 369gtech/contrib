description: "DevSecOps: It’s Not Me or You, It’s WE!\n\nAlan Shimel, Editor-in-chief, DevOps.com\n\nPanel discussion featuring:\n\n1) Anders Wallgren - CTO, Electric Cloud\n2) Paula Thrasher - Director Digital Services, CSRA\n3) Rob Stroud - DevOps Analyst, Forrester\n4) John Willis - VP of Devops and Digital Practices, SJ Technologies\n5) Caroline Wong - VP Security Strategy, Cobalt\n6) Shannon Lietz - DevSecOps Leader and Director, Intuit\n\n- Hosted by Alan Shimel\n\nThe rapid growth of the DevSecOps community is proof that while Dev and Ops practitioners are keen to include the cybersecurity community, the cyber community would like to see more secure apps as well. But what is really driving the growth, here? \n\nWhile tools are certainly important, as in most things DevOps, getting anything done correctly often requires a change in the way you think about solving the problem. Instilling a culture of “security is everyone’s responsibility”, is the key to a successful DevSecOps program. \n\nWhile this may sound simple, changing cultures is never as easy as it sounds. In DevSecOps, we are dealing with long standing customs and ingrained behaviors that sometimes work against our success.\n\nHow do we convince the security team that they are not the only ones who care about security? That by going faster with automation teams can actually increase compliance and security? And how do we show the developers, the DevOps team, QA and others that security is not just the job of the security team, but it is their job and responsibility too? That the security team really don’t want to be the people who say no (or do they?).\n\nContinuous Delivery must also include continuous security.\n\nCase studies show us that if we can have everyone adopt this mindset, we can do more, faster and more securely. We can have it all. Join us in this panel discussion where we will talk about how to instill this culture in your own organization. Tips that will allow you to be successful with DevSecOps, as well as some discussion of tools that can help.\n\nIf developing secure code and maintaining secure apps is important to you, don’t miss this session!\n\nDOES17 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
