description: "Ixchel Ruiz, Principal Consultant, Trivadis AG\n\nDetecting problems ASAPand getting feedback—the right kind of feedback—with a cost-effective solution is neither complicated nor trivial. This session describes the adventure (laughs, tears, and war cries) the speaker faced when schema migration became an issue in her team’s last project. Docker, Team City, Liquibase, Flyway, PostgreSQL, and H2 are some of the technologies they used and learned to either love or tolerate."
