description: "How big can you go with a low-code tool like APEX? Ask Jessica Giddens, Seattle-based senior manager of internal tools and solutions for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. Her team of two senior developers and two recent college graduates—who learned APEX on the job—has built a number of enterprise systems that Oracle relies on.\n\nCreated in 2016, the Elevated Support Portal (ESP) is “a one stop shop for all things related to OCI industry and regulatory compliance,” says Giddens. “It was purpose-built to solve that fundamental problem that we've all faced: ‘How and where do I get the information I need? And how do I get it quickly?’” As a customer- and partner-focused team, “We ourselves know how important it is to have access to that information. And as a producer of that type of data, we wanted to easily share it with the field teams. So, we used APEX and thus ESP was born.”\n\nIn this interview with Oracle developer content maven Alexa Morales, learn how Giddens's team creates low-code apps that are functional, beautiful -- and popular.\n\nChapters:\n0:00 Intro\n0:25 How we found out about the ESP app\n0:37 What is ESP?\n1:20 What kind of compliance documentation does the field sales team need?\n2:00 The reports and collateral feature\n2:12 Using Redwood style\n2:27 What is the technical stack?\n3:02 What kind of results are you getting?\n3:30 The FAQ feature with hundreds of question-and-answer pairs\n4:16 Tuning what you're offering based on page click metrics \n5:18 What results have you achieved by using APEX?\n6:26 The evolution of understanding of APEX from free add-on tool to full developer tool\n7:06 How Jessica manages APEX developers\n8:26 How the team delivers faster thanks to APEX\n\n#APEX #AppCreatorSpotlight"
