description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTOpia Chicago 2021. #GOTOcon #GOTOpia\nhttp://gotochgo.com\n\nJames Bowkett - Lead Consultant at OpenCredo\n\nABSTRACT\nSo you’ve made the enlightened choice to use Kafka in your architecture, and you know you need to provision your cluster using infrastructure as code (IAC), but why stop at just provisioning brokers?\nIn this talk we will explore the available options to make deploying your Kafka-based applications more repeatable, resilient and observable. We’ll look at specific examples and techniques for applying IAC to the following areas :\n• Topic and partition creation\n• Secrets management\n• Configuration options\n\nI’ll also share some lessons I’ve learned related to tooling, monitoring and backup management. And finally we’ll look at some resilience do’s and don’ts with some specific examples of where these tools have helped, and where their absence has hindered [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n02:16 Kafka - what's the difference?\n03:49 Key concepts\n07:30 What can I DevOpsify?\n10:40 What are the options?\n11:21 Bash\n12:17 Terraform\n13:33 Kafka config manager\n14:47 Secrets management\n16:48 In an ideal world\n18:33 In a k8s-native world\n20:27 Backups\n21:54 Backup options\n25:37 What about application parameters?\n31:20 Monitoring\n35:18 Monitoring tooling\n36:33 Tooling - commercial\n37:14 Tooling - open source\n38:01 Key takeaways\n40:12 Outro\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotochgo.com/2021/sessions/1758/kafka-devops-and-resilience-for-all\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nLiz Rice • Container Security • https://amzn.to/3oU4iJe\nLiz Rice • Kubernetes Security • https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/kubernetes-security/9781492039075\nBrendan Burns, Joe Beda & Kelsey Hightower • Kubernetes: Up and Running • https://amzn.to/3wrtwlp\nChris Richardson • Microservices Patterns • https://amzn.to/2SOnQ7h\nJohn Arundel & Justin Domingus • Cloud Native DevOps with Kubernetes • https://amzn.to/3hKZvI5\nMichael Hausenblas & Stefan Schimanski • Programming Kubernetes • https://amzn.to/3qTvKch\nSam Newman • Monolith to Microservices • https://amzn.to/2Nml96E\nSam Newman • Building Microservices • https://amzn.to/3dMPbOs\nRonnie Mitra & Irakli Nadareishvili • Microservices: Up and Running• https://amzn.to/3c4HmmL Mitra, Nadareishvili, McLarty & Amundsen • Microservice Architecture • https://amzn.to/3fVNAb0\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#ApacheKafka #Kafka #DevOps #Resilience #IAC #Bash #Terraform #Kubernetes #k8s #MirrorMaker\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
