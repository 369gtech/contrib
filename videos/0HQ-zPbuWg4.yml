description: "Carlos Pereira Atencio\n\nHave you ever been curious about how device drivers control the hardware in your computer, phone, or IoT widget? Have you always thought you would needed to learn C or other low-level language to write a driver? Thanks to MicroPython we can control the physical world with Python code!\n\nMicroPython is a lean an efficient implementation of the Python 3 programming language for microcontrollers and constrained environments. Thanks to MicroPython we can use Python to control embedded devices, allowing us to prototype faster, release to market sooner, provide more engaging computing education, or simply have more fun!\n\nIt’s never been easier to adventure in the embedded space, and using a familiar language is a great advantage. It’s incredible that we can simply “upip install” a module to control our brand new sensor, display, controller, etc; but how does it work? Or what do we do if there isn’t an existing library available?\n\nThis talk will focus on the basic concepts needed to understand how your code can make something move, how these hardware devices operate and how do they electrically talk with each other. It will provide simple examples showing how easy it is to do all this in Python, and a few tips on what to do when things go wrong."
