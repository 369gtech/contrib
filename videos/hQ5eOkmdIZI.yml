description: "Hosting your Geo Data, an Overview of Design Options\r\nMano Marks (Google)\r\n\r\nIn this session, we will talk about various options for hosting your Geo data, including Google App Engine. We will outline different design patterns, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of each, and show code samples. Specifically, we will look at storing Geo data as static files, in databases, and extracting Geo data from Google properties, such as Calendar and Spreadsheets.\r\n\r\nThis will be a higher level talk, focusing on overall design. However, some knowledge of scripting languages and databases would be helpful, as well as a basic understanding of KML and the Google Maps API."
