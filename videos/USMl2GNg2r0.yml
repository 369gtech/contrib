description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2015\nSpeaker: Will Tran\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/securing-microservices-with-spring-cloud-security-53170178\nThis talk will walk through the authentication and authorization scenarios that you may encounter once you start building out microservices. We'll go over OAuth2, OpenID Connect, and how to leverage those standards with Spring Cloud Security, so you can build out secure services that can be easily consumed by both Spring and non-Spring clients."
