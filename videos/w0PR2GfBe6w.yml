description: "Recorded at SpringOne Platform 2016.\nSpeakers:  Eric Bottard & Ilayaperumal Gopinathan\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/orchestrate-all-the-things-with-spring-cloud-data-flow\n\nWhat do things like Minecraft, a light bulb and your music library have in common? Well, nothing really. Until you come up with this crazy idea to link them together. This is where application orchestration comes in.\n\nIn this session, you’ll learn how Spring Cloud Data Flow allows easy composition of microservices together. As the spiritual successor to Spring XD and the natural sidekick of Spring Cloud Stream, Data Flow has been thought as a way to deploy, run and manage loosely coupled apps in the cloud."
