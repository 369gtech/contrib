title: 'DEF CON Safe Mode Red Team Village - Erdener Uyan, Gökberk Gülgün -Executing Red Team Scenarios'
language: English
recordingDate: 1597807914
description: "Red Team activities are undoubtedly one of the fastest developing solutions against the cyber attacks of today. In this talk, we'll take a look at our work on an open-source proactive machine learning powered automation tool that performs red team simulations. This automation tool provides the opportunity to try out all available attack scenarios, thereby helping the community, especially organizations, to develop mechanisms to protect against these attacks before attackers do. Currently, red, blue and purple teams are improving day by day with the contributions made by open source. We will demonstrate the scenario playbook developed to collect the scenarios prepared for the red, blue and purple team on a single scenario place. The aim of this playbook is to protect the systems from such attack vectors, to examine the attack scenarios, to protect their systems by viewing the protection mechanisms and to contribute to these scenarios. With the built-in Scenario Place, people can either run these scenarios or check the scenario configurations on their systems. All scenario titles are prepared in accordance with MITRE and Cyber Kill Chain.\n\nAll scenarios from various teams such as Atomic Red Team, Mitre and TIBER-EU are fed into the application as input."
