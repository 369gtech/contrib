description: "Speaker: Li Hongyi\r\n\r\nLearn how we launched Parking.sg, all the way from the initial prototypes to the final production deployment. We walk through the various stages of app development, while taking dives into some of the product, engineering, and even bureaucratic design decisions we made along the way.\r\n\r\nAbout Hongyi:\r\nHongyi leads a team of engineers, designers, and product managers who build technology for the public good. Projects they work on include Parking.sg – an app to replace parking coupons, and Data.gov.sg – the government’s open data repository. He believes in working on real problems, building for the user, and pushing for change.\r\n\r\nPrior to joining the government, Hongyi worked at Google on the distributed databases and image search teams. He previously attended MIT where he obtained degrees in computer science and economics. In his free time he works on personal projects like typographing.com and chatlet.com\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/Junior-Developers-Singapore/events/252272100/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/kTYl/"
