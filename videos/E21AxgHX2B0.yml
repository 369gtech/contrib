description: "The talk from QA Fest conference in Kyiv, Ukraine.\nPresentation: https://bit.ly/2zsNWjY\nFb: https://www.facebook.com/QAFest/\nWebsite: http://qafest.com/\n\nAlmost any application or software system manages data. It is hard to imagine test automation that is not affected by this fact. There are many differenct approaches how to prepare system under test, providing predefined test data: use application UI, invoke API methods, run business logic directly, access DB from test scenarios, etc. In this talk we will review most of existing approaches, starting from the easiest and the most popular ones and finishing with really tricky ways to manage your test data for large distributed systems. There is no ideal solution for every case or silver bullet, but I hope your toolset will become wider after visiting this talk."
