description: "Haisoo Shin, John Stuppy, Jon Boekenoogen \n\nBuilding a mobile commerce Android app isn't just a matter of putting pictures of your products in a ListView and adding a buy button. More so than any other type of mobile apps, time is money. The longer you make a user wait or the more time you make them spend filling out forms will decrease the chance of the user finishing their transaction. Plus whenever you're talking about accepting payments, you must think about security as well. Learn some of the techniques and tips from the Google Wallet team and from one of our partner on how you can make your mobile commerce apps easier and more secure to use, and thus increase your conversions and ultimately your bottom line. This session will include some intermediate/advanced Android development topics.\n\nFor all I/O 2013 sessions, go to https://developers.google.com/live"
