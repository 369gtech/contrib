description: 'Making your own beer and wine is actually quite easy. We''re pretty new at it ourselves but have managed to successfully brew drinkable beverages. We''re brewing 1-2 gallon batches of beer in our tiny NYC kitchen and also making fruit and honey wines. You don''t need a lot of space or fancy equipment. We''ll walk through the process (with pictures) and make equipment recommendations as well as give tips based on our experiences. If you''re lucky (and we''re allowed) we might even bring samples (assuming the samples last until the time of the talk).'
