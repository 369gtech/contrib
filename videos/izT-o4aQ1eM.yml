description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM SF 19 http://bit.ly/2T3Do0U\n\nGet involved in Code Sync's next conference http://bit.ly/2Mcm4aS\n\n---\n\nCOMPOSING IN STYLE\n\nby Robert Carbone\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nStyled \nText \nControl\n\n\nTALK LEVEL: Beginner\n\nABSTRACT\nComposing In Style Intro to wxErlang's StyledTextCtrl — Can you remember typing into a text box? What would you build if you had the ability to create your own? WxErlang's most sizable module, wxStyledTextCtrl(wxSTC), is equipped to fashion the powerful & colorful text box you desire. With 400+ functions & 26 events, wxSTC is the entire Scintilla source-code-editor neatly (text)boxed up. This talk simplifies this maze of a module by showcasing features & discussing their design. By the end, you'll be line-marking, autocompleting & of course, stylin' text.\n\nRead the full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/robert-carbone/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - ROBERT CARBONE\nEdited wxErlang Libraries\n\nRobert Carbone has always had an affinity for keyboards - acoustic & digital. Fluent in music theory, graphic design and armed with a Masters of Accountancy,  his passion lies in the valuation of intangibles — more specifically,  analyzing & graphically representing them in conceptual frameworks. \n \nHis journey to develop wearable tech led him to Erlang. Once he got deeper into coding, he recognized a need to make the  wxErlang Libraries more accessible to the community. \n \nRobert is currently spearheading the hack of wxErlang's 230+ modules. His recurring code and tutorial publications can be found on ScriptCulture.com.  ScriptCulture was founded to elevate awareness of Erlang code &  the art of calligraphy and, ultimately, to introduce both into  academic curriculum.\n \n When he isn't being an evangelist for Erlang you will find him longboarding around a city,\n snagging a disc(frisbee) or composing, at a keyboard.\n\nMore on Robert Carbone: https://codesync.global/speaker/robert-carbone/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM SF 19\nCode BEAM SF is powered by Code Sync.
