title: 'Maven - your ultimate CD tool by Jakub Marchwicki'

description: "Maven. Everybody uses it. Everybody hates it (classic love hate relationship). Embracing it ain't easy - but once done, it becomes a golden hammer.\n\nThis title is a bit flame'ish - for a reason. In this showcase session I'll complete a continuous delivery pipeline of a multi module project with pure Maven (+ plugins). Once that is done - adding a Jenkins (I mean a scheduler) is as easy as 1-2-3.\n\nSo if you've been using Maven a bit but never gave it enough time - this is a talk for you!\n\nJakub Marchwicki has been around software development for past 10 years, wearing multiple hats, getting hands dirty in multiple environments, securing both technical as well as the business side of The Thing. “An engineer with a human friendly interface?”. Some languages, some frameworks, blah blah blah - doesn’t matter. Jakub always considered programming as a tool to solve real-life problems - in a pragmatic way. He always stayed closed to business side of the solution, still focusing on the technology. He combines daily job of managing a horde of software engineers at Young Digital Planet with lectures and technical trainings and comittment to Gda?sk Java User Group.\n\n[GLJ-8229]"
