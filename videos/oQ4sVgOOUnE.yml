description: 'Abstract: Suddenly, networking is cool again.  Routing requests and managing traffic in a distributed, microservices application is hard, with many dead ends along the way.  In this session, Owen will explain how networking has grown in importance, discuss some of the approaches that have been tried by the industry, and help you to find the right approach for your application needs.  Weâ€™ll finish by looking at some of the emerging technologies that are turning traditional approaches to networking upside down.'
