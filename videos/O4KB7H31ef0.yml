description: "Geek Girl Meetup Öresund, a network for women with passion for technology, digital media & entrepreneurship, invites you to an exciting evening on password security. \n\nPasswords are one of the most common attack vectors of today. Humans tend to choose very bad passwords, mainly due to bad guidance. The old ”eight characters, a symbol, a capital and a number” recommendation is utterly outdated, and those passwords are cracked\nwithin seconds. \n\nBut how can we create good, unique passwords that are easy for humans to remember but hard for computers to guess?\n\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry in the Malmö/Lund region. Foo Café is aimed at those interested in sharing, learning and creating. \nJoin the fun at foocafe.org"
