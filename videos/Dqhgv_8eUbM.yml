description: "This session will be a fun, entertaining and enlightening session from the Virtual JUG Java Council Jedis, Martijn Verburg, Trisha Gee and Simon Maple. Oh and there will be beer to make it even more fun, entertaining and enlightening. You'll see blind ignite talks covering 40 years of Java, rockstars on stage playing 'Just a minute', interviews with top Java leaders and lighthearted panel discussions. Come for the beer, stay for the tech laughs.\n\nIf you enjoyed the JavaPosse roundup at Devoxx in previous years, this is a must see!"
