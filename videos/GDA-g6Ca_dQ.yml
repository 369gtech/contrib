title: 'Mobile Apps with ClojureScript - Jearvon Dharrie'
recordingDate: 1447712449
description: "React Native enables us to build native mobile apps with JavaScript. Amazing work is being done to pair React Native with ClojureScript. ClojureScript is receiving lots of attention because of how well it pairs with React. Being able to use ClojureScript with React Native opens new doors for developers and the language. The following topics will be discussed: What is React Native?, How does the marriage of the two work? and advantages and disadvantages. The audience will learn about React Native and how to get started with Ambly and ClojureScript.\n\nAbout the speaker: Jearvon Dharrie is a software engineer at Comcast. Jearvon spends his day working with Ruby, and the JVM. In his free time he enjoys toying with programming languages. He is currently interested in Clojure and ClojureScript."
