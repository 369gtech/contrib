title: 'Authoring ARM templates the easy way with FARMer - Isaac Abraham'
recordingDate: 1596747841
description: "Don't forget to check out our links below!\nhttps://ndcoslo.com/\nhttps://ndcconferences.com/\n\nAzure Resource Manager templates have made repeatable deployments on Azure a reality. However, the true cost of these templates is the cost of authoring them, generally involving painstaking and error-prone management of JSON files.\n\nWhilst improvements in tooling have helped ameliorate this problem, there's a need to rethink how we create ARM templates, which is where the FARMer project comes in.\n\nIn this session you'll be exposed to the following:\n\n* Learn about the basics of ARM templates and the value proposition behind them\n* Understand the cost of working with ARM templates\n* See how we can use a .NET domain specific language (DSL) to rapidly author and work with ARM templates.\n* See common use cases and cost-benefit of ARM templates\n* Look at ways of dealing with elements such as parameterisation and variables through a programming language rather than through JSON and stringly-typed expressions\n* Discuss how to deploy ARM templates through repeatable continuous integration and deployment tools"
