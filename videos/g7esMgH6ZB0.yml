title: 'Production Ready Streaming SQL with Ververica Platform'
recordingDate: 1603993975
description: "Ververica Platform is a turnkey solution for the adoption of Apache Flink in enterprise environments. It significantly eases the deployment and life-cycle management of Flink stream processing applications. The community edition of Ververica Platform is freely available and can be used for commercial purposes.\n\nThe latest release of Ververica Platform added support for Flink SQL. Now you can develop, deploy, and manage Flink streaming applications that are defined by SQL scripts. The web-based SQL editor with a catalog browser and query preview execution makes the implementation of continuous SQL queries super easy. A suite of packaged storage system connectors, including Apache Kafka, JDBC databases, file systems, Apache Hive, and Elasticsearch, empower you to move your data in real time to the place where you need it. Sophisticated UDF management ensures that you can solve your use cases with all the custom logic that you need. And of course, most features of Ververica Platform that are available for traditional JAR deployments are supported for SQL deployments as well.\n\nIn this video, I show how Ververica Platform enables you to leverage Apache Flink as an enterprise and production-ready SQL engine. I will run you through a real world use case and present the SQL features of the platform."
