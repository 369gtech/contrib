description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nIntro: vSphere Cloud Provider and CSI - Fabio Rapposelli, VMware \n\nKubernetes cloud providers and volume plugins used to be \"in-tree\" meaning that their source code is included in the main Kubernetes repo. They were compiled in, and shipped only in a Kubernetes release. The drawbacks of this monolithic approach were that Kubernetes was larger than needed, and feature + patch activity was locked to Kubernetes release schedules. Going forward, new features are exclusive to the new replacements: an out-of-tree vSphere cloud provider + a CSI storage plugin. Legacy implementations remain for the short term but are destined for deprecation. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Uajd"
