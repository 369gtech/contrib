title: 'DrupalCon Nashville 2018: What mix of DevOps "things" is right for my needs?'
recordingDate: 1523470335
description: "Navigating all of the DevOps tools and techniques available can be a daunting task, even for the most seasoned DevOps engineers. The DevOps landscape is always evolving -\_new tools surface, old tools get either out-performed or un-supported, tried and true tools gain new features and new footing.\_\n\nThe goal of this session is to surface\_the best mix of DevOps \"things\" that are a best (or close to best)\_solution for\_real-world development team scenarios.\n\nWe will cover some basic topics, define some some common use-cases, then\_apply DevOps approaches that would best fit the technical and business needs in the scenario.\n\nTopics:\n\nIdentify common \"needs\" profiles (e.g., independents,\_Agencies, single dev teams, enterprise dev teams)\nIdentify common\_\"scope\" profiles (e.g., single project, many projects, complex product w/ integrations)\nIdentify common DevOps tool\_implementation profiles (e.g., self-hosted, SaaS models, hybrid solutions)\nDefine environmental considerations (e.g., dev staff skills, time / budget constraints, legal requirements)\nDefine common Software PM methods (e.g., Agile / Scrum, Kanban, Waterfall, Giddy-up Cowboy, Eyes Wide Shut)\n\n\nLevel of knowledge required\_\n\nSome technical knowledge of N-tier web application architecture.\_\n\nIf I lost you with that sentence (it really dates me), the following roles will find value in this talk:\n\nTechnical Project Managers\_\nDev / IT Departmental Leads\nAgency tech folks\nBusiness / Technical Analysts\nDevelopers\n\n\nTakeaways\n\nHave a method to articulate different DevOps approaches independent of tool names. Tool examples will be provided.\nHave terms and terminology that can resonate beyond the DevOps engineers. (i.e., The People With The Money)\nHave some sense of what \"recipe\" of tools and DevOps solution is close to your needs as a starting point.\n\n\nAimee Degnan (CEO / Principal Architect of Hook 42) is a self-labeled\_curmudgeonly old Enterprise Architect / Sys Admin from the time before DevOps was called DevOps. She's transitioned from managing thousands of servers on the front-lines\_to making executive level tool selection based on business needs and environment constraints."
