description: 'Want to be prepared for the next wave of technology? Want to know which framework, language or tool you should be learning now to be on the cutting edge tomorrow? Don''t worry about it. It doesn''t really matter. We are not monkeys, we adapt and learn. What does matter however is the Why, a question that has been forgotten while we''ve been answering theWhat and the How. In a world that is being driven by automation, information and interception, we are heading towards a society that not only Orwell might have predicted but also Huxley. Is this what we want?'
