title: '"We know when you are sleeping: The Rise of Energy Smart Meters" - Rachel Bunder (LCA 2020)'
recordingDate: 1579212927
description: "Rachel Bunder\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/100/\n\nAustralia is rolling out smart energy meters to all homes. Instead of an analogue meter that needs to be physically checked each billing cycle, a smart meter monitors your energy in 15 minute intervals and sends this data to your energy network providers.  Additionally, many people have smart home setups which often monitors your home energy usage in even more detail. Even many solar systems monitors your energy consumption. \r\n\r\nBut how much can you actually tell from this data? What could this be data used for? Who even has this data? In this talk I will show what energy data is actually being collected about you, who has access to it and what can be inferred from it. I will also discuss the wider implications of having a “smart” home and “smart” energy grid.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
