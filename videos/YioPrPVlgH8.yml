description: "Speaker(s):\nStephan Somogyi\n\nDescription:\nFor most developers, the security team at Google is a black box. Yet Safe Browsing and its API have been around for years and currently protect over a billion users. We also recently launched the source code to End-To-End, an encryption extension for Chrome, where we're explicitly calling for community feedback. And then there's the Google Transparency Report, which includes information both from Safe Browsing and from our Safer Email effort to understand how much encrypted email we send and receive. Please join us for a session about how Google's security team approaches its work, updates about End-To-End, Safe Browsing, and Safer Email, and how developers can tap into what we do.\n\nWatch all Google I/O 2014 videos at: g.co/io14videos"
