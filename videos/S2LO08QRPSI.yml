description: "PyData DC 2018\n\nGoing beyond “Sorry, I didn’t get that”: building AI assistants that scale using machine learning\n\nIn this workshop, you will get hands-on experience in developing intelligent AI assistants based entirely on machine learning and using only open source tools - Rasa NLU and Rasa Core. You will learn the fundamentals of conversational AI and the best practices of developing AI assistants that scale and learn from real conversational data.\n\nSlides - https://www.slideshare.net/JustinaPetraityt/going-beyond-sorry-i-didnt-get-that-building-ai-assistants-that-scale-using-machine-learning-123608017 \n===\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
