description: "John Hammink is the lead quality engineer for Firefox OS, and recently he stopped by the SFHTML5 User Group to give us a rare glimpse into the project.\n\nInterested in how Firefox is testing the OS formerly known as Boot 2 Gecko? Or Perhaps what the underlying architecture looks like? John covers both, and also addresses how to drive a community based QA effort for such a large open source project.\n\n** Head to http://marakana.com/s/tags/html5 for more!"
