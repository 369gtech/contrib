title: 'LING: not just Erlang on Xen - Porting LING to ARM/MIPS Microcontrollers'
language: English
recordingDate: 1434452987
description: "Slides: http://www.erlang-factory.com/euc2015/viktor-sovietov\n\nLING is an Erlang platform with minimal requirements with respect to its software environment. Until now LING has been limited to Xen-virtualised x86. We managed to port LING to ARM (Raspberry Pi). The port to PIC32 (MIPS) microcontrollers is in the works. The presentation discusses the challenges of running Erlang on bare metal and potential benefits of LING/Erlang as a basis for embedded development.\n\nTalk objectives:\n\n- Describes of how Erlang is applicable to develop IoT and embedded applications;\n\nTarget audience:\n\n- Erlang developers, technology entrepreneurs interested in IoT;"
