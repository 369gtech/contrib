title: 'How to speed up your application using JCache'
recordingDate: 1456224739
description: "(Recorded at Jfokus 2016. http://www.jfokus.com)\n\nHow to speed up your application using JCache\n\nIn this talk we will delve deep into JCache, the new caching standard for Java. There are six implementations of JCache, most of them open source. In this talk we will introduce you to the theory of caching, to such things as Pareto distributions and cache efficiency, N Times problem and so on. How to get the benefits out of it such as microsecond data access and offload of processing from expensive mainframe systems and databases. We also show you how to use this technology in a complementary way with NoSQL for performance speedup. We will show you how you can use JCache directly or with Spring. When and why to use distributed versus in-process caching and when to consider leaving caching and moving to In-Memory Data Grid techniques.\n\nGreg Luck, Hazelcast\n\nGreg was the co-spec lead on the recently completed JSR107 JCache specification and the was founder of Ehcache. He is a member of the JCP Executive Committee. Prior to Hazelcast, Greg was CTO at Terracotta."
