description: "Visit the largest developers congress in Europe: WeAreDevelopers World Congress, 16 - 18 May 2018 in Vienna, Austria.\n\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/congress/\n\nWhy do we even look down on our earth again? Isn’t deep space much more interesting? Yes, it is interesting, but investing time and effort on our own planet has its advantages as well. We still don’t know much about some parts of our own home and satellites provide us with an excellent opportunity to extract information about the weather, climate, other atmospheric and surface parameters - and the best part: they don’t require countless individuals to do the measuring. Win-Win? Obviously yes, but where are the problems? Data. Data. Data. And some more data. There are scientists all over the world doing their part in understanding how different parameters influence each other and lead to new insights and applications. But someone has to implement/realize this on all available data. So what exactly are the difficulties we’re facing and how can they be solved? Let me introduce you to high performance computing and all the challenges that come with it!\n\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/wearedevelopers.org/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/wearedevs/\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/wearedevelopers.org/"
