description: "Talk recording from Amsterdam JSNation 2018 Conference https://amsterdamjs.com\n\n# Mock to start\n\nWhen you are developing an application that uses remote REST API endpoints, it will be hard to implement a new feature that has not an API implementation yet. Also always you need to have a running API server to continue development. Then, you probably will have some troubles to test some very exceptional issues because it's hard to reproduce that kind of issues. All of these problems can be managed with a very simple client-side mocking approach. At this talk, we will talk about that approach and and how it is easy implementing a client-side mocking solution with connect-api-mocker library."
