description: "PyData Berlin 2018\n\nIn this talk I will try to explain the concept of few shot learning and will also give a brief glimpse where current research trends are in this field. Finally I will present some practical approaches on how to train a classifier with help of GANâ€™s and siamese networks given few labeled examples. \n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/VaibhavSingh2/visual-concept-learning\n---\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
