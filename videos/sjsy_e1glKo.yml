description: "Tickets are now available for The Lead Developer UK 2017: http://2017.theleaddeveloper.com/\n\nMany factors contribute to developer happiness. However, as engineers, we’re often singularly obsessed with the idea that our job satisfaction comes solely from solving only the most interesting technical challenges. In reality, research shows that we perform best when we are rested, feel valued, and feel connected to a cause so we can focus on high-priority work.\n\nThis talk will focus on ways engineering teams can foster excellent working environments and cultures with minimally felt process: much like sneaking vegetables into desserts.\n\nABOUT DURETTI HIRPA\n\nDuretti is a senior engineer on the backend engineering team at Slack. Currently, she’s working on the new user experience team, though she’s also spent time on the Slack Platform team, making it easier and more intuitive to build applications on top of Slack. She is constantly thinking of ways to humanise the engineering – there’s strength in the soft skills after all.\n\nDuretti is probably the most extroverted person she knows, and is intensely interested in other people. She produces a podcast called “snackoverflow”, about snacks, computers, and their surprising intersection. She has an undying love for Beyonce (praise be), an immaculate gif game, and a real candy problem."
