title: 'VS Code: Optimize Your NodeJS Development Inner Loop'
language: English
recordingDate: 1526929203
description: "Watch this video to learn something new about using VS Code and how to quickly build and deploy node.js applications and micro-services. We'll configure VS Code for the \"inner loop\" of development - the edit, compile, debug cycle. See how VS Code provides great code editing and code navigation experiences such as semantic IntelliSense, GoTo Definition, Find All References, Linting (e.g. ESLint), and more. We will configure VS Code to enable single file debugging, gulp file debugging, mocha debugging, and both client and server side debugging in a single session. You will see how easy it is to create Docker artifacts with VS Code, how to build and deploy images, and even how to debug your node.js applications running in containers. All of this from within a lightweight editor, in under 30 minutes!\n\nEVENT:\n\nNodeJS Interactive 2017\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nChris Dias\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nThe Linux Foundation provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOBK7hFqCTI"
