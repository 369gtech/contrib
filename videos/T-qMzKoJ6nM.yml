recordingDate: 1555345800
description: "Data pipelines are necessary for the flow of information from its source to its consumers, typically data scientists, analysts and software developers. Managing data flow from many sources is a complex task where the maintenance cost limits scale of being able to build a large reliable data warehouse. This presentation proposes a number of applied data engineering principles that can be used to build robust easily manageable data pipelines and data products. Examples will be shown using Python on AWS.\n\nEVENT:\n\nPyData London Meetup #54\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nGatis Seja\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nPyData provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video."
