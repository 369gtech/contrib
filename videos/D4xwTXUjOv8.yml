description: "Andrea Rosa\nPrincipal Software Engineer\nOracle\n\nIn the talk we will look at the fnproject which is the basis of the Oracle Fn serverless solutions. We will start implementing a simple 'hello world Style' application, deploy and execute it, from that point we will go deep trying to understand what actually happens during those different steps, during the journey we will explore the Oracle Fn architecture and components highlighting the benefit of a serverless solution from a developer point of view."
