description: "== Part 1: GraalVM for Java developers (Oleg Selajev)\nGraalVM is a high-performance virtual machine for dynamic, static, and native languages.\nGraalVM supports Java, Scala, Kotlin, Groovy, and other JVM-based languages. At the same time, it can run the dynamic scripting languages JavaScript including node.js, Ruby, R, and Python.\nIn this session we'll talk about the performance boost you can get from running your code on GraalVM, look at the examples of running typical web-applications with it, enhancing them with code in other languages, creating native images for incredibly fast startup and low memory overhead for your services.\n\nGraalVM offers you the opportunity to write the code in the language you want, and run the resulting program really fast.\n\n== Part 2: GraalVM for Sustainable Software Development? (Adrien Nortain)\nWith the crazy pace of digital transformations and hardware releases, introducing sustainability in our software solutions is becoming more and more of a challenge.\nUnfortunately, our planet has limited resources actually needed to build and run IT products.\nTherefore, if we want to continue adding value to the IT market, Green IT must not be considered a hobby or a trend anymore but a necessity.\nNow, when we talk about GraalVM, we usually focus on its Native Image feature.\nAnd while the technology itself is impressive, one must wonder: is it really helping writing sustainable software? What key aspects of a language / framework should we focus on in that regard?\nLet’s dive in and look at GraalVM from a different perspective!\n\n== Speakers\nOleg Šelajev is a developer advocate at Oracle Labs working on GraalVM -- the high-performance embeddable polyglot virtual machine. He organizes VirtualJUG, the online Java User Group, and a GDG chapter in Tartu, Estonia. In 2017 became a Java Champion.\n\nAdrien Nortain is a seasoned IT Consultant with experiences in many fields involving programming and designing enterprise-grade solutions,\nAdrien has advised on solutions architectures, led projects technically and mentored teams into adopting certain best practices related to Software Craftsmanship.\nHe is currently leading the technology-related topics at Zenika Singapore (career/learning paths, internal training, trends analysis...).\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/singajug/events/275681145/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\r\nRecorded by: Michael"
