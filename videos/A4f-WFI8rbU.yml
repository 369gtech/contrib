description: "Speaker: Steven Cooper (@developersteve)\n\nEver wanted to know the basics of how the PayPal and Braintree API’s and SDK’s work, and how they can be integrated into your code. In this session i will cover all of the PayPal and Braintree API’s and how they can be integrated. Come see how we can not only integrate but also deal with debugging.\n\nJust to be a little different (and possibly a world first) this will be done with the help of a creatively written fairy tale and with the help of actors, yes actors, who will play the part of the various stages of the API calls from retrieving the token from the PayPal server to the completion of the transaction.\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/WCgA/"
