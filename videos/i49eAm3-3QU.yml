description: 'Everyone needs a strategy: structured thinking and planning is essential for making choices about how to handle competition or how to serve our customers. Nevertheless strategies fail if people do not execute them, if they don’t get behind them. “Strategic frameworks used by big business look worn while compelling new theories are in short supply (Financial Times, 26 March 2015). Over the past decade companies have found rigid strategic frameworks hard to adapt to a fast-changing environment. And it is even more so within the companies where the IT sectors decide to “go agile”. Many things can and do go wrong, since no dev team stands alone. In this paper we will go through main traumas of a “big bang” agile implementation, its causes and its possible prevention and posttraumatic solutions. We will also propose a new model for strategic agility based on values, behavioral styles, orality and integration skills.'
