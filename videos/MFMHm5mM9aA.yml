description: "Ilya Grigorik (Google) presents how mobile networks are slow, unreliable, and have high variability both in latency and bandwidth - a nightmare to optimize for!  Right?  Well, almost.  Its not nearly as bad as it seems once you understand the limitations of the device and the radio network.
