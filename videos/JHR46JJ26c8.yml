recordingDate: 1480518997
description: "There has been a rapid increase in the frequency and volume of attacks on the Internet. In Q2, the record was 383 GB. In Q3, 1 TB was achieved. According to Akamai, more than 43% of network traffic was bot traffic in Q2.\n\nDyn was recently the subject of a major DDoS attack, its first significant disruption in over 15 years of operation. Phil Stanhope shares Dyn’s experience before exploring the rapid evolution of multilayer attacks happening on the Internet and outlining the steps to take to deal with them from an ops perspective.\n\nHow you operate in a crisis is critical to how you get through events like these, which unfortunately are becoming all too common. Whether you’re operating purely in the cloud, running your own bare metal and announcing BGP, or operating a hybrid model, there are lessons to be learned."
