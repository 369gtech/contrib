language: English
recordingDate: 1340920045
description: "Mike Procopio, Steve Bazyl\n\nWe'll go through how to implement complete Drive apps.  This is not an introduction to Drive apps, but rather how to build your product into Google Drive, and ensure that the experience is seamless for a user.  We will also discuss how to effectively distribute your app in the Chrome Web Store.  The example app built in this talk will demonstrate an example use case, but otherwise be production-ready.\n\nFor all I/O 2012 sessions, go to https://developers.google.com/io/"
