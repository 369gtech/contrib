description: "DevOpsDays Baltimore 2019 - Instilling DevOps Ways of Working in Large Enterprise - A Culture is Transformed by Chris Cyllis\n\nSo how can you tell if a culture is healthy or unhealthy? The collective attitudes and behaviors of individuals toward their workplace culture can shine a light on what’s working – and what’s not – in teams and organizations. While identifying and assessing attitudes and behaviors before, during, and after a transformation is no easy feat assessing leaders and teams before they enter their dojo, monitoring while in the dojo, and supporting after the dojo will create sustainable results. The culture will transform from the inside out.\n\nLet’s start with the basics. As it turns out, the biggest predictor of job satisfaction is how effectively organizations process information. Sociologist Ron Westrum developed a useful Three Cultures Model that shows the traits associated with three kinds of workplace cultures: Pathological (power oriented), Bureaucratic (rule-oriented), and Generative (performance oriented). A generative culture is the healthiest and highest performing. What exactly is a transformed (generative, performance-oriented) culture? We like to define it as the dynamic shared qualities that are transmitted from person to person and lived to their fullest in every way. In such a culture, new ideas are welcomed and people from across the organization act in the pursuit of common goals.\n\nWe started the culture transformation at this organization using both top-down and bottom-up cultural shifts:\n\nTop-Down\n\nWorking with leaders across the organization to help them see the possibility of a generative work environment\nTeach leaders in a 2-day targeted Dojo the basics of moving from power oriented toward performance oriented\nUsed a learning curriculum that includes collaboration, openness, and even some hands-on exercises to understand an automated software delivery (yes leaders actually coding and working with a pipeline)\nExposed challenges that teams have with top-down, power and fear-based management\nProvided alternative solutions to help leaders become more performance oriented leaders\nBottom-Up\n\nWork with team members by taking them out of their daily work, fostering within them on the new ways of working\nTeach teams in a 3-week immersion workshop the basics of moving from power oriented toward performance oriented\nUsed a learning curriculum that includes collaboration, openness, and included hands-on exercises to understand an automated software delivery\nBrought the same leaders from the 2-day experience to the Dojo to hear from teams the challenges that come with power and fear-based management\nProvided alternative solutions to help individuals and team members to become focused on delivering without barriers\nKey Take-Aways and Learning Outcomes:\n\nThe session will include a look into Leadership and Team curriculums and the formulas used to bridge the divide and move from Power to Performance. There will a focus on 4 tenants of culture in a transformed organization and how they are achieved through Leadership and Team Dojo experiences:\n\nCollaborative- Individuals feel safe enough to share information and opinions, as well as to ask questions freely without being shut down or punished.\n\nAccountable- IT products and services are created and delivered by a self-organizing team that co-owns solutions from ideation to production.\n\nAutonomous - Teams and team members are empowered to make real-time decisions related to product design, development, and delivery.\n\nResilient - Quick individual and team response to identify, correct, and improve team behaviors or working conditions before they compound and become larger problems."
