description: "Lars Schneider & Taylor Blau, of AutoDesk and GitHub respectively, discuss recent performance improvements to Git LFS. \n\nGit and its extensions are becoming more popular than ever. However, certain use cases may still be suboptimal. We identified a way to dramatically improve performance in a popular Git extension - LFS (Large File Storage) - that required changes in both Git Core, and the extension itself. Based on our combined experiences weâ€™ll walk you through the process of a successful contribution to each project with the help of mailing lists and Pull Requests. If you have already a bit of Git command line knowledge then this talk will prepare you for your first contribution to Git, an extension, or both.\n\nAbout GitMerge\nGit Merge is the pre-eminent Git-focused conference: a full-day offering technical content and user case studies, plus a day of workshops for Git users of all levels. Git Merge is dedicated to amplifying new voices in the Git community and to showcasing the most thought-provoking projects from contributors, maintainers and community managers around the world.
