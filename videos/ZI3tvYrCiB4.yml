title: 'Impromptu Orchestra: HTTP/2 and Reactive Streams by Berwout de Vries Robles'
language: English
recordingDate: 1557993506
description: "There have been some large developments in web technology. With the introduction of HTTP/2.0 in 2015, Server Sent Events have received a new life as Reactive Streams. To explore these technologies with you, I have made an application that turns the audience into an orchestra using Reactive Streams to connect to the audiencesâ€™ cellphones. In the talk we will look at how and why HTTP/2.0 came to be. I will show you what you need to do to make practical use of HTTP/2.0. I will give you some practical guidelines for how to choose between Reactive Streams and similar technologies. We will briefly go over the core concepts behind Reactive Streams and I will show you how easy it is to get started using libraries such as Spring Reactor. Lastly we will see just how \"Reactive\" Reactive Streams truly are. Your cellphones will become orchestra members playing a musical composition and receiving their instructions in real-time with Reactive Streams!\n\nMy talk will have been a success when at the end of my talk: You understand why we have HTTP/2.0, what the main features are and how we can use them in practice. You understand what Reactive Streams are, when to use them and how they work."
