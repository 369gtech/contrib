description: "In this talk, Brian and Filip will skip all the theory about reactive extensions (Rx) and dive right into practical use. How can Rx help you with autocomplete? What about when you have several fallback scenarios? What if the state of your app depends on three separate data sources, all asynchronous and live? We’ll be live-coding with Flutter and its handy StreamBuilder widget — but these little patterns are applicable everywhere else.\n\nEVENT:\n\nReactiveConf 2018\n\nSPEAKERS:\n\nBrian Egan & Filip Hracek\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nReactiveConf Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video."
