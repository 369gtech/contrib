title: 'What’s Past is Prologue: A Story of Event-Driven Architecture- Tim Berglund'
recordingDate: 1636404029
description: "The growth of Kafka inside an organization sometimes follows the development of the broader Kafka ecosystem over its lifetime. The initial use case may be something conceptually simple, like mainframe offload or point-to-point integration, evoking the simple Large Pipe architectures of Kafka’s infancy.\nThis talk traces this development, ending with a comprehensive vision of an event-driven architecture suitable for the next generation of information technology deployments. You’ll leave knowing where you need to go and how this new architectural paradigm will help you get there.\n\n//bio\nTim is a teacher, author, and technology leader with Confluent, where he serves as the Senior Director of Developer Relations.
