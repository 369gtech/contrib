description: 'Digital revolution is enabling large enterprises to move towards bimodal IT, self-service operating model, decentralised business and IT lines of businesses while maintaining a certain degree of centralised governance and control. Key enablers such as Enterprise Agile Adoption, Continuous Delivery, Cloud First, Mobile First Strategies are undoubtedly helping organisations to be more innovative, achieve faster time to market and drive customer centric strategies. However, without a short, medium and long-term business and technology capability requirement and corresponding organisational models and technology platform requirements, digital transformation is incomplete. One should evolve strategically toward self-service by evolving business capabilities, technology roadmap, roles and delivery models that would actually support these needs.'
