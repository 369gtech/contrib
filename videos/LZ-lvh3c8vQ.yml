description: "These days, you can’t swing a dry erase marker without hitting someone talking about microservices. Developers are studying Eric Evan’s prescient book, Domain-Driven Design. Teams are refactoring monolithic apps, looking for bounded contexts, and defining a ubiquitous language. And although there have been countless articles, videos, and talks to help you convert to microservices, few have spent any appreciable time asking if a given application should be a microservice.\n\nIn this talk, I'll show you a set of factors you can apply to help you decide if something deserves to be a microservice or not. We’ll also look at what we need to do to maintain a healthy micro(services)biome.\n\nLearn more: https://pv.tl/2BxyWl5\n\nSpeaker: Nate Schutta, Developer Advocate, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2019\nSlideShare: coming soon"
