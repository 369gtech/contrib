description: "While startups can be great for venture capitalists, they're usually a poor deal for the participants. After working crazy hours for months or years, you face depressingly low odds of success. But there's another way: By finding a niche and deliberately staying small, you can dramatically up the chance of success - while balancing income, hours and lifestyle. Without having to answer to investors or an employer.\n\nThe rules for a software lifestyle business are very different to the rules for a start-up. In this session, I'll share what I've learned over the past 10 years, writing and selling a successful programming utility. We'll cover both technical and business topics, including idea incubation, marketing, competitive analysis and monetization, as well as practical tips on payment processing, dealing with large corporations and resellers, providing support, and maximizing productivity and happiness while sole-programming."
