description: "Ben Short\nhttp://linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/178/\nThere is a lot of radio spectrum out there, and while some of it is available for use to the public, much of of the spectrum is licensed out to private business, defence and government uses, and is also limited in how you can use what is available. Fortunately you can can access to a significant amount of this RF spectrum by becoming an amateur radio operator!\r\nThis session will give a brief introduction to the types of Licenses available and the costs with getting a license before taking a look at what you need to know in order to obtain a license with several sample questions, and finishing up with some Q&A at the end.\r\nIf you've had an interest in radio, but always wondered what the next step may be, then this session is for you!"
