description: "PyData Berlin 2018\n\nThere are lots of reasons using a cloud service is favorable, but how to make sure consistency between development and deployment? With Docker, we can \"ship\" the project to different platforms in the same environment. Going one step further we can also create the cloud infrastructure as code with Terraform. As an example, we will deploy a Jupyter notebook on Google Cloud Platform using both tools.\n---\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
