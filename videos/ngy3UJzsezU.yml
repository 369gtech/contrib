description: "DevConf - The Software Craftsmen Festival for Sharing Knowledge and Inspiration (https://devconf.pl/)\n\n“Microservices” is certainly a buzzword. Everybody wants to work on microservices applications. However when working on such a project you’ll soon realize that a buzzword doesn’t magically make your application work. And there will be a lot of challenges that you’ll face on this journey. During this session I will share my experience from the trenches of a microservices project aiming to make developers aware of the different challenges they mostly won’t see at conferences. I will also try to illustrate my experiences with relevant code samples."
