description: "This is the first Ask Me Anything kicking off the IT Revolution Book Club featuring Team Topologies. We're joined by co-author Manuel Pais.\n\nBelow are the questions with timestamp links to the answers.\n\n1. Question: How much value you might've seen created at other small companies where they made one or two people the enabling team?\nAnswer: https://youtu.be/8em9l2mdni8?t=199\n\n2. Question: Everywhere I've been we've grappled with the question of how to form teams for maximum effect, and struggled to find the right patterns.  At my current client, we've begun to create dedicated cross-functional teams who own value streams as we've defined them.  Our definition of a value stream is a part of the system that aligns with a part of the customer journey, e.g., web engagement, cart & checkout, and then feature sets in the app (think Spotify, because we deliver entertainment content).  Our app lives on approx 6 platforms, e.g., Android, Chrome, iOS, etc.  We're early on, so we're struggling to define the boundary between client-specific app teams, stream-aligned teams, and enabling teams.  I'm sure I'll find helpful examples as I get further into the book, but I'd like to know if there are heuristics we can apply at this stage of our team creation?\nAnswer: https://youtu.be/8em9l2mdni8?t=489\n\n3. Question: Did you look at any other high-performing organizations and their teaming models to help shape the topologies that evolved into what we see in the book?\nAnswer: https://youtu.be/8em9l2mdni8?t=997\n\n4. What is your general opinion on rotating resources that temporarily join a team (e.g. DevOps-Team1) to build up know how and moving to the next team (e.g. DevOps-Team2) after a fundamental structure have been built? What would be the impact on creating maybe even new unwanted communication patterns in an organization then?\nAnswer: https://youtu.be/8em9l2mdni8?t=1200\n\n5. Question: Where does management fit in Team Topologies? Also, what are some of the challenges managers transitioning to the various patterns in TT have had and how have they addressed them?\nAnswer: https://youtu.be/8em9l2mdni8?t=1632\n\n6. Question: With regards to platform teams, what do you think of Jeff Bezos’s famous Amazon edict that every single team should have some amount of external customer facing responsibility?  Or, in other words, are there are any dangers lurking with platform teams who only have internal “customers”?\nAnswer: https://youtu.be/8em9l2mdni8?t=2019\n\n7. Question: Management is about to define who decides about what and who is responsible for what. Maybe you have some advice on that? What would be a big no-no and should be avoided? How should the business units be formed to best support value creating teams? Are there any books about this?\nAnswer: https://youtu.be/8em9l2mdni8?t=2325\n\n8. Question: What is the worst team topology you have heard of? What happened there?\nAnswer: https://youtu.be/8em9l2mdni8?t=2736\n\n9. Question: When the team is a delivery bottleneck, how can we identify if it is a cognitive load problem or it's a result of bad estimation/planning practices?\nAnswer: https://youtu.be/8em9l2mdni8?t=3193\n\n10. Question: We don't want to overload the team cognitive load, that's fine. But Agile and DevOps suggests that team should have all the skills to do their work. We want people to not only have 1 expertise, but to expand their knowledge and become T-shape people. How to we balance that with cognitive overloads?\nAnswer: https://youtu.be/8em9l2mdni8?t=3249\n\n11. Question: Is there a core definition of ‘team’ that you use?\nAnswer: https://youtu.be/8em9l2mdni8?t=3377\n\n12. Question: What was the most surprising thing you learned while writing this book?  (eels and groupers don't count!) What belief(s) or opinion(s) did you have changed as a result of researching and writing the book?\nAnswer: https://youtu.be/8em9l2mdni8?t=3591\n\n13. Question: Along this line - what were the key thoughts which crystallized in the process of writing the book?\nAnswer: https://youtu.be/8em9l2mdni8?t=3685\n\nTeam Topologies is available here: https://itrevolution.com/team-topologies/"
