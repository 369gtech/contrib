description: "Learn how to Leverage Kubernetes to Support 12 Factor for Enterprise Apps - Brad Topol & Michael Elder, IBM \n\n“12 Factor” is a software methodology for building scalable microservice applications that provides best practices designed to enable applications to be built with portability, resilience, and scalability when deployed to the web. In this talk we provide an overview of the 12 Factor methodology and describe how the core constructs provided by Kubernetes can be leveraged to support the 12 factors for scalable web apps. In this talk we will provide live demonstrations of how Kubernetes can support 12 Factor for not only newer cloud native applications, but also for legacy enterprise middleware applications that include stateful and transactional workloads. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPXZ"
