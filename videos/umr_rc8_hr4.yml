description: "by Björn Schießle\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/UD2.218A/nextcloud.webm\n\n\nNextcloud enables you to regain control over your data and freely share and sync them. That's probably the part of Nextcloud most people are already familiar with. But Nextcloud takes huge efforts to go beyond handling your data and provides strong collaboration and communication tools. In 2019 most people not only want to store their data, they are looking for a integrated platform which allows them to do actual work with their data. In this context collaborative editing but also video, audio and text chat, integration with your contacts and calendars and many more play an important role. If you want to do this without losing the connection to your friends, family and co-workers strong federation capabilities are needed. Federation is at the heart of Nextcloud and was completely re-written last year based on the vendor neutral Open Cloud Mesh (OCM) specification. \n\nAdditionally to the OCM implementation which allows you to share data across Nextcloud instances, we are excited to announce that with Nextcloud 15 we joined the Fediverse with our own ActivityPub implementation. This turns every Nextcloud user into a participant of the free, open and federated social network and allow them to communicate with people on Mastodon, Friendica, Pleroma and many more. Join the talk and learn what you can do with Nextcloud and how to join the cloud federation. \n\nRoom: UD2.218A\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 15:30:00+01"
