description: "Richard Rabbat,  Joshua Marantz,  Hï¿½kon Wium Lie\r\n\r\nmod_pagespeed is an Apache module that web developers can use to automate web page performance optimizations. In this talk, we examine how mod_pagespeed improves web page speed and reduces network bandwidth usage and describe the measured benefits on these pages. We then describe WebP, a new image format for the web, that reduces the bandwidth needs for images by 40% over JPEG for a comparable quality and demonstrate its support in Chrome and Opera."
