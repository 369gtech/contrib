description: "Benefits of a Service Mesh When Integrating Kubernetes with Legacy Services - Stephan Fudeus & David Meder-Marouelli, 1&1 Mail & Media Development & Technology GmbH \n\nHaving Kubernetes for your service landscape is great. Having a service mesh technology inside is even better - but there are legacy services, too. Leveraging the benefits of a service mesh is possible even without migrating all your legacy services into your kubernetes cluster - you can integrate them into the mesh.    We'll give a brief overview of the properties and benefits of service meshes in general and specifically how they are configurable in Istio. Then we'll have a look at the expansion of the mesh to services outside of kubernetes. We'll go into how the expansion is done, what needs to be done in the legacy systems and what obstacles we had to overcome.   On a sidetrack we'll show a \"service mesh light\", a mechanism to make legacy services protected by IP ACLs accessible from your kubernetes cluster, without deploying a full fledged service mesh implementation. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPep"
