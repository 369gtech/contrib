description: "When I got my first job as a software developer, I didn't realise I could actively craft a tech career that fit my life.\nIn this talk, I share everything I wish I had known a decade ago: how to deal with impostor syndrome, why communication skills are equally as important as technical skills, understanding your values, creating your own measuring stick of awesome so you're living up to yourself and not to the benchmarks of a corporate performance review, how to land a tech job in another country or freelance remotely, and why it's okay not to have a programming side project."
