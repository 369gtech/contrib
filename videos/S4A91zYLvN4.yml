description: "Do you ever feel demotivated in your daily job? Do you feel your voice is not being heard much or at all? Everyone passes through stressful times with insurmountable challenges, but sometimes taking a step back analyzing what we have done and achieved so far allow us to see the situation from a different perspective. In this talk, I walk through some of my failures and successes sharing my learnings in more than 15 years in the industry and providing suggestions on how you could have an impact as an IT professional.\n\nLuca Mezzalira, VP of Architecture - DAZN\n\nIâ€™m the VP of Architecture at DAZN with more than 15 years of experience, a Google Developer Expert on Web Technologies and the London Javascript community Manager. I had the chance to work on cutting-edge projects for mobile, desktop, web, TVs, set top boxes and embedded devices. I am currently designing DAZN with my team, a sports video platform based on the cloud with millions of users that are watching live and on-demand contents. I'm the author of Front-End Reactive Architectures published by APress: https://goo.gl/ywAmsx"
