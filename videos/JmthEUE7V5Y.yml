description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nSupporting Confidential Workloads with SPIRE - Andrey Brito & Matteus Silva, UFCG\n\nThe SPIRE community has already perceived the potential benefits of using confidential computing. Confidential computing can protect sensitive workloads by enforcing stronger attestation but also securing SPIRE components themselves, which in turn helps to make other attestation mechanisms more secure. Nevertheless, providing this support is far from trivial. As it changes SPIRE’s current threat model, there are several challenges to be addressed and tradeoffs to be made clear. In this talk, we share our experience in providing confidential computing support in SPIRE, from the challenges in deriving selectors to the benefits of running other SPIRE components within trusted execution environments, all this while minimizing changes in SPIRE operation and application development workflows."
