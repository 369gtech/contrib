description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nIngress on the Rails: Use Community Tools to Automate Ingress Provisioning - Alastair Firth, Camunda \n\nRouting traffic into your clusters is a key part of many Kubernetes workloads. The tools to manage this are great, but getting them all to work together can be a configuration nightmare for the uninitiated. Alastair Firth will demonstrate a concrete, automated, cloud-provider agnostic setup for provisioning DNS, TLS certs, and monitoring using community tools like ExternalDNS, cert-manager, Prometheus, Grafana, and Helm with the kubernetes/ingress-nginx controller so you can securely serve and monitor HTTPS and HTTP/2 (e.g. GRPC) traffic to many hostnames across multiple Kubernetes clusters.\n\nhttps://sched.co/ZeqC"
