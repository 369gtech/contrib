title: 'Kotlin Deep Dive by Guy Heylens and David Gonza?lez'
language: English
recordingDate: 1510048602
description: "Let’s take you on a journey of Kotlin, the language created by Jetbrains for the JVM. Since the announcement that Google made in May we have seen an increase in interest in this language. In this talk we will try to cover as much as possible about the language in a deep dive. In the first part we will create a Rest API with Kotlin and show you the possibilities in using Kotlin as a server side language. In part 2 we will consume the Rest API with an Android app. In both parts we will use different features, so you get a good understanding of Kotlin.\n\n# Guy Heylens\nI am a free lance software developer, I have been creating Android apps in Java for about 5 years untill I discovered Kotlin. Now I only use Kotlin for Android apps. I am also looking into other possibilities for the Kotlin language like Spring IO, native kotlin. I am also the founder of the Belgian Kotlin User Group.\n\n# David González\nDavid is an Android Software Engineer at Help Scout and a Google Developer Expert for Android (https://goo.gl/hWnJl6) who has been developing with the Android platform since 2009. He's actively involved in the Android community, previously in Berlin and London, and now co-organizing the Kotlin User Group in Belgium and the GDG Brussels.\n\nHe enjoys public speaking and loves sharing his experiences through conferences, blog posts and open source libraries like the Android Architecture Blueprints (https://goo.gl/d9l7IN). He is also a Google Startup Launchpad mentor, helping startups and companies produce highly desirable and quality products, by following agile methodologies; a skilled development process; and always going the extra mile."
