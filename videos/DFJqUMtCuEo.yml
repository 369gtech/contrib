description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nBuilding, Managing and Automating Clusters at Scale With Prow - Michael Splain, Sonos, Inc. \n\nWhether building your first or 100th Kubernetes cluster, it eventually becomes clear- this must be automated. These days, building and customizing a cluster is pretty straight forward based on your required workloads, infrastructure and tooling. The real hard work comes when answering the question, how do we manage this long term? In this talk you’ll learn how we accelerated our automation by moving our cluster management to the CI system built and trusted by Kubernetes itself, Prow. We will start at the basics of Prow and work up to why it was a great fit for us. Finally we’ll show how it all works and discuss how to approach your own cluster automation at scale. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ekDL"
