description: "Google Tech Talks\nJanuary, 10 2008\n\nIn this talk, we will explore the use of on-line non-parametric time series\nanalysis and prediction to build virtualized services in distributed\ncomputing environments. In particular, by analyzing and predicting the\nfuture behavior of one set of distributed services we explore how they can be\namalgamated dynamically to implement a \"virtual\" service overlay with\nproperties that are not supported by any of the constituent service\ncomponents (i.e. derive strictly from aggregation).\n\nWe illustrate the approach by detailing distributed batch-scheduling mechanisms\nthat provide both reservation and co-allocation services in environments that\nexplicitly do not support them. While our work focuses on national-scale\nscientific computing infrastructure, we believe its alternative approach to\nvirtualizing distributed systems abstractions is important in a larger\nscalable systems context for two reasons. First, because the methodology is\ninherently statistical, it improves with scale making scale a tool (rather\nthan an impediment) in terms of implementation. Secondly, it shares many\ncommon features, both conceptually and implementationally with scalable search\nservices making it possible, we believe, to explore the use of\ncommercial search infrastructure in future work.\n\nSpeaker: Rich Wolski\nMy origins, like those of most people born in North America during this century, are ambiguous and questionable. I am currently an Associate Professor in the Computer Science Department at the University of California, Santa Barbara which is, of course, located in Goleta California for all intents and purposes that do not involve the U.S. Mail. My past is checkered (it used to be plaid, but I've been politely informed that a past can only be so retro). Formerly, I enjoyed the hospitable climes offered by the Computer Science Department at the  University of Tennessee. I've also done time as research faculty member in the  U.C. San Diego CS&E Department where I researched CS and a little E (every now and then) in a decidedly pedagogical manner. My research interests include, but are not limited to, Computational Grid computing for performance, parallel and distributed systems, and the endless metaphysical search for the perfect coffee cup."
