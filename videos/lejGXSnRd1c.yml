Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io\_The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nNo More Event-Loss：Managing Workloads Over Unstable Network With KubeEdge - Fei Xu, Huawei \n\nIt's well known that Kubernetes has become the de facto standard for orchestrating containerized workloads running in the data center, and relies on stable wired network.    But in scenarios such as smart campus management，we will run the master in the data center, and the edge nodes in various decentralized areas. In this case, there is no stable network connection between K8s master and nodes, and nodes may even be offline for a long time. This indeed caused troubles: the control events from the master to the edge nodes may be lost, which results in uncertainty of application management at edge.    In this session,we will share how KubeEdge implemented reliable event transmission over unstable network. It ensures control events sent to the edge even if node is restarted or has been offline for a period of time, in order to achieve status consistency for applications at edge timely. \n\nhttps://sched.co/cp90"
