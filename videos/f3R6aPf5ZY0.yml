title: 'Christian Horsdal - Collaboration in Socio-Techinical Systems'
language: English
recordingDate: 1620120928
description: "Microservice architectures and organizational structures are isomorphic. Both require large amounts of collaboration to work. One is technical and collaborates in terms of events, commands, queries, protocols, data contracts, and so on.\n\nThe other isn't technical and collaboration is in terms of groups, teams, meetings, documents, chats, relationships, and much more. In both collaboration is complex.\n\nIn this talk, I explore how the collaboration on the one side mirrors the collaboration on the other. How we can organize our services to make the organizations work better. And how we can organize to make the services work better."
