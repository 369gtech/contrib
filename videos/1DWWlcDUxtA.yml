description: "Kubectl Apply 2019: Defense Against the Dark Arts - Phillip Wittrock & Jennifer Buckley, Google \n\nKubectl Apply (loved and hated by users) is the canonical way to manage Kubernetes Resources, and the building block for systems performing continuous delivery. Originally written in 2015, the inner workings of Apply have been referred to as the “dark arts” and have been accused of “making peoples eyeballs bleed”. The Apply maintainers took this feedback, and embarked on a journey to completely rearchitect Apply, this time without unleashing a primordial evil. In 2019 Apply received its first major architectural overhaul, addressing long standing issues and bringing a cornucopia of new functionality to users and platform developers. Phillip Wittrock and Jenny Buckley will review both the changes in architecture and the new functionality that will usher in a delivery renaissance for Kubernetes. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPZ1"
