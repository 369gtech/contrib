description: "In this talk, we will discuss Machine Learning practices in Software Testing stages in detail with a case study. This is an important study since nowadays, researches are looking for adaptation of Machine Learning algorithms to testing processes to reduce the manual effort and improve quality.\n\nWe start with a quick view of the machine learning types. Then, we list AI applications in testing these perspectives: test definition, implementation, execution, maintenance and grouping, and bug handling. Whatâ€™s more, we do not only present existing AI applications but also what can be done in the future. Finally, we summarize the application areas with algorithms and discuss the advantages and potential risks of AI applications in software testing."
