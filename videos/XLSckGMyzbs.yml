description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2018\n—\nRebuilding legacy apps with open source libraries and tools is the most fun I have had yet. For over a year, I have been updating legacy 4GL/Windows applications to Linux and C++. A primary hang-up of the old system is its lack of scalability. In order to design the replacements with more breadth we implemented 0MQ (zeromq.org) for our communications protocol. When the messages you send are in XML you can easily save another 30% in message size just by switching to JSON (nlohmann/json). The JSON works well with 0MQ as its primary message input is char*. Here using scaled down version of our production code, we will demonstrate how we use it and what we learned so far.\nHere is the repository for source and slides:https://github.com/kevinbcarpenter/jz18sub/\nThanks to all who attended!\n— \nKevin Carpenter, EPX / NABANCARD\nProject Engineer, Lead\n\nPreviously I developed on Windows with MFC building applications that perform financial simulations. Now I get to see how fast I can make credit card transactions complete using Linux and Oracle. For hobbies I enjoy working with micro-controllers interfaced to the real world. Both small robotics and automotive applications.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
