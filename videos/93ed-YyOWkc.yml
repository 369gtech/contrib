description: "Michał Gałka\n\nWe all somehow get the feeling that MicroPython is not quite the Python we know. During the talk, I’ll show what the “not quite” actually means. I'll present a set of different issues I stumbled upon when working with different MicroPython powered boards ranging from memory constraints to API calls.\n\nhttps://2019.pycon-au.org/talks/micropython-gotchas\n\nPyCon AU, the national Python Language conference, is on again this August in Sydney, at the International Convention Centre, Sydney, August 2 - 6 2019.\n\nVideo licence: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 - https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU\n\nSun Aug  4 14:50:00 2019 at C3.4 & C3.5"
