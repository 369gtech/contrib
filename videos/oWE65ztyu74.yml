description: "SoundCloud is the biggest repository of audio content on the web, with more than 25 million users, from the BBC and Al Jazeera to Skrillex and Radiohead. In this fast paced environment, time to market and innovation are crucial, and the software architecture must follow suit.\nOver the past months we evolved from a single gigantic Ruby on Rails application to a network of loosely coupled services built in Go, Scala, Clojure and Erlang; and from a traditional server-rendered website to a single-page application, completely rendered in JavaScript on the browser and using our peopular public API.\nIn this talk, let's explore the core principles which help SoundCloud's architecture to evolve in a neck-breaking speed and still\nmaintain design philosophy and good practices."
