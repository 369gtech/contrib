description: "RubyConf 2018 - High-speed cables for Ruby by Vladimir Dementyev\n\nModern web applications actively use real-time features. Unfortunately, nowadays Ruby is rarely considered as a technology to implement yet another chat â€“ Ruby performance leaves much to be desired when dealing with concurrency and high-loads.\n\nDoes this mean that we should betray our favorite language, which brings us happiness, in favor of others?\n\nMy answer is NO, and I want to show you, how we can combine the elegance of Ruby with the power of other languages to improve the performance of real-time applications."
