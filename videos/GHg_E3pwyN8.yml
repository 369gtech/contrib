title: 'AI and the future of computing, are we all cyborgs now? by Amber Case'
recordingDate: 1519313108
description: "Calm technology describes a state of technological maturity where a user’s primary task is not computing, but being human. The idea behind Calm Technology is to have smarter people, not things. Technology shouldn’t require all of our attention, just some of it, and only when necessary. How can our devices take advantage of location, proximity and haptics to help improve our lives instead of getting in the way? How can designers can make apps “ambient” while respecting privacy and security? This talk will cover how to use principles of Calm Technology to design the next generation of connected devices. We’ll look at notification styles, compressing information into other senses, and designing for the least amount of cognitive overhead. We’ll also look at the rise of Artificial Intelligence.\n\nAmber Case, Case Organic\nAmber Case is a cyborg anthropologist and user experience designer from Portland, Oregon.
