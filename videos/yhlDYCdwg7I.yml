description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nFrom Storming to Performing: Growing Your Project's Contributor Experience - Matt Butcher & Karen Chu, Microsoft\n\nThe early days of a project seem so clear. Write some code, author some documentation, & post it on GitHub. Then wait for those GitHub stars! But OSS is as much about people as code. We’ll take an honest look at the contributor experience for a sustainable open source project. We apply the form/storm/norm/perform model as a way to approach growth. With stories, examples, & our own experiences, we share practical guidance on how you can set your open source contributor community on a course to not just survive, but thrive. Part 1: Form — Tackling first tasks together *Code *Website *Messaging *Docs Part 2: Storm — Gaining trust & sorting things out *Resolving disputes *Code of Conduct *Governance *Coding standards *Contributors are not employees/coworkers Part 3: Norm — Sharing responsibility *Issue management *Delegating work *Standardizing communication channels Part 4: Perform — Optimizing for the long haul *Retaining maintainers *Maintainer turnover & recruiting *Emeritus status"
