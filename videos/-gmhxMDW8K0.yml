description: "THE CODE WE WRITE HAS NO VALUE!\n\nCan that really be true?\n\nRecently, within Capgemini, we tried to understand why the development community is so big on sharing knowledge, compared with other communities. The kudos you get from sharing code has a greater value to your career than the code itself. With sites like Stack Exchange, you can download every snippet of code you’ll ever need. Add this to the Open Source movement, and the growing number of products which generate code from diagrams and GUIs, and the scary conclusion drawn was exactly that: writing code has become an indulgence and not a necessity.\n\nSo, what IS of value in what we do?\n\nThrough a study of PaaS “citizen integrator” projects that didn’t require any code to be written at all, I’ll try and distil the skills that underly our job description as developers."
