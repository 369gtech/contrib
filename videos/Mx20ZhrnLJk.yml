description: "James Won, LinkedIn\n\nCaching is integral to any large-scale web operation. LinkedIn formed a dedicated caching team in 2017 and since then we have built out automation and infrastructure to support over 7 million queries/second across more than one-hundred clusters.\n\nIn this talk, I will be speaking through:\n\nWhy this team needed to exist\nWhat we wanted to improve (e.g. tighter integration with existing deployment infrastructure)\nHow we integrated a third-party product into our deployment system\nThings we wish we did differently after implementing our initial automation/tooling\nImplementing seamless upgrades (compare it to how things were in the past)\nTransitioning from running in root to non-root\nTooling we created to provision stores quickly\nWhere we want to take caching at LinkedIn\nThings to consider about if your team provides a datastore as a service\n\nView the full SREcon19 Asia/Pacific program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon19asia/program\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
