description: "Java PaaS platforms have grown like mushrooms and now speak multiple languages (they are called polyglot). Now companies such as Oracle and IBM also offer their avatars of Java PaaS. Many Java developers are still confused about which one to use and whether Java PaaS makes sense for their applications. This session compares the leading Java PaaS platforms—such as Amazon’s AWS Elastic Beanstalk, CloudBees, and Cloud Foundry, in addition to Oracle’s and IBM’s platforms—and identifies the merits and demerits of each. The session also discusses challenges of using Java PaaS and provides best practices for building applications that do not undermine Java’s promise of  build once, deploy anywhere. \n\n\nAuthor:\nDebu Panda\nDebu Panda is technologist based in the San Francisco bay area.
