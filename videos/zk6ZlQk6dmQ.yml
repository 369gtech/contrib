description: "If you're like me, you use way too much power & youâ€™re not quite sure where. Tracking your power usage is a great start, but analyzing the data is often easiest when it's in a database. Typing it in by hand would be a pain; let's void a warranty instead! This will be a high level walk-through of building & modifying the learn.adafruit.com/tweet-a-watt project. You'll leave this session with the tools to track the data in your own projects & hopefully some new ideas. (But no electrical burns!)\n\nI started programming in 1995. For most of my career, I have used Oracle tools to build applications. I have worked with Oracle Forms and Oracle Reports and even created a framework to generate web applications using PL/SQL similar to Oracle Application Express. I have done a little Java, both inside and outside the database, and of course a whole bunch of SQL and PL/SQL. Several years ago, I got hooked on open source and went exploring. I wrote a tiny bit of Perl, explored using Solr and Elastic Search as a database for small projects, wrote even more Java, built a project with Ruby for a small Autism center, and most lately got all excited about JavaScript. My combined experience with Oracle Database and open source led me to a brand-new position at Oracle: Oracle Developer Advocate for Open Source. I help our users figure out how to take full advantage of Oracle Database technologies from open source tools. I promote the use of open source inside and outside of Oracle.\n\nhttps://developer.oracle.com/\nhttps://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/tryit"
