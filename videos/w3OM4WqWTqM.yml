description: "About 3 years ago we at Bryntum started a complete rewrite of our suite of advanced JavaScript components. One main focus area for the new versions was performance. Along the way we learned a lot about that topic, some of the knowledge will be shared here. Being a quick talk, live demos will be done on a select few areas:\n\nGarabage collection blunders\n\nDOM costs\n\nCSS to speed up layout and paint times\n\nJohan Isaksson\nBryntum\n\nRecorded at Jfokus 2020 in Stockholm 4th of february\nhttp://www.jfokus.se"
