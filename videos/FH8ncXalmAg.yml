title: 'To JAR Hell And Back - A Live Migration to the Java 9 Module System by Nicolai Parlog'
recordingDate: 1519313108
description: "I'm sure you've heard about compatibility issues with upgrading to Java 9 and the new module system but did you try it yourself yet? This live coding session starts with a typical Java application and runs up against and eventually overcomes the common hurdles: * build system configuration * dependency analysis with `jdeps` * dependencies on internal APIs and Java EE modules * split packages * stepwise modularization with automatic modules To get the most out of this talk, you should have a good understanding of the module system basics - afterwards you will know how to approach *your* application's migration to Java 9 and the module system.\n\nNicolai Parlog, CodeFX\nNicolai is a thirty year old boy, as the narrator would put it, who has found his passion in software development. He constantly reads, thinks, and writes about it, and codes for a living as well as for fun. Nicolai writes a book about the Java 9 module system[1], blogs about software development on codefx.org[2], recently started a YouTube channel[3], and is a long-tail contributor to several open source projects. You can hire him[4] for all kinds of things.
