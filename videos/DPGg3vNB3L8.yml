description: "SaaSB - One Broker to Rule Them All - Christian Brinker, evoila\n\n At the foot of mount coal there was forged a service broker. One Broker to rule them all. For the hackathon at the CF Summit Europe 2017 the fellowship of the broker came together to bring Cloud Foundry a service broker to enable access to the marketplace for all of the apps deployed to Cloud Foundry.\n\nCloud Foundry helps developers to deploy their applications in a fast and easy manner. Thereby one of the key benefits is usage of services from the marketplace. But one problem remains. The high isolation between platform users leads to a lack of interaction points between them. Either sharing solutions between departments in private clouds or monetizing your applications in public clouds is well support.\n\nBut why not providing your apps through the marketplace to other platform users? This addresses the winning team of the CF Summit Europe 2017 hackathon with their Software-as-a-Service-Broker. A service broker allowing the platform provider to enable offerings of apps in the marketplace. Normally this needs the development of a new service broker for each kind of app. The SaaSB even enables for a pay-as-you-go selling of the apps via the platform provider.\n\n“One Broker to rule them all,\nOne Broker to find them;\nOne Broker to bring them to all\nand in Cloud Foundry bind them.” \n\nAbout Christian Brinker\nAs long-standing member of the evoila Automation and Technology team and Automation Engineer Christian Brinker is well experienced in the automation of cloud environments.
