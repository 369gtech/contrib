title: 'YOW! West 2016 Giovanni Lodi - Super Testable Code using Functional Reactive Programming'
recordingDate: 1470815465
description: "Looking at a software from the point of view of its unit tests often provides great insights on the architecture and the point of frictions.\n\nA common issue in unit tests is the overuse of mocks and stubs. This most often caused by a design where objects have too many responsibilities and/or dependencies, and side effects. The components of such a system are hard to test, hence the need for mocks.\n\nIn contrast with such objects, code that uses concepts from the functional programming world such as immutability and pure functions is easier and safer to test.\n\nSuch functional code can be used to write highly testable and easy to work with application, with the help of functional reactive programming frameworks like ReactiveCocoa or RxSwift. This is the concept of “functional core, reactive shell”.\n\nSoftware written in such way might look unconventional, and has a bit of a learning curve. The talk is to show that the advantages it brings make it a viable choice.\n\nGio is an iOS testing and automation consultant based in Melbourne. He and writes on such topics on http://mokacoding.com, and he is looking forward to hear how teams are approaching unit testing and which infrastructure they are using. Gio is always researching something new to learn, from functional programming, to cosmology and solving the Rubik’s cube. He also is a big Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles fan.\n\nFor more on YOW!
