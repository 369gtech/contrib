title: 'Why your next project should use Elixir - Andreas Ronge'
recordingDate: 1550669467
description: "Elixir is a wonderful functional language with high quality tools and libraries.\n\nIt runs on the Erlang VM which has been used for decades to build reliable and scalable micro services.\n\nElixir can be used in a wide range of domains, from web to embedded development.\n\nWhy Elixir ?\n\n* What if you could avoid using single page frameworks and instead spin up a stateful server for each session ?\n\n* What if you could structure your application by independent interacting servers on the Erlang VM ?\n\n* What if you could on the fly upgrade/config parts of your product without restarts ?\n\n* What if Erlang was your operating system for your embedded product and it took care of network, I/O, firmware updates in a fault tolerant way ?\n\n* What if you just needed one server to handle 2 million tcp connections or the system had an uptime of 99.9999999% ?\n\n* What if the language and tooling was optimized for development happiness ?\n\nAndreas Ronge:\nBackground as a C/Java developer since 1996 and a Ruby developer since 2008. \n\nThe last 8 years been working in various Javascript projects as a consultant.\n\nBelieve there must be a better way of developing software in 2019.\n______________________\nFoo Café is a meeting place for people with an interest in software development and IT. \n\nHere, user groups and partner companies find the perfect atmosphere for sharing knowledge and develop competence. \n\nFoo Café is open for everyone and is free to attend.
