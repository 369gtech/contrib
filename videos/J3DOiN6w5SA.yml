description: '#Codemotion Rome 2018 - In this tutorial we will teach you how DeepLearning Neural Networks work and how to use Keras on top of TensorFlow to create DeepLearning driven AI systems at scale. Without understanding every little detail of linear algebra you will be able to create and train a Convolutional Neural Network on TensorFlow using Keras and scale it on Apache Spark and GPUs using DeepLearning4J, Apache SystemML or Watson Machine Learning'
