This works fine until an application changes the shape of the events it is producing — how do consumers understand and handle the change? This is where schemas and a schema registry comes in.\nThis session will introduce the common schema formats that are used in the Kafka community and some schema registries that support these. It will also cover how to use schemas in different types of Kafka applications. Learn how to effectively [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n00:53 Barista example\n08:49 Using JSON\n10:20 Adding structure with schemas\n13:20 Schema registry\n14:07 What format to use?\n19:33 Which schema to choose?\n27:02 Serdes and converters\n34:41 Apicurio registry\n36:06 Confluent schema registry\n36:51 Summary\n37:28 Outro\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotopia.eu/february-2021/sessions/1700/streaming-with-structure\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#Streaming #ApacheKafka #Kafka #Stream #EventStreaming #KafkaStreams #EventDriven #SoftwareArchitecture #StringSerializer #JSON #ApacheAvro #KafkaRecords #Serdes #Converter #KafkaConnect #Apicurio #Confluent\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
