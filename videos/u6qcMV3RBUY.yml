title: 'Weaving Through the Mesh: Making Sense of Istio and Overlapping Technologies'
language: English
recordingDate: 1601028032
description: "Kubernetes presents exciting choices to improve our system architecture. Service meshes in particular provide a comprehensive layer that seamlessly and transparently supplies discovery, routing, circuit breaking, distributed tracing (and more!), and enables easy integration into supporting systems. In some cases, these new options overlap with familiar solutions, like Spring Cloud or an API management platform. This creates confusion. Do we replace our current systems? Or are they complementary? Letâ€™s explore how Istio addresses many of these needs and how our existing solutions might still fit into the picture.\n\nMaria Gabriella Brodi: Sr. Solution Engineer at VMware\nCora Iberkleid: Advisory Solutions Engineer at VMware\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/weaving-through-the-mesh-making-sense-of-istio-and-overlapping-technologies"
