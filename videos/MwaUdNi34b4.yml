In the Aeternity blockchain project, this has happened several times. A blockchain is very sensitive to changes because blockchains elementary are based upon hashes of terms that should match with earlier hashes. A change that causes a hash to differ could mean that people can no longer access their assets on the blockchain.\n\nRead the full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/thomas-arts/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - THOMAS ARTS\nQuickCheck expert\n\nThomas Arts co-founder and CTO of Quviq has an academic background with a PhD in theoretical computer science. Directly after his PhD, Thomas started at Ericsson's computer Science Lab on verification tools for Erlang. After a short return to academia as a professor at Chalmers, he is now fully devoted to amazing testing tools.\n\nQuviq is the company that productified QuickCheck, a tool that automatically generates tests. The tool is written in Erlang but can be used to test systems written in a variety of languages. Among other successes, it is heavily used within the telecom and automotive industry, for example for testing 5G base stations and AUTOSAR standard software. Recently Quviq has put a lot of effort in the development and testing of blockchain implementations.\n\nMore on Thomas Arts: https://codesync.global/speaker/thomas-arts/\n\n\nTHE SPEAKER - TOBIAS LINDAHL\nErlang Beard, Creator of Dialyzer\n\nTobias started his Erlang career around 2000 in the HiPE research group in Uppsala University and have been working professionally with Erlang ever since. While working on the HiPE native code compiler, he created the original Dialyzer and focused his research on type inference for dynamically typed programming languages. He then joined Klarna in the early years, before moving on to join Erik \"Happi\" Stenman in Happi Hacking. Since September 2017 Happi Hacking has been working in the æternity project, focusing on the core components of the æternity block chain, such as state trees, consensus protocol, virtual machines and the Sophia smart contract programming language.\n\nMore on Tobias Lindahl: https://codesync.global/speaker/tobias-lindahl/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM STO 19\nCode BEAM STO is powered by Code Sync.
