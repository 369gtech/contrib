You know you’ve diligently employed every ounce of your experience and knowledge over time to design a sensible application architecture, with hopefully sensible boundaries.\nBut time is now throwing new questions your way:\nAre my boundaries still sensible?\nHave any anti-patterns crept in, have I inadvertently created the dreaded distributed monolith?\nThis talk explores how network science and graph theory techniques can be applied to help gain insight into, and explore questions about your microservices architecture [...]\r\n\r\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\r\nhttps://gotober.com/2019/sessions/1128/using-graph-theory-and-network-science-to-explore-your-microservices-architecture\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOber\r\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\r\n#Microservices #SoftwareArchitecture #MicroservicesArchitecture #GraphTheory #NetworkScience\r\n\r\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\r\nAttend the next GOTO Conference near you!
