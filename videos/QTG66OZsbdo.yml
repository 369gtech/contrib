description: "Nowadays, Data Science is buzzing all over the place.\n\nBut what is a, so-called, Data Scientist?\n\nSome will argue that a Data Scientist is a person able to report and present insights in a data set. Others will say that a Data Scientist can handle a high throughput of values and expose them in services. Yet another definition includes the capacity to create meaningful visualizations on the data.\n\nHowever, we enter an age where velocity is a key. Not only the velocity of your data is high, but the time to market is shortened. Hence, the time separating the moment you receive a set of data and the time you’ll be able to deliver added value is crucial.\n\nIn this talk, we’ll review the legacy Data Science methodologies, what it meant in terms of delivered work and results.\n\nAfterwards, we’ll slightly move towards different concepts, techniques and tools that Data Scientists will have to learn and appropriate in order to accomplish their tasks in the age of Big Data."
