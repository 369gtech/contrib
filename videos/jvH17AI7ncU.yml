description: 'https://developer.oracle.com/code/online | Venkat Subramaniam: Most mainstream programming languages have adapted the functional style. We often hear why immutability is so important and how wonderful higher order functions are. These are but tools to reach a higher goal. In this presentation we will start by discussing the functional capabilities found in almost any language today, and quickly dive into the real essence of functional programming and learn how languages like Java have focused on what really matters.'
