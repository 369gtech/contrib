description: "Reject.JS 2015 – Berlin, September 24, 2015\n\nJenna Zeigen (@zeigenvektor)\n\n# What if your brain were ~*literally*~ JavaScript\n\nComputers and brains are often used as metaphors for one another, but how exactly does JavaScript stack up against the human mind? This talk will take three facets of human cognition: attention, knowledge representation, and language processing, and compare them to analogues in JavaScript: the event loop, the object and prototype system, and the parser.\n\nhttp://rejectjs.org - http://twitter.com/rejectjs\nMusic by: https://soundcloud.com/7digits\nVideo by: http://wecap.de"
