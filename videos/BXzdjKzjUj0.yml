title: 'Is structured logging really the be-all and end-all? by Leonard Gram'
recordingDate: 1550058156
description: "In the past 10 years structured logging has gone from a pipe dream to something most developers have access to. It comes with the promise of being able to slice and dice log data in real time, gleaning the necessary details of production issues in an instant. There's a backside though, indexing huge amounts of data comes with operational complexity and high cost.\n\nLets take a look at the problem from a different angle. Aiming to provide just the right amount of slicing through indexed metadata (rather than content), while saving your wallet and the backs of your operations team.\n\nI will reason about a possible design and how it supplements and improves upon existing solutions."
