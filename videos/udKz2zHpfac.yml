description: "Wearables contribute to Big Data and the insights are already realizing significant gains in key industries:\n\nHealth – Provides a gateway for all kinds of non-invasive and ingestible monitoring: pulse, bp, skin impedance, oxygen concentration, alcohol level. The results have seen a 56% increase in patient satisfaction and 3000 hours of care time conserved.\n\nFashion-Retail – Signaling between outfits, say, letting everyone wearing the same cause-related shirt know when they are close by, or, warning everyone wearing the same cocktail dress at an event in case they want to stay away from each other.\n\nSensory enhancements – Bone-induction hearing, nail polish that detects drugged beverages. Early metrics cite 17% reduction in crime.\n\nEach of these new middlemen have three things in common: (1) they are fully exploiting a confluence of data science, mobile and social infrastructure; (2) their efforts are less than two years old; and, (3) the results are nothing short of transformational.\n\nThe examples I offer, the fifth largest city in the U.S., one of the largest medical research centers in the world and a local SF clothier with now global reach, are upending their industries. We have hit a techno-behaviorial tipping point.\n\nWatch more from Strata + Hadoop San Jose 2015: http://goo.gl/k9J3GB\nVisit the conference website to learn more: http://strataconf.com/big-data-conference-ca-2015/\nSubscribe to O’Reilly on YouTube! http://goo.gl/szEauh\n\nStay Connected to O'Reilly Media by Email - http://goo.gl/YZSWbO\nFollow O'Reilly Media:\nhttp://plus.google.com/+oreillymedia\nhttps://www.facebook.com/OReilly\nhttps://twitter.com/OReillyMedia\n\nAbout Lisa Hammitt (Salesforce):\nLisa Hammitt is a senior software executive with 25 years of industry experience.
