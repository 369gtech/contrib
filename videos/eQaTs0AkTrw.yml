description: "GoWayFest 3.0, Minsk – July 5, 2019\nGeneral Partner - SoftSwiss (https://www.softswiss.com/)\nVideo Partner - SEMrush (https://www.semrush.com/company/)\n\nDeploying Go Functions, Julien Bisconti\n\nDevelopers are taught to write code but what about deploying code? Using a serverless architecture, testing, building, deploying and monitoring are activities that happens in a cloud native environment. Coding is still done locally. What can we do to enable developers in the cloud? \nServerless enables to use services rather than running them ourselves or even building them. Writing code is actually a small part of the work, deploying and maintaining is often unknown which scares most developers. \"Deploying Go Functions\" is a talk to enable developers to shift mental model and explore (and maybe even build) their own serverless framework. It uses Go and OpenFaas in live demo to show that it is within the reach of most developers with a few lines of code and a different architecture.\n\nSlides – https://www.slideshare.net/julienbisconti/deploying-go-functions"
