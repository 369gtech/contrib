The BLOODHOUND Project is a global Engineering Adventure, using a 1000mph world land speed record attempt to inspire the next generation to enjoy, explore and get involved in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Oracle are providing the Bloodhound team with a real-time view of how different components and technologies in the car are performing. The Bloodhound engineers need fast data and even faster insights to fine-tune what is a unique, prototype vehicle pushing the limits of computer design and material technology. Our solutions will provide the foundation for these insights over the next two years. We look forward to seeing Bloodhound set a new benchmark for human ingenuity, discovery and speed as they drive STEM education around the world."
