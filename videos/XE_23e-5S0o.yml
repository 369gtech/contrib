title: 'Codemotion Deep Learning Conference 2020: Understanding Medicine Through the Eyes of ML, Tarry Singh'
language: English
recordingDate: 1592419784
description: "Understanding Medicine Through the Eyes of Machine Learning\nMedicine and healthcare is probably the single-most defining topic of today. With covid19, the best healthcare institutions have been exposed to dangers of an invisible enemy that has played havoc in our day-to-day lives. But healthcare, sadly, is also a field that has been using technology rather sparingly. There are several reasons behind it: It is a closed domain and is extremely compartmentalized in its own sub-domains, second â€“ machine learning and deep learning is still viewed with scepticism within the medical community and for good reason. In this talk, Tarry will guide you through his own personal journey on how he accidentally started exploring the datasets a few years ago. One thing led to the other, after several AI for Med projects and after launching a healthcare startup, today he is one of the founding members for Focus Group for AI with ITU/World Health Organization.\n\nSpeaker: Tarry Singh, CEO & Co-founder, deepkapha.ai"
