recordingDate: 1433025697
description: "From Velocity Santa Clara 2015: Forty years ago, a new startup named Microsoft changed the world of personal computing software. Today, Microsoft is behaving like the biggest startup on the planet. Microsoft is committed to making software that delights developers and IT pros alike, enabling our customers to be productive anywhere on any device. Jessica and Jennelle will show you how Microsoft, a force in the market for four decades, continues to innovate and reinvent itself on a massive scale.\n\nThis keynote is sponsored by Microsoft.\n\nAbout Jessica DeVita (Microsoft):\nJessica DeVita is a recovering sysadmin, in IT operations for about 18 years, seven years in corporate IT and almost 10 in private consulting. She is a technical evangelist at Microsoft, helping IT operations staff uplevel their technical and soft skills for DevOps and cloud computing. She enjoys building and participating in communities and meetups, and supporting non-profits that teach technology and programming skills to women, girls, and those in underserved communities.\n\nJessica founded the consulting firm UberGeekGirl, helping startups and music industry clients establish their IT strategy, support their infrastructure, hire staff, automate operations, and build a better relationship with their network, data, and the general computing experience. Her areas of expertise include cloud and SaaS strategy, consulting and implementation, hosted exchange, migrations, mobile device management (MDM), BYOD and CYOD, mixed Mac/PC networks, VOIP, CRM, and collaboration systems; for both open source and enterprise platforms.\n\nAbout Janelle Crothers (MIcrosoft):\nBefore joining Microsoft, Jennelle Crothers spent 15 years as a systems administrator “jack of all trades” overseeing Windows domains, Exchange Server, desktops, and other IT infrastructure systems, where she struck fear into the hearts of end users with complex password policies and email retention tags. As a technology evangelist for IT professionals, she speaks to members of the IT community about what’s new and cool with Microsoft technologies. When not reading something related to technology, Jennelle helps raise puppies for Guide Dogs for the Blind and enjoys reading dystopian novels. One of these days, she’ll finish that quilt she started in 2011. Follow her on Twitter @jkc137 or visit her personal blog at www.techbunny.com."
