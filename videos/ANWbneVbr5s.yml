title: 'Webinar: Kubernetes RBAC 101'
language: English
recordingDate: 1587700665
description: "Incredibly powerful and flexible, Kubernetes role-based access control (RBAC) is an essential tool to effectively manage production clusters. Yet many Ops and DevOps engineers are still facing barriers to efficiently use it at scale. These include a steep learning curve, YAML-based configuration, lack of standardized best practices, and the general complexity of this functionality at large — it truly can be somewhat overwhelming. During this webinar, Oleg, CTO at Kublr, will discuss Kubernetes RBAC concepts and objects. He’ll explore different use cases ranging from simple permission management for in-cluster application accounts to integrations with external identity providers for SSO and enterprise user access management.\n\nPresenter: Oleg Chunikhin, CTO @Kublr"
