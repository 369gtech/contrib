description: "Theo Schlossnagle, Circonus\n\nMost SRE techniques revolve around resiliency and reliability of service delivery. Most \"product\" is the type of product that is deployed, not shipped. At Circonus, we deal with a lot of on-premise software shipment due to hybrid customer requirements. It turns out that many SRE techniques can apply directly to the construction, packaging, and shipment of installed software as well. In this talk, we'll learn all about it.\n\nAt Circonus we build a large, complicated, quickly-changing product. It has a lot of moving parts and all of the typical challenges diagnosing and fixing issues that arise from complex and distributed systems. To add pain to this common challenge, we also ship the whole product stack to run on-premise \"behind the air-gap.\" It is the same product. As you can imagine, the challenges here are many. How do you allow high-velocity, risk-managed development that results in many production releases daily and have the resulting product packaged for on-premise installation at the same time? I will articulate what I believe are the techniques from SRE that make this possible.\n\nView the full SREcon19 Asia/Pacific program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon19asia/program.\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
