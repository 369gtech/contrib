And more about helping each other achieve the extraordinary.\n\nThe second quality is organizations that treat and expect their employees to act like owners. Owning not just their behaviors, actions, and responsibilities, but owning outcomes and becoming a voice for the organization.\n\nNo matter where your organization is at today, the good news is– there are proven strategies to create a culture of collaborative ownership at your organization and that’s what I’m going to teach you in this course.\n\nI’ll share how you can build momentum from a carefully crafted vision and goals, I’ll help you improve communication and drive ownership, I’ll help you foster creativity, and finally, I’ll help you train up leaders in your organization and help you meet more of your goals.\n\nSo, if you’re ready to transform your organization. let’s go!\n\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES:\n\nAttendees will learn: How to transform a command-obey dynamic to one of creativity and innovation through opportunities for ownership.
