description: "In this free series, I'll be teaching GraphQL with Apollo, Meteor & React to build a full-stack app.\n\nSeries code repo: https://github.com/leveluptuts/fullstack-graphql-apollo-react-meteor\n\nSyntax Podcast ft Scott Tolinski & Wes Bos: https://goo.gl/7jDDxX\n\nhttps://www.leveluptutorials.com/pro\n\nSubscribe for more free tutorials https://goo.gl/6ljoFc\n\nThe best shared web hosting\nhttp://www.bluehost.com/track/leveluptutorials/\n\nSubscribe to the Level Up Newsletter\nhttp://eepurl.com/AWjGz\n\nApollo provides a universal GraphQL API on top of your existing services, so you can build new application features fast without waiting on backend changes.\n\nBuild and update application features without writing new endpoints. Just write a GraphQL query and Apollo gets the data for you.\n\nBest of all, Apollo integrates with the technology you're already using, so you can add it a little bit at a time. It also works with the whole specification and all community GraphQL tools."
