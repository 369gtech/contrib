recordingDate: 1541668607
description: "Apache Kafka is a very popular choice publish/subscribe messaging and event streaming in modern Cloud Native application. These reactive and event-driven applications are increasingly containerised and deployed to Kubernetes. This session will cover the practical aspects of deploying Kafka to a Kubernetes environment, from configuring resources to deploying applications.\n\nWe will show an example deployment of Kafka on Kubernetes, including the Kubernetes objects to use and the resource considerations you must make when configuring your deployment. The session will highlight useful metrics to consider when creating Kubernetes health checks and pitfalls to avoid.\n\nFinally we will demonstrate how to connect an application to your Kafka deployment. This will include the additional objects required to expose Kafka to applications running externally to your Kubernetes cluster.\n\nVoxxed Days Microservices 2018: 2 days conference (+1 optional workshops day) only on Microservices. \n\nFollow us on :\nWebsite : https://voxxeddays.com/microservices (bit.ly/vxdmicro)\nTwitter : https://twitter.com/vxdmicroservice\nLinkedin : https://www.linkedin.com/in/voxxed-days-microservices-906115164\nKeep in touch : https://t.co/pxf7cHZOpl\n\n#developers #conference #microservices"
