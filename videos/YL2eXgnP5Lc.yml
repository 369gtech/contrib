description: "The Remote Working Security Conundrum: What Is Reasonably Secure Anyway?\n\nAlex Sharp, OrionVM\n\nSecuring a remote work environment presents a unique set of challenges: from possibly adversarial networks and insecure physical environments through to authentication and segmentation hurdles. This talk runs through the stack, from physical security through to the application layer, highlighting interesting, important, or novel technology choices we made and the reasoning behind them. Examples include the use of QubesOS to allow virtualization to segment potentially sensitive web browsers, or the heads firmware image to secure the boot environment via the TPM.\n\nView the full LISA21 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa21/program"
