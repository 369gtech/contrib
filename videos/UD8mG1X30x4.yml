title: 'Phase 4 - Status update on the AMSAT Geosynchronous satellite effort'
recordingDate: 1484832227
description: "Steve Conklin\nhttp://linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/58/\nPhase 4 is the designation for Geosynchronous Amateur Satellites. AMSAT US is working to design, fund, build, and launch a geosynchronous satellite. This satellite will provide voice and data connections to amateur radio operators within the satellite ground 'footprint', and may have a large impact in enabling disaster communications from areas with no intact telecommunications infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThe initial effort is for a single satellite which will be stationed over the Northern Hemisphere, but if the project is successful it could expand to more satellites.\r\n\r\nSteve Conklin is a member of the ground station engineering team. The goal is to design a complete ground station that is very portable and can be carried and set up by a single person, for under $1000 USD. The ground station is open hardware and software.\r\n\r\nThis talk will present project goals, current status, and projected schedule."
