description: 'Writing software to be used by people in different cultures can be a lot of work, with lots of extra boiler plate in many different languages. But things don’t have to be that difficult or messy. Come to find about the new Raku modules that can make internationalization a painless process. Leave knowing how to work with language tags, localization frameworks, special tokens for regexen, and Unicode’s CLDR in a way that is both fully standards-compliant and 100% Raku-ish.'
