description: "We call them different things, communities, tribes, groups... But they all intersect. \nWe will take a look at how they are built up, but also how they differ and why they sometimes die away.  \n\n\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry in the Malmö/Lund region. Foo Café is aimed at those interested in sharing, learning and creating. \nJoin the fun at foocafe.org"
