description: "Further information: https://foss-backstage.de/session/mentoring-p2p-case-clinic-working-out-loud\n\nIn a world strongly demanding self-organization and participation, there is an urgent need for mentoring ways that didn't originate in traditional HR or top-down approaches. Peer coaching methods will become the foundation of independent and self-paced advancement and will also facilitate networking within companies and even beyond.\n\nI will introduce two techniques that are available for everyone, quickly realizable, and yet location- and equipment-independently usable - the Presencing Institute's \"Case Clinic\" and John Stepper's \"Working Out Loud\"."
