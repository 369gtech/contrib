recordingDate: 1525431277
description: '#Codemotion Rome 2018 - Due to its permissionless nature, which makes nodes coordination practically impossible, upgrading the Bitcoin protocol preserving backward compatibility can be very hard. This often leads to the development of very complex solutions to very simple problems and, in some cases, limits the freedom to add new features to the Bitcoin protocol. In this talk we will analyze the complexities of such upgrades, basing our analysis on past approaches and how they evolved in time.'
