description: "There are many exciting things happening with AI, from which, until recently, JavaScript developers were largely shut out.\n\nBut things are changing, if you can do `npm install @tensorflow/tfjs` or make an API call, you can now do AI. In this fast-paced talk, I'll open your mind to what's possible by demoing several AI-powered JavaScript apps and show you how they were built using either TensorFlow.js or easy to use AI-powered APIs. You don't need a PhD in Maths, you don't need years of experience, you just need imagination and the willingness to try.\n\nSlides: https://speakerdeck.com/jawache/yglf-2019\n\nYGLF 2019: Code Camp Blog - Assim Hussain:\nhttps://www.israel.yglfconf.com/post/meet-the-speaker-asim-hussain"
