description: "\"Full blown virtual machine or containers seems to be a huge question today. But there is an often ignored option: Unikernels. These are minimal kernels thatare just built to support just one application on top of a hypervisor. Insteadof having an additional kernel layer like containers, they work by never providing things an app doesn't need and rely on hypervisors for isolation.Like containers, the idea is not new, but the first implementations are comingto a practically usable state. Which leaves us with a question: how do we develop software on top of them?\nThis introduces you to the rumprun unikernel and development on it. It features examples as well as a comparison with other systems.\""
