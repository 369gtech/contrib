description: "by Wiebe-Marten Wijnja\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/AW1.121/beam_going_meta_elixir_macros.webm\n\nCompilation and execution are as different as night and day. Or are they? By blurring the lines, Elixir (and the BEAM VM) enable some very powerful and useful meta-programming techniques.\n\n\nIn this presentation, Marten will talk about running and generating code at compile-time, Elixir's hygienic macros, and how to compile and hot-reload altered or extra code, while your program is running!\nBesides explaining these concepts, their usefulness will be motivated using various practical real-world examples.\n\nRoom: AW1.121\nScheduled start: 2020-02-01 12:30:00"
