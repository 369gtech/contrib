title: 'Webinar: End YAML engineering with cdk8s!'
language: English
recordingDate: 1589400868
description: "The CDK for Kubernetes (cdk8s) is a new open-source software development framework for defining Kubernetes applications and resources using familiar programming languages.\n\nApplications running on Kubernetes are composed of dozens of resources maintained through carefully maintained YAML files. As applications evolve and teams grow, these YAML files become harder and harder to manage. It’s also really hard to reuse and create abstractions through config files — copying & pasting from previous projects is not the solution!\n\nIn this webinar, the creators of cdk8s show you how to define your first cdk8s application, define reusable components called “constructs” and generally say goodbye (and thank you very much) to writing in YAML.\n\nBring your laptops set up with your favorite development environment in one of the supported languages (TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Java and .NET).\n\nPresenter:\n\nElad Ben-Israel, Principal Software Engineer @AWS, Developer Tools\nNathan Taber, Senior Product Manager @AWS, Kubernetes"
