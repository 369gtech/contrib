description: "Google Tech Talks\nJanuary 13, 2009\n\nABSTRACT\n\nBroadcast television's analog to digital DTV transition is a technology event touching every American household. On February 17, full power TV stations around the nation will cease over the air transmission of analog television and transmit only digital. Analog TV sets in low-income, non-English speaker, disabled and other households receiving TV over the air will no longer function unless steps are taken to maintain reception after the transition, for example by using a digital converter device. Technical and logistical challenges associated with the DTV transition are expected to impact these households hardest. James Miller, Attorney Advisor at the FCC, will discuss these issues and how this unprecedented technical change offers tech-savvy volunteers an opportunity to share expertise and make a difference to people in need, while learning more about the wireless engineering aspects of broadcast TV.\n\nSpeaker: James Miller\nBiography James Miller is an Attorney Advisor of the Policy and Rules Division of the Office of Engineering and Technology at the Federal Communications Commission, Adjunct Professor of Law at the American University, Washington College of Law, and past 2004-2006 Mansfield Fellow.
