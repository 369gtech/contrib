description: "Katie will talk about 2016's MegaPixel project, in which a giant RGB colour photograph was made by a team of mathematicians, coders and volunteers using red, green and blue marker pens, acetate, a webcam and a small pile of code. Come and listen to find out how it worked, whether it succeeded and how you can make your own mini-MegaPixel image (to make the office across the way jealous).\n\nKatie Steckles is a mathematician based in Manchester, who gives talks and workshops on different areas of maths. She finished her PhD in 2011, and since then has talked about maths in schools, at science festivals, on BBC radio, at music festivals, as part of theatre shows and on the internet. She enjoys doing puzzles, solving the Rubik's cube and baking things shaped like maths."
