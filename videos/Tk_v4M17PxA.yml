description: "It finally happened: tired of mutable data structures and thread synchronization, we decided to use functional programming and F# for the next generation of our system. Gigabytes of data are going through our applications every hour with high demand for performance, scalability, and failure recovery.\n\nThe fact that our project has for a long time been in production can identify it as a success, but has the choice of FP become an essential part of this success? Could we achieve similar development speed and operational stability if we settled for OOP (and C# on the .NET platform)?\n\nWe believe that functional programming provides a set of defaults that can give significant advantages for development with short deadlines and continuous deployment, and we are going to share our experience and lessons learned in this talk."
