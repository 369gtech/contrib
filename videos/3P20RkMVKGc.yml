title: 'Julie Lerman - Dev and Test Agility for your Database with Docker'
recordingDate: 1557801444
description: 'Agile practices teach us how to deal with evolving applications but so often the data store is overlooked as a component of your application lifecycle. Database servers are monolothic, resource intensive and mostly viewed as set in stone. Encapsulating your database server in a container and your database in a storage container can dramatically lighten the load and make your database as agile as your model and other processes. And you can even use a serious enterprise class database like SQL Server this way. This session will show how to benefit from using a containerized version of SQL Server for Linux during development and testing. We''ll also address concerns about data that needs to be persisted. You''ll also get a peek at the DevOps side of this, including using images in your CI/CD process. - Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/channel/craftconf1'
