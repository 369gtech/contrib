description: "Google's Santa Tracker for Android is now open source on GitHub at https://github.com/google/santa-tracker-android. To help with user engagement, the app uses the App Indexing API (http://goo.gl/aZABr2) to enable autocomplete support for Santa Tracker games from Google Search. This is done using deep linking. In this video, Jarek Wilkiewicz demonstrates how the feature works in Santa Tracker, and explains how you can implement it in your own Android app. \n\nWatch the Google Search video playlist at: http://goo.gl/I7G16Y\n\nSubscribe to the Google Developers channel at: http://goo.gl/mQyv5L"
