The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\n10 More Weird Ways to Blow Up Your Kubernetes - Jian Cheung & Joseph Kim, Airbnb \n\nOver the past couple of years, Airbnb has standardized microservices, containerization, Kubernetes, and service mesh in our ecosystem, and have built tools around it to make our workloads more robust. We’ve seen great results with thousands of services now aboard Kubernetes, but it wasn’t without mistakes and painful/insightful learnings along the way. Airbnb is back at KubeCon again to share 10 more ways we’ve messed up in just the past year -- come discover what can go wrong as we share some of our experiences running on Kubernetes. Favorites include: - “What do you mean CPU Limits caused OOM-kills?” - “Half the pods are gone and this was broken for 7 days?” - “Yes, things do break when all the masters are down” And more! \n\nhttps://sched.co/ek9r"
