title: 'OML feature highlight: OML AutoML UI for Automated Model Building'
language: English
recordingDate: 1617416790
description: "Join us to learn and see a live demo of a new feature of Oracle Machine Learning on Autonomous Database:  OML AutoML UI.\n\nThe OML AutoML User Interface (UI) makes machine learning easy.  AutoML UI provides an easy to use UI that automates repetitive, time-consuming tasks typically taken by data scientists, simplifies machine learning for non-expert users and accelerates the entire machine learning process from model building to model deployment.  \n\nWith just a few “clicks”, users specify a table and the target attribute and AutoML UI given their business problem and data builds a model for you. \n\nAutoML UI automatically preprocesses the data, picks the best candidate algorithm(s) that suits the defined task from OML’s library of available algorithms, selects the right number of input data samples and features to speed up model tuning.  \n\nAutoML UI builds OML models using the identified algorithms, tunes the hyperparameters and displays accuracy metrics so users can select the best model.\n\nhttps://developer.oracle.com/"
