We'll cover what needs to be modified to add an option to an existing command (grammar, execution, etc) and the major components of PG (parser, commands, memory management, etc). We'll also cover the PG style guidelines, a crash-course on using git, how to submit your patch, and the review/commitfest process. \n\nRoom: UA2.220 (Guillissen)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 11:00:00+01"
