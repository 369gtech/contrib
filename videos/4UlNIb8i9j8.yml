description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2012\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nMarijn Haverbeke - Author of Eloquent JavaScript, main CodeMirror hacker, prolific coder\n\nABSTRACT\nJavaScript-based text editors have come a long way in the past few years. In this talk, I will outline what is possible today, and show how several open-source implementations make it quick and painless to embed a serious editor in a Web application. I will then dive deeply into the techniques that are used to implement CodeMirror, my own project.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
