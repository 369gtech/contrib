title: 'Refactoring to Immutability - Kevlin Henney'
recordingDate: 1518702642
description: "It has been said that immutability changes everything. But what does that mean in practice? What does it mean for existing code that looks more like the mutant apocalypse than an elegant application of mathematical thinking?\n\nImmutability can be an ideal that is hard to reach. Refactoring, on the other hand, is all about the art of the possible. In this talk we'll be clarifying motivation and exploring some approaches to help reducing state mutability in code."
