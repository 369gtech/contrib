description: "PyData Berlin 2018\n\nNeural networks are complicated, multidimensional, nonlinear array operations. How can we present them in a way that is clear, didactic and insightful? (Bonus points if it is beautiful as well!) I will present an overview of tools and techniques for visualizing whole networks and particular blocks, including my project (ASCII diagrams of Keras models) and proposing new solutions.\n\nSlides: https://www.dropbox.com/s/a7xako61ihuh82k/20180707_network_viz_pydata_berlin.pdf?dl=0\n---\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
