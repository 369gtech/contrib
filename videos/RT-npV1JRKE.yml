title: 'Breaking Dependencies: The SOLID Principles'
language: English
recordingDate: 1634659760
description: "SOLID is an abbreviation for five of the most important software design principles:\n- (S)ingle Responsibility Principle\n- (O)pen-Closed Principle\n- (L)iskov Substitution Principle\n- (I)nterface Segregation Principle\n- (D)ependency Inversion Principle\n\n\nFor almost two decades, these principles have proven to be a valuable set of guidelines to cope with software dependencies. Although initially introduced as guidelines for object-oriented programming, they have become a universal set of guidelines that can be used equally well for procedural, functional or generic programming. In this talk I'll recap the SOLID principles and explain why they form such a valuable set of universal design guidelines. Also, I'll go into detail about several common misconceptions.\n\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nCppCon Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish CppCon tech talks. \n\n\nCREDITS:\nCppCon YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMlGfpWw-RUdWX_JbLCukXg"
