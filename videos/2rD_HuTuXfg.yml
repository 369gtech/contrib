description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2015.\nSpeaker: Matt Raible\nWeb / JavaScript Track\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/comparing-hot-javascript-frameworks\nJavaScript MVC Frameworks are all the rage these days. They’ve taken the web development world by storm. This session explores the various features of the three hottest JavaScript MVC frameworks: AngularJS, Ember.js and React.js. It also compares client-side templating vs. server-side templating and how well each framework supports Isomorphic JavaScript (code that can run both client-side and server-side). Finally, we’ll rank each framework on 10 different criteria using Yevgeniy Brikman’s scorecard."
