description: "Beauty in Code 2018 was a single-track full day IT-conference held at the Malmö Live conference center on March 3, 2018, featuring seven different speakers from three continents.\nLouis Hansen about his session \"Software professionals, we keep using that word...\": We constantly refer to Software Development, and the people in this field, as professionals, but are we really? Are we held sufficiently accountable for the things we build? And should we be? This talk will go through what it means to be a profession in the classical definition. We will look at what parts we already have in our field, and why we might want to strive for certain other aspects."
