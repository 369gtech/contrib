description: "RESTler, the first stateful REST API fuzzer brought to life by Microsoft Partner Researcher Patrice Godefroid and Microsoft Engineer Marina Polishchuk. \n\nThe RESTler tool takes as input an OpenAPI specification of a REST API and then automatically creates and executes tests, without any pre-recorded API traffic, in order to find bugs in the cloud services behind that REST API. This is done using two components, a compiler, and a test engine, that work together to generate and execute tests. Fuzzing with RESTler is already being adopted by Microsoft Engineers working on cloud-based products like Azure, Office365 and Bing services, and it is helping them find bugs in their systems.\n\nRead the full research paper here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2021/03/RESTler.pdf \n\nYou can learn more about the project: https://github.com/microsoft/rest-api-fuzz-testing \n\nTo learn more about the latest Dev breakthroughs, visit the Innovation Tech Hub: https://innovation.microsoft.com/en-us/developer\n\nDiscover all the Innovation Tech Minutes for Developers: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrxD0HtieHjNJcVCIktce-wSFZ5svwA3"
