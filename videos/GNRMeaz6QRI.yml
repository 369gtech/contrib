description: 'In this show, we''ll do some live examples of how to best use the API reference for V3 version of the YouTube Data API. We''ll discuss the way the API is structured, how to use the API explorer, and how to translate what we see in the API explorer into Java and Python code. A bonus? The steps we follow in this show will also translate well to other Google APIs, such as Drive, Compute Engine and other APIs available via the Google API Console!'
