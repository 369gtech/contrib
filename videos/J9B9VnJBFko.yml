description: "In many organisations the strongest impediments to achieving greatness exist outside of development teams. Teams do the best they can within the constraints of their environment. Understandably, we often focus our energy and attention on addressing issues within our perceived sphere of influence. Teams improve their engineering practices. They work at the way they communicate with each other. They improve their technology. And whilst all of those improvements will deliver value, they can only take us so far. If the wider organisation is holding us back then that is where we need to catalyse change.\n\nAbout the speaker: Colin is Lead Agile Coach at Treatwell where he is helping teams in Vilnius and London to build the worldâ€™s leading hair and beauty marketplace. Prior to this, Colin spent 18 years or so leading and coaching teams at companies including IBM, lastminute.com and Huddle. He is especially interested in the relationship between organisational culture and the adoption of Agile values and principles. But most of all, Colin gets a kick out of helping teams to become Harder, Better, Faster Stronger!\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/colingrossman/"
