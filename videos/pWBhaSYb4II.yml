description: "Spring I/O 2016 - 19 -20 May Barcelona\n\nWe all love meetups but it's sometimes hard to find ones that are relevant and exciting. That's why we can use Meetup.com's data APIs to seed a graph database.\n\nWith the data in the graph, recommending relevant meetup groups and events is a breeze. We write a small recommendation engine application using Spring Boot and Spring Data Neo4j.\nAnd the best thing - you can do it too, with any kind of Web-APIs or other data source."
