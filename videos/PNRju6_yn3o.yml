description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2017\n—\nAssume, we implement a very simple class having just multiple string members. Even ordinary application programmer prefer to make it simple and fast. \n\nYou think you know how to do it? Well beware! It can become a lot harder than you initially might assume. \n\nSo, let’s look at a trivial class with multiple string members and use live coding to see the effect using different implementation approaches (using constructors passing by value, by reference, by perfect forwarding, or doing more sophisticated tricks). \n\nSooner than later we will fall into the deep darkness of universal/forwarding references, enable_if, type traits, and concepts.\n— \nNicolai Josuttis: IT Communication\n\nNicolai Josuttis (http://www.josuttis.com) is an independent system architect, technical manager, author, and consultant. He designs mid-sized and large software systems for the telecommunications, traffic, finance, and manufacturing industries.\n\nHe is well known in the programming community because he not only speaks and writes with authority (being the (co-)author of the world-wide best sellers The C++ Standard Library (www.cppstdlib.com), C++ Templates, and SOA in Practice), but is also an innovative presenter, having talked at various conferences and events.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
