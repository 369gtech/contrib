description: "??ATTENTION ??\nRegistration to ?DevTernity 2018 is running:\n? https://devternity.com\n\nWix.com started the journey toward DevOps and a microservices solution about 5 years ago when we switched from a monolithic application to a microservices-based system—a transition that took two full years to complete, with many lessons learned along the way. Today, Wix successfully operates over 200 microservices on a battle-tested production environment. In this talk, we will cover why Continuous Delivery and DevOps are important requirements for microservices, discuss guidelines for a good microservice architecture, explain why YAGNI and KISS are important and how operational concerns (DevOps) affect the design of a microservices architecture, as well as give some recommendations on the best way to transition from a monolithic to a microservices architecture."
