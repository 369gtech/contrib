description: "Talk recording from JSNation Live 2020, the biggest JavaScript conference in the cloud: https://live.jsnation.com\n\n# When Worlds Collide: Frontend vs Database \n\nClassic frontend vs backend API design conflicts are becoming a headache of the past with serverless and Jamstack architectures and tools; frontend developers are building the full stack. But this poses a new problem: “What database? Who cares about the database?” This talk will help you with the questions you should ask of the database for your next side project...and a place to begin your journey in database internals."
