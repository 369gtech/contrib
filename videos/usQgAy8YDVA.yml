description: "Cornelius Schumacher works for SUSE Linux as a senior software developer and engineering manager,  and has been an open source contributor for more than a decade. \n\nThough git doesn't support pair programming natively, there are workarounds and best practices around how to do productive pair programming with git. This presentation will give an overview of how this works, with practical insights from one of the biggest open source projects using pair programming as its primary means of development. It will include a sketch and discussion about how git could get native support for pair programming.\n\nAbout GitMerge\nGit Merge is the pre-eminent Git-focused conference: a full-day offering technical content and user case studies, plus a day of workshops for Git users of all levels. Git Merge is dedicated to amplifying new voices in the Git community and to showcasing the most thought-provoking projects from contributors, maintainers and community managers around the world.
