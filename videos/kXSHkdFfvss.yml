description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nContinuous Documentation Manifesto - Omer Rosenbaum, Swimm\n\nWe have continuous integration/delivery but why not continuous documentation? This would particularly help onboard new members to code bases. The current status quo for sharing engineering knowledge within teams is broken. Code documentation requires new methods and tools to improve team efficiency and productivity. Continuous Documentation is a new paradigm for creating and maintaining code documentation that involves incorporating it into the normal development workflow. The principles of Continuous Documentation require that documentation be always up-to-date; be created at the most opportune time; and be tightly coupled with the code. By practicing Continuous Documentation we can get high-quality documentation that actually works for developers, guiding them through the code base, while speeding up development and improving agility."
