Although we get fairly good results with recommendations based on product metadata, for some products the metadata is just not granular enough to produce good results. In particular, \"material: wood, color: brown\" matches a wide variety of products that don’t actually fit together from a human perspective.\n\nTo make up for this deficit, we found a way to augment our algorithms with product images - analysing the colors in each image to recommend products that match well visually."
