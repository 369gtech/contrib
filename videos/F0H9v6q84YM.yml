description: "Agile/Dawie Ruined My Life\n\nDawie Olivier, CIO, Westpac New Zealand \n\nMoving from the shadow of the valley of death to a culture of velocity, engagement and quality engineering is a hard and complicated journey. The temptation is to start with the methods, tools and techniques that drive the modern DevOps organisation. This is the story of what happens when you start with the people and culture before anything else, and the magic that breaks out when we then add the velocity.\n\nDOES17 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
