description: "Embeddings! Embeddings everywhere! - How to build a recommender system using representation learning.\n\nSlides - https://www.slideshare.net/arciuchm/embeddings-embeddings-everywhere-156063776\n\nRecommender systems are the major source of income of modern e-commerce. In this talk we will describe a large scale (over 90 millions items and 20 million registered users) e-commerce recommender system used at Allegro. The system is composed of two main parts: learning item representations and finding nearest neighbours. We will share the experience we gained from building the system.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.
