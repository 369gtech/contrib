description: "Let's talk about how JavaSript/Node.js development could benefit from low-code.\n\nIt used to be that we measured programmersâ€™ productivity by counting lines of code. Yet, in a recent interview, Elon Musk declared that the best developers accomplish their goals with as little code as possible. Having less code certainly does increase flexibility and reduces technical debt!\n\nBut how do you get things done by writing less code rather than more? In this session, I'd like to explore the new Low-code / No-code movement and why the idea of writing less code might just make sense for you!"
