In this lightning talk Chris will examine his favourite ones, discuss alternative ways to think about serverless technologies, and how this alternative thinking may change the approach to your next project. We’ll explore some useful analogies, and a technique for identifying if a serverless architecture is right for your project, driven by hard data.\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
