description: "So you want to run FFMpeg or ImageMagick or any other third-party processing library inside your Production environment, and still hope for a good nightâ€™s sleep?\n\nIn-house third-party code execution has its unique set of security challenges. One cannot help but wonder how the \"ImageTragick\" bug got so infamously popular in affecting the production state of security for so many enterprises worldwide.\n\nHistorically speaking, such third-party libraries have been subject to several critical security impacting vulnerabilities, including but not limited to, remote code execution attacks. When coupled with untrusted user-provided inputs, execution of such dangerous executables can become a nightmare for security teams to thoroughly secure.\n\nAs in-house execution of untrusted code becomes more prevalent, a secure-by-design framework is necessary to help guide organizations to better safeguard their production state of security.  In this talk, I would like to present a framework that was incepted on the basis of security best practices and defense-in-depth principles, and can be leveraged to secure third-party code execution environments.  \n\n\nMukul Khullar\nStaff Security Engineer, LinkedIn\nMukul Khullar is a security researcher with over 9 years of industry experience, primarily focused on application security and penetration testing.
