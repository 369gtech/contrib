description: "To get your questions answered, head over to http://aka.ms/powerfuldevsconf to check the agenda and chat with the developers via https://aka.ms/powerfuldevto\n\nNot every application that a professional developer builds should be code first. Join us on July 15th for POWERful Devs, the first virtual conference of its kind. We will showcase how developers can leverage the Power Platform to build applications faster and with far less effort. Connect with industry-recognized ProDev influencers, Microsoft Cloud Advocates, trusted and diverse community leaders, and members of the Power Platform Team."
