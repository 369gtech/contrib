title: 'Java-based microservices, containers, Kubernetes - How To'
recordingDate: 1456224748
description: "(Recorded at Jfokus 2016. http://www.jfokus.com)\n\nJava-based microservices, containers, Kubernetes - How To\n\nJoin this session to learn how to create a microservice using Spring Boot, containerize it using Maven plugins, and subsequently deploy a fleet of microservices and dependent components such as Redis using Kubernetes. Spring Boot makes creating microservices fast and easy when it comes to running a single instance. Like most Java applications, the harder part is usually the clustering and fail-over configurations. First, we'll go over how to get started with Spring Boot, and, subsequently, using Maven plugins to generate and create Docker images during the build process. Next, we'll go over some basic architecture and configurations, such as configuring session, and container linking. Finally, with the images, we'll deploy the microservice into Kubernetes!\n\nRay Tsang, Google\n\nRay is a Developer Advocate for the Google Cloud Platform.
