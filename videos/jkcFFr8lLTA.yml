description: "Chaos Debugging: Finding and Fixing Microservice Weak Points - Idit Levine & Mitch Kelley, Solo.io \n\nDistributed microservices introduce new challenges: failure modes are harder to anticipate and resolve. In this session, we present a “Chaos Debugging” framework enabled by three open source projects: Gloo Shot, Squash, and Loop to help you increase your microservices’ “immunity” to issues.  Gloo Shot integrates with any service mesh to implement advanced, realistic chaos experiments. Squash connects powerful and mature debuggers (gdb, dlv, java debugging) to your microservices while they run in Kubernetes. Loop extends the capability of your service mesh to observe your application and record full transactions for sandboxed replay and debugging.  Come to this demo-heavy talk to see how together, Squash, Gloo Shot, and Loop allow you to trigger, replay, and investigate failure modes of your microservices in a language agnostic and efficient manner without requiring any changes to your code.   \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPXi"
