However, is it always optimal? What other choices we have? Are there any other standards than the IEEE 754 FP? In this talk I’ll present such topics as:\n\nBrief intro to the FP IEEE 754 standard, its pros, cons and pitfalls.\nHow can we compress floating point data – shorter formats, lossless & lossy compressions, new ZFP and SZ methods and their use in C++.\nA new kid on the block – the POSIT arithmetic and how to use it.\nIntro to the relevant C++ libraries and – as always – a lot of practical examples.\nEverybody is invited ;)\n\n-------\nBoguslaw Cyganek\nI'm a researcher and lecturer at the Department of Electronics, AGH University of Science and Technology in Cracow, Poland. I worked as a software engineer for a number of companies in USA, UK, Germany and Poland. For the recent years I have been conducting research in AI and teaching C++ at the AGH University. Currently I'm finishing the book entitled “Introduction to Programming with C++ for Engineers”.\n\n-------\nC++ on Sea is an annual c++ and coding conference, usually held in Folkestone, Kent in the UK. The 2020 & 2021 conferences were moved to virtual events due to social distancing requirements.\n\nProduced and Edited by Digital Medium Ltd: https://events.digital-medium.co.uk\nEnquiries: events@digital-medium.co.uk"
