description: "This talk was recorded at CukenFest London 2018\n\nhttp://cukenfest.cucumber.io/\n\nTraditional knowledge sharing is no longer\_an effective way to deliver great software. I have modified the mob programming concept to mob testing to improve the way teams communicate.\_\n\nThis innovative approach allows the whole team to share every piece of information early on. It tightens\_loopholes in the traditional approach\_and tackles the painful headaches of\_environment setup and config issues faced by a new arrival to the team. Think of mob testing as an evaluation process to build trust and understanding."
