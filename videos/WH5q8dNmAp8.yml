description: 'Is it fast yet? Performance is getting ever more important and using nginx is one of the easiest hacks to make your system faster. This talk takes a look at why and how nginx is so fast â€” it''s all about being event-driven. Additionally, we discuss where you can make use of nginx''s power, specifically for terminating SSL connections, providing a load balancer or proxy, and to run static websites as well as dynamic web-applications with PHP.'
