recordingDate: 1475785789
description: "Increasingly we developers are asked to build applications spanning not only multiple mobile platforms but sometimes even including the desktop.\n\nHow do we share code across this many platforms? How can we architect this to create maintainable and testable code?\n\nThis talk covers an introduction to sharing code across platforms, the MVVM pattern itself and how to apply it to cross platform development using Xamarin. We'll look at sharing not only our application services but the user interface across platforms with Xamarin.Forms.\n\nFinally we'll take it the next level and look at some more advanced patterns in view model composition and conductors."
