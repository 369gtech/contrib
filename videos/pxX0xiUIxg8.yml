title: 'Lambda Jam 2014 - Carlos Marin - From Object-Oriented to Functional programming'
recordingDate: 1410617025
description: 'At Rackspace data centers we manage over 50,000 networking devices, via multiple communication protocols, across numerous worldwide data centers and with rigorous SLAs. One of the ways we are able to handle this is task is using Erlang. We’ve developed an application, which exposes functionality through a RESTful API, enabling an abstracted interface to perform operations over a broad array of device models and multiple manufacturers. In this session, Carlos Marin, software developer at Rackspace, will present the good and the bad of beginning work with Erlang applications from a background in Object-Oriented programming (Java, C++, Python), moving into the Functional programming space. Carlos will explain how his team uses Erlang, and how they leverage its strengths, configuration and distribution. Attendees will walk away with an understanding of how to better venture into the Functional programming space while keeping an “Enterprise” perspective.'
