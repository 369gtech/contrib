title: 'O''Reilly Webcast: Thoughts on Google App Engine- a Python programmer''s perspective'
recordingDate: 1338939195
description: "Google recently promoted their App Engine technology from \"preview\" to a fully supported, released product, and last year App Engine survived the \"project cull\" that occurred at Google just after Larry Page stepped up to the plate as CEO.\n\nIn this O'Reilly webcast, Paul Barry discusses the current state of App Engine based on his experience teaching the technology both within an undergraduate and commercial setting.\n\nIf you are interested in learning a bit more about App Engine before diving in, sign up for this webcast for a jump-start on the decision making process. Learn what's possible with App Engine, as well as just how easy it is to get started.\n\nGet answers to those FAQs that frequently pop up, including:\n\n    Just how free is App Engine?\n    Can App Engine run my SQL?\n    Am I locked-in to Google from now until eternity if I develop with App Engine?\n\nIn fact, why not sign up for the webcast, and ask your own questions? When illustrating a point, Paul will use Python as the programming language. Don't let this worry you if your into Java or Go, as Paul will make a concerted effort to mention those technologies when it makes sense to.\n\nSo... what's stopping you? Click that \"register now\" button. (You know you want to).\nAbout Paul Barry\n\nPresenter: Paul Barry lectures at the Institute of Technology, Carlow in Ireland, where he specializes in open source scripting technologies, web/cloud development, and systems management. Paul is a Contributing Editor to Linux Journal magazine as well as a published author of technical books. His latest - part of the hugely popular O'Reilly Head First series - is Head First Python, which is designed to get non-Python programmers up-to-speed with Python in as short a time-frame as possible (not to mention including of a cracker of a chapter on Google App Engine). Paul has yet to miss an opportunity to present (sometimes more than once) at every single PyCon Ireland conference, and he recently delivered a one-day intensive introductory tutorial on App Engine to FlossUK. Like most of us, Paul spends far too much time in front of a computer screen. Occasionally, he actually gets some work done. ;-)\n\nProduced by: Yasmina Greco"
