description: "This Summer, the Service Fabric team was delighted to have 3 young college students join our team as \"Explorer\" Interns. Here, we meet Adriana Ixba, Larissa Chiu, and Yogesh Balaje Mahendran. They discuss how their Summer of Service Fabric went, what they built, what they learned, and if their individual explorations have led them to the developer or program manager path. Tune in. Meet some very sharp people who are many years away from gray hair. \n\nFrom the Service Fabric team to Adriana, Larissa, and Yogesh: We loved having you in the family this Summer and wish you the very best of luck in your bright futures!"
