title: 'Rust as a support language by Geoffroy Couprie'
language: English
recordingDate: 1478851764
description: "Up until now, the go-to language for low level, performance oriented code was C, or C++. Last year, Mozilla publicly released Rust, a language designed for safe memory manipulation, providing high level tools for low level development. It has since proven a good language to build the basic bricks of a system, and replace some C plugins for various language with safe and readable code. I will present in this talk various techniques I use to rewrite parts of a project in Rust, and the benefits you can get from applying it to your own projects.\n\nGeoffroy Couprie handles security and quality assurance at Clever Cloud, develops in Rust and researches on parser security at VideoLAN. He thinks a lot about cryptography, protocol design and data management.\n\n[TYS-8334]"
