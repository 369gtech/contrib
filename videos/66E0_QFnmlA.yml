title: 'Serg Hospodarets: CSS Houdini - from CSS variables to JavaScript and back'
recordingDate: 1498818891
description: "CSS Custom Properties are added to all the major browsers and provide the ability to use the CSS native variables power which is a huge step to the future of CSS.\nNow is time to do the next one- to have an ability to register the new native CSS Custom properties from JavaScript. They should work with the same performance as the native CSS properties, being animatable and being aligned CSSOM.\nCSS Houdini provides a specification for that, which is already available in some browsers and allows to register the new Custom Properties, set the valid values and many other things.\nThis will mostly solve the problem of polyfilling the new properties and open the way to animate CSS Custom Properties.\nAll this brings CSS to the next level and is one of the important steps to the bright future with CSS Houdini."
