description: "The Molecules, developer Media Molecule’s in-house “band” open with a set created entirely in Dreams. The Molecules started as a concept to show how Dreams could be used in unconventional ways, combining pre-made art and music elements (still made in Dreams) with music and animation performed live in the game’s creation tools with the DS4 controller. Showcasing genres from jpop to heavy metal, digital painting and puppeteering, the band highlights the performance capabilities of Dreams.\n\n -- Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/gdc"
