description: "Microsoft HoloLens is a fascinating device, bringing augmented reality (or, to be precise, Mixed Reality) to a whole new level. Untethered, this Windows 10 PC is worn on your head, has a battery life of a few hours, can run any Windows 10 Universal app, can add virtual objects to the \"real reality\" and more. Everyone has to start somewhere! And this is where Laurent Bugnion, a 2D programming veteran, but a 3D newbie, had to start too. In this session, we will understand what a HoloLens device is, how it works, see live demos, and then see how the 3D development environment is setup. We will use simple examples to understand how coding works in the 3D world and how you can interact with holograms :) This session will be rich in new information and in demos, so come prepared to experience a new reality.\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
