description: "Google Tech Talks\nMarch, 11 2008\n\nABSTRACT\n\nCreating digital content for virtual worlds remains a significant\nchallenge, especially for urban environments, which are among the\nlargest and most complex. As display capabilities improve and audience\nexpectations grow, procedural modeling techniques are becoming an\nincreasingly important supplement to traditional modeling software. In\nthis talk, we present grammar-based, image-based and interactive\nmethods for the efficient creation of urban environments. Thus massive\narchitectural models of high visual quality and geometric detail can\nbe produced at low cost. Selected examples demonstrate solutions to\npreviously unsolved modeling problems, especially to consistent mass\nmodeling with volumetric shapes of arbitrary orientation. Furthermore,\nwe show massive urban models with unprecedented level of detail, with\nthe virtual rebuilding of the archaeological site of Pompeii as a case\nin point.\n\nSpeaker: Peter Wonka\nPeter Wonka joined the computer science faculty of Arizona State\nUniversity as Assistent Professor in 2004 after two years as a\npost-doctorate researcher at the Georgia Institute of Technology. He\nreceived his Ph.D. in computer science from the Vienna University of\nTechnology in 2001 and a masters degree in urban planning in 2002. His\nresearch interests include various topics in computer graphics,\nespecially real-time rendering and procedural modeling. Peter Wonka is\na member of the PRISM lab (http://prism.asu.edu/).\n\nSpeaker: Pascal Mueller\nPascal Mueller is researcher at the Computer Vision Laboratory of the\nETH Zurich (http://www.vision.ethz.ch) and CEO of the recently founded\nspin-off company Procedural Inc. (http://www.procedural.com) located\nin Zurich, Switzerland. His main interests lie in the field of\ncomputer graphics: procedural modeling, generative design, visual\neffects production pipelines and computer-aided media art. He\ndeveloped the architectural modeling tool CityEngine and is\nco-developer of the multimedia engine Soundium. He has published\nvarious scientific papers including SIGGRAPH, and his body of artistic\nwork includes videos, short movies, over fifty live visuals\nperformances, and several interactive installations exhibited in\nmuseums like the Ars Electronica Center. Pascal Mueller received a\nmaster degree in computer science from ETH Zurich in 2001. For two\nyears, he worked as a 3D artist and technical director for the Swiss\nproduction company Central Pictures."
