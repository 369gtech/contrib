description: "In the early days of computing there were many good ideas that were 'before their time' and for one reason or another, these ideas were dropped!\n\nAs time passes, perhaps we should revisit some of these ideas.\n\nWhat were the good ideas that we have dropped?\n\nWhich ideas should be resurrected?\n\nWhat were the silly idea of the past and what can we learn from these?\n\nIn this talk, I'll visit ideas, old and new and see how they relate to the current needs of our community and our current work.\n\nI'll probably also rant on about Erlang and Elixir and how they can be used to solve some of the ideas that we have forgotten about.\n\nMore details on website here: https://codesync.global/speaker/joe-armstrong/"
