language: English
recordingDate: 1634029207
description: "Are you an experienced serverless developer who wants a handy guide to unleash the full power of serverless architectures for your production workloads? Do you have questions about whether to choose a stream or an API as your event source, or whether to have one function or many? In this talk, I will first discuss architectural best practices, optimizations, and handy little cheat codes to build secure, high-scale, high-performance serverless applications, using real customer scenarios to illustrate the benefits. But that's not it, speed and agility are essential to todayâ€™s businesses. The quicker you can get from an idea to first results, the more you can experiment and innovate with your data, perform ad-hoc analysis, and drive answers to new business questions. In this talk, I will also show how to efficiently build serverless applications, including the use of IoT, Streaming Data and AI services.\n#Serverless\n\nPresented by Adrian Hornsby\n\nSubscribe to our channel: https://youtube.pl/c/DevoxxPoland?sub_confirmation=1\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DevoxxPL\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/grzegorz.duda.official/\n\nJoin us also here:\nTechnology Radar Review: https://dworld.pl/radar\nDevelopers World Academy: https://dworld.pl/akademia\nDevflix: https://devflix.pl\n\n#Devoxx #DevoxxPoland #IT #Development #SoftwareDevelopment"
