description: "Why Your Manager LOVES Technical Debt and What to Do About It\n\nCaskey L. Dickson\n\nWe have all used \"Technical Debt\" to describe the horrors under the covers. Why doesn't management get the same sense of impending doom that we do? Because management thinks debt is good! Debt is an essential part of business and part of managing risk in business operations.\n\nTD is not a controlled thing with specific, manageable risks and rewards, it's a lurking monster waiting to bite us at the least opportune moment. In business-speak, what we actually have are \"naked call options.\" Future obligations that could arise at any time, without advance notice, and having unlimited downside. All leading to downtime, outages, and loss of business. I'll be describing what this financial instrument is and how to describe your backlog of essential but non-urgent work in a way that executives and management can understand.\n\nHelp your manager lose as much sleep over this as you do; and maybe get some room in your schedule to start addressing these issues--or at least stop making new ones. Oh, and free ponies for every attendee.\n\nView the full LISA15 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa15/conference-program"
