description: "In this 2017 GDC session, Havok's Ben Sunshine-Hill describes how to implement an asynchronous task processing system which can smooth CPU spikes, leverage idle cores, and guarantee an exact processing time limit for their AI step allowing programmers to still use complex and long-running AI computation in a real-time video game without compromising simulation quality.\n\nRegister for GDC: https://ubm.io/2yWXW38\n\nJoin the GDC mailing list: http://www.gdconf.com/subscribe\n\nFollow GDC on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Official_GDC \n\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
