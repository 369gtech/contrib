description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nHow Kubernetes Components Communicate Securely in Your Cluster - Maya Kaczorowski, Google  \n\nHow *do* your cluster components talk to each other?    In this expository talk, we'll first cover the main Kubernetes components that need trusted communication - that is, the API server, kubelet, and etcd, and how this communication is protected. Then, we'll go over how the cluster certificate authority (CA) works, and how this grants certificates to Kubernetes components. Furthermore, we'll explain what authentication, integrity, and encryption means, and what options are available in Kubernetes, and what you need to configure to address these pieces of CIS benchmarks. Lastly, we'll explain how you can protect other communications within your cluster, if needed for your workload - like node to node and pod to pod.    You'll come away with a better understanding of how communications in Kubernetes work, cluster trust, and default protections. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UaZE"
