title: '"Kerbal Space Program: A Journey into Mod Metadata Herding" - Leon Wright (LCA 2020)'
recordingDate: 1579158096
description: "Leon Wright\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/190/\n\nMid to late 2015, when sharing mod configurations Paul Fenwick and I were lamenting over the pain of hand managing mod updates, which for me meant rarely modding games. For Paul meant learning C#, designing and writing the Comprehensive Kerbal Addon Network for Kerbal Space Program mods.\r\n\r\nThe project has come a long way since the initial concept in late 2014 and the conversion from some hacked scripts into a full indexing service in late 2015. But technical debt and over triple the number of tracked mods began to really affect reliability, along with our ability to make changes. What once took our automated indexing service 20 minutes to complete a run, had slowly crept up into multi digit hours and required semi regular manual intervention.\r\n\r\nThis talk will cover a bit of a peak behind the curtains of a service used by over 100,000  non developers, nearly a 1000 unique mod authors and tracking the release cycles of  over 1000 individual mods.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
