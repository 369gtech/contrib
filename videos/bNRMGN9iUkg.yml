title: 'Practical DevSecOps Using Security Instrumentation'
language: English
recordingDate: 1601026396
description: "The traditional “outside in” scanning and firewalling approach to application security has failed. After decades of attempts to improve software security, vulnerability rates are still staggering while attacks are increasing in volume and severity. We need a new approach to security that doesn’t slow development or hamper innovation. In this talk, we’ll show how you can ensure software security from the “inside out” by leveraging the power of software instrumentation. Unlike scanning and firewalling, this approach establishes a safe and powerful way for development, security, and operations teams to collaborate. In this talk, we’ll show how software security instrumentation works, how it’s being used in many organizations, and what the future holds for DevSecOps.\n\nJeff Williams, CTO & Co-Founder at Contrast Security\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/practical-devsecops-using-security-instrumentation"
