description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Amsterdam 2019. #GOTOcon #GOTOams\nhttp://gotoams.nl\n\nRadu Weiss - Firecracker Expert\nArun Gupta - Principal Open Source Technologist at AWS and CNCF Board Member\n\nABSTRACT\nFirecracker is an open source virtualization technology that is purpose-built for creating and managing secure, multitenant containers and functions-based services. Firecracker runs in user space and uses the Linux Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) to create microVMs. The fast startup time and low memory overhead of each microVM enables you to pack thousands of microVMs onto the same machine.\nThis talk explains the foundation of Firecracker. It explains the minimal device model and how it interacts with Kubernetes, Docker and Kata containers. Attendees will learn about the decisions made that led to the performance, security and utilization improvements enabled by Firecracker. You'll also learn how Firecracker is used as the building block for AWS Lambda and AWS Fargate.\nFinally, attendees will see a live demo of firing up thousands of Firecracker microVMs [...]\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotoams.nl/2019/sessions/835/secure-and-fast-microvm-for-serverless-computing\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOamst\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\n#Firecracker #microVM #Serverless #KVM\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO Conference near you!
