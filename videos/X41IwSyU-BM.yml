description: "When using pattern based music composition software, especially the old genre of the Tracker I grew up with, the composition process is quite comparable to coding. So why not pushing this analogy to the max and actually program the music in JavaScript? In a browser? Live? That's exactly what I'm planning to do in this talk, using a little web app I wrote. I'll also talk briefly about other livecoding environments, how my (simple) approach works and if all goes well, by the end of the session, you'll all be shakin' yer asses to the beat.\n\nSource: http://2013.jsconf.eu/speakers/jan-krutisch-javascript-patterns-for-contemporary-dance-music.html\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
