description: 'Are you an experienced serverless developer who wants a handy guide to unleash the full power of serverless architectures for your production workloads? Do you have questions about whether to choose a stream or an API as your event source, or whether to have one function or many? In this talk, I will first discuss architectural best practices, optimizations, and handy little cheat codes to build secure, high-scale, high-performance serverless applications, using real customer scenarios to illustrate the benefits. But that''s not it, speed and agility are essential to today’s businesses. The quicker you can get from an idea to first results, the more you can experiment and innovate with your data, perform ad-hoc analysis, and drive answers to new business questions. In this talk, I will also show how to efficiently build serverless applications, including the use of IoT, Streaming Data and AI services.'
