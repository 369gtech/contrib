title: 'Faster and safer application deployments on Kubernetes with Shipa and Oracle Kubernetes Engine (OKE)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1610485482
description: "Slide Deck: http://bit.ly/okeshipa-slidedeck\n\nShipa’s application management framework, integrated into OKE, provides an out-of-the-box way for organizations to build, deploy and operate the full life-cycle of Kubernetes applications. With Shipa and OKE, organizations can make up for lost time and start getting value out of Kubernetes immediately.\n\nIn this webcast we will discuss and live demo how Shipa and OKE:\n- Provide developers an application-centric view they need so they never have to think about Kubernetes objects again.\n- Allow platform engineers to put up guardrails and centrally control deployments across multiple clusters, monitor application performance, and implement network policies and security configurations from a centralized dashboard.\n- Eliminate the need for custom Helm charts, Terraform scripts and YAML, reducing months of work that has to be done before pushing your first application into production.\n\nhttps://developer.oracle.com/"
