language: English
recordingDate: 1632325510
description: "\"Security continues to evolve, so you should too. In turn, Spring Security has not only enhanced its code base, but its team as well! \n \n Beginners are welcome! In this talk, we'll start with a simple, unsecured single-page application and progressively build it using simple HTTP basic authentication all the way to advanced use cases.\n \n Come see the latest and greatest from Spring Security. See the new Authorization Manager, the latest in OAuth, and more. On top of that, you can get to know a bit about our new team members.\"\n\nJosh Cummings, Software Engineer at VMware\n Marcus Da Coregio, Software Engineer at VMware\n Steve Riesenberg, Software Engineer at VMware\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/spring-security-55-from-taxi-to-takeoff"
