description: "I love the explicitness and structure of Elm. I donâ€™t love typing.\n\nA mechanical friend can help with both: smart templates modify code to perform common tasks, and Github PRs keep this safe and editor-independent.\n\nSee an Elm project created and grown with strategically placed automation."
