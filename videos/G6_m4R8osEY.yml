description: "Red Bull Racing Honda and Oracle bring data-driven insight to octane-powered races with machine learning\n\nOracle invites you to use its cloud platform, OCI, with race data in a no-stress, beginner-friendly environment. Use an open-source machine learning stack and different Oracle Cloud platforms (ARM, AMD, Intel, and GPU) to prototype predictive algorithms.\n\nOur objective is to bring fans and data scientists closer together by running analytics and machine learning models. These models are developed with data from past races and can be used in production or reused in videogame technology.\n\nIf you love high powered races and want to develop machine learning algorithms, come hang out with us and see how it works!"
