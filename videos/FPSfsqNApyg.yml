recordingDate: 1479335313
description: "“Are we there yet?” Continuous Improvement and Scaling DevOps at Urban Science\n\nMarc Priolo, Software Configuration Manager, Urban Science\n\n2 years ago at DOES14, I presented “Vision Versus Execution: Implementing Continuous Delivery”. I shared how we achieved a big Continuous Delivery win – increasing software test coverage and delivery velocity and efficiency.\n\nSince then, we have been busy scaling DevOps, Continuous Delivery and Lean principles across teams and practices throughout Urban Science. This rollout included both a cultural aspect, as well as an implementation of a centralized, shared, self-service automation solution for our teams – enabling them to “opt-in” to an automated pipeline.\n\nIn this talk I will present anecdotes and learnings gathered through our experience over the past two years and discuss the challenges and the value of scaling DevOps across the organization.\n\nDOES16 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
