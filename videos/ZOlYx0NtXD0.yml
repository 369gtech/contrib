recordingDate: 1539019381
description: "We are slowly getting used to see cars driven by artificial intelligence or surgeries performed by robots. But have you ever wondered when being in an art gallery if it is possible to recreate famous paintings? Can an algorithm repaint glorious Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci? Would her smile be as intriguing as in original? Algorithm based on natural evolution, that determines which species are strong enough to survive and develop and which are going to extinct, can recreate paintings without any artistic talents.\n\nDevConf 2018 (http://devconf.pl)\n26-28 September 2018"
