description: "Some machine learning proponents claim you only have to provide data to get value. However, reality is a bit more complex. On the way to active analytics for business, we have to answer two big questions: What must happen to data before running machine learning algorithms, and how should machine learning output be used to generate actual business value?\n\nJean-François Puget demonstrates the vital role of human context in answering those questions. You’ll discover why human context should be embraced as a guide to building better, smarter systems that people will use, trust, and love.\n\nThis keynote is sponsored by IBM.\n\nSubscribe to O'Reilly on YouTube: http://goo.gl/n3QSYi\n\nFollow O'Reilly on: \nTwitter: http://twitter.com/oreillymedia\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/OReilly\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/oreillymedia\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/8459/"
