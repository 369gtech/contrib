description: "Kurt Andersen, LinkedIn\n\nSite Reliability is a journey, not a destination...\n\nParticipants in the site reliability field come from varied backgrounds and companies with varying levels of implementation of SRE principles and practices. There are no hard boundaries on this journey, but using a phased model of skill acquisition, useful signposts along the way can be discovered to help the traveler.\n\nUsing a selection of exemplar values and practices for detailed examination and then extrapolating to a wider set of other practices, I'll explore some of the landmarks that can characterize the approaches used by SRE teams. This can help participants to evaluate where they and their company are operating along the spectrum of practice and can be helpful when looking toward and planning for the next turns in the journey.\n\nSome of the practice areas that I'll cover include incident prevention and handling, postmortems, KPI/SLOs, monitoring, and capacity management.\n\nView the full SREcon18 Asia/Australia Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon18asia/program\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
