description: "We work with technology every day. And every day it seems like there's more and more technology to understand: graphic design tools, build tools, frameworks and libraries, not to mention new HTML, CSS and JavaScript features landing in browsers. How should we best choose which technologies to invest our time in? When we decide to weigh up the technology choices that confront us, what are the best criteria for doing that?\n\nThis talk will help you evaluate tools and technologies in a way that best benefits the people who use the websites that we are designing and developing. Let's take a look at some of the hottest new web technologies and together we will dig beneath the hype to find out whether they will really change life on the web for the better.\n\nEVENT:\n\nSmashConf Barcelona 2017\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nJeremy Keith\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nSmashConf organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nSmashing Magazine: https://www.smashingmagazine.com/"
