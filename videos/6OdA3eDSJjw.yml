description: "Auto manufacturers are embedding more sensors and intelligent technology each year into vehicles, enabling them to detect, warn of, and actively avoid collisions. But how does one test for performance limits and effectiveness? This session describes a system of  soft  robot dummy vehicles programmed to induce collisions with these vehicles, whose driving functions are also automated for repeatability. Java permeates the implementation, including the low-level real-time embedded controls, autonomous self-navigation, robot coordination, and the HMIs for robot and automated vehicle test configurations and monitoring. The session describes the system, provides many code examples, and includes video showing the system in action.\n\n\nAuthor:\nPaul Perrone\nPaul Perrone is a roboticist, author, public speaker, and entrepreneur. He is founder and CEO of Perrone Robotics and inventor of the Java-based MAX robotics and automation software platform. He’s led Perrone Robotics from humble startup to a thriving enterprise in the automated and driverless vehicle technology space. His work has included leading a team in two DARPA Grand Challenge events, work with rocker Neil Young to automate his 1959 Lincoln Continental  LincVolt , help in planning an Autonomous Auto X Prize, chairing an SAE Committee for Automated Vehicle Standards, and fielding an advanced robotic test system for the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. He’s spent 20+ years relentlessly working to popularize robotics.\nView more trainings by Paul Perrone at https://www.parleys.com/author/paul-perrone-1\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
