recordingDate: 1359411781
description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2012.\nSpeaker: Kelly Tisdell\nBroadleaf Commerce is a feature rich, highly customizable, open source eCommerce framework built on top of The Spring Framework. Spring provides a huge number of container services such as dependency injection, AOP, transaction management, MVC, JPA support, security, etc. Broadleaf leveraged Spring's features to provide a highly functional and extensible eCommerce framework. Where Spring is a technical development framework, Broadleaf is an eCommerce domain-specific development framework. Broadleaf Commerce has extended Spring with a unique application context merge process to allow implementors to extend, override, and control every component of the Broadleaf Framework. Kelly will provide an overview of the Broadleaf features, along with a deeper dive into some of the more advanced technical capabilities of Broadleaf Commerce and how they are made possible by Broadleaf's use and extension of The Spring Framework."
