description: "Java SE 8 brings a variety of improvements to the  metadata  features of the Java language and libraries. Many of the restrictions on annotations have been lifted, and the ability to obtain parameter names by reflection has been added. This session describes these features and discusses some factors that influenced their design. It also explains and demonstrates how custom type checkers can use annotations to improve code quality.\n\n\nAuthors:\nAlexander Buckley\nAlex Buckley is the Specification Lead for the Java Language and the Java Virtual Machine at Oracle.
