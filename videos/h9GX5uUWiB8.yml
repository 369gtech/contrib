description: "Recording brought to you by American Express. https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs\nA few sneaky questions about Kotlin/Native were in search of an answer, crying in the void.\n\nThis is their story.\n• macOS UI app – seeing how all the Kotlin/Native/Multiplatform samples targeting Apple devices are either command-line or iOS apps, can a \"real\" user-facing macOS app (Cocoa) even be written with in Kotlin?\n• Swift/Objective-C – is there a limit to what can be written in Kotlin, especially considering platform-specific and setup/\"glue\" code?\n• Interface Builder – how much of the UI can be defined programmatically, in Kotlin?\n• app/build configuration – can the insane maze of project settings hidden deep inside Xcode be avoided, and perhaps be defined directly inside a 'build.gradle.kts'?\n• #Xcode – is it possible to develop/build without using Xcode and creating an Xcode project?\n• boredom – could all of the above (and more) be used to hack a Nintendo Switch™ Joy-Con™ controller via Bluetooth, turning it into the ultimate presentation remote, to be used in this very talk?\n\nResources:\nKotlinConf website: https://jb.gg/fyaze5\nKotlinConf on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlinconf\n\nKotlin website: https://jb.gg/pxrsn6\nKotlin blog: https://jb.gg/7uc7ow\nKotlin on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlin\n\n#KotlinConf19 #Kotlin #JetBrains\n\nAbout the Presenter:\nDeveloper Advocate @ JetBrains\n\nEugenio is a passionate developer who takes every “it can’t be done” as a personal challenge – and is not afraid to find creative solutions while doing so.\n\nHe's been stuck in a love/hate relationship with the green droid since 2011, culminating in him moving to Berlin in 2014 to join Clue as Lead Android Engineer.\n\nLately, he's been allegedly reported to do be abusing the Kotlin language, when he’s not too busy preaching about how Flutter is \"the solution to every problem in life\"."
