description: 'The internet offers an endless amount of simple online games like solitaire, minesweeper and hearts. However, these games are usually done with terrible UI/UX, lame graphics, full of banners and ads, and (dare I say it), built on FLASH. In this presentation I will talk about how I built a DOOM minesweeper game with React, Redux & Typescript. I will also share my dream is to create one open sourced website, which will host many well-created simple games, to serve both as a learning platform for developers and for players to enjoy playing good looking games with a great UI/UX, without ads.'
