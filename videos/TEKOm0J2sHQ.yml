language: English
recordingDate: 1540249664
description: "Just like the Windows platform, graphic drivers of macOS kernel are complicated and provide a large promising attack surface for EoPs and sandbox escapes from low-privileged processes. After auditing part of the binaries, I discovered a number of vulnerabilities last year. Including, NULL pointer dereference, stack-based buffer overflow, arbitrary kernel memory read and write, use-after-free, etc. Some of these vulnerabilities were reported to Apple Inc., such as the CVE-2017-7155, CVE-2017-7163, CVE-2017-13883.\n\nIn this presentation, I will share with you the detailed information about these vulnerabilities. Furthermore, from the attacker's perspective, I will also reveal some new exploit techniques and zero-days."
