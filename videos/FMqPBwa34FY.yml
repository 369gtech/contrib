title: 'YOW! West 2017 Melinda Seckington - Reflect & Refactor'
recordingDate: 1497226825
description: "As developers, we’re constantly learning: whether it’s figuring out how to solve new problems and bugs, or focusing on new skills and knowledge to apply to our work. Often when we talk about reflecting and refactoring, it will be about the way we work in our teams or how we can make our code better – but why don’t we apply the same method to ourselves?\n\nThis talk looks at how to constantly reflect and refactor your own skills and values, creating your own idea of a “good” developer. It will examine the psychology of creating new habits, the different motivations of why we are developers, and how we can each define the type of developers we want to be.\n\nMelinda Seckington is a developer at FutureLearn, a social learning platform, and leads the team’s employee evangelism. She loves attending BarCamps, Hackdays and other tech meet ups, and since 2009 has been organising them at Geeks of London. She also writes at MissGeeky, a blog about all things geeky and girly. When she’s not busy with events or blogging, you can find Melinda curled up on her couch with a good book or video game.\n\nFor more on YOW! West, visit http://west.yowconference.com.au"
