description: "The modularization of the Java SE platform in JDK 9 will bring many benefits but also many changes. Existing code that uses only official Java SE Platform APIs and supported JDK-specific APIs should continue to work without change. Code that uses certain deprecated features or any JDK-internal APIs is likely to break, however. This session shows you how to prepare existing libraries and applications for JDK 9 and how to get old code working on JDK 9 even when you can’t update it.\n\nSpeaker:\nAlan Bateman, Consulting Member of Staff, Oracle"
