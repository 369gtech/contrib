recordingDate: 1380435844
description: "Clojure is a new dynamic language targeting the Java Virtual Machine, the .NET Common Language Runtime, and JavaScript. Clojure builds on the long history of Lisp-based languages while embracing modern platforms and pragmatic design. This talk is an introduction to Clojure and its core concepts: immutable values, code as data, software transactional memory, generic data access, and polymorphism without classes.\n\nStuart SierraStuart Sierra has been involved in Clojure/core since (almost) the very beginning and is the author of many open-source Clojure ilbraries. He helped found the Program on Law & Technology at Columbia Law School, where he built AltLaw.org, the first real-world Clojure web applications and open-source search engine for legal references. He is the co-author, with Luke VanderHart, of the book ClojureScript: Up and Running and Practical Clojure.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
