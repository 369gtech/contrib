description: "Kubernetes and The GitOps Face-Off - Ricardo Aravena & Javeria Khan, Branch Metrics \n\nDuring the last year, we have seen how Kubernetes GitOps has made organizations rethink CI/CD from storing all declarative aspects in git, reducing the use of manual kubectl commands and managing deployments using PRs.   In this talk, we will review some of the more popular GitOps open source tools such as Flux, Gitkube, Draft, and Skaffold, and how they work in real-world production environments. We'll give the side by side comparisons. Which one is better for the GCP, Azure or AWS? How do you integrate them with container building tools such as Kaniko, img, etc? Which ones are easier for developers to use in local environments?  By the end of the session, the audience will have a good understanding of the pros and cons of each these tools and how leverage templates such as the Kubernetes operator pattern to quickly deploy them in production ready environments. \n\nTo Learn More: https://sched.co/GrSe"
