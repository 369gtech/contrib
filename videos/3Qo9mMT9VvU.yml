description: "When we code, we value efficiency. We try to reuse the code, keep it concise, and be as clear as possible so our teammates have little trouble understanding it.\n\nBut as the system grows and new teammates join, our codes begin to evolve in a different way than intended. The same UI components end up having different functions, or the same functions end up having different UIs, or we end up with redundant implementations of UI components and functions.\n\nIn this talk, I will share my experience of unifying such fragmented UI/UX components by building a design system for Kakao Integrated Search."
