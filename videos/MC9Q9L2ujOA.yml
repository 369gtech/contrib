title: 'Ben Newman: Yield Ahead: Regenerator in Depth [JSConf2014]'
recordingDate: 1405607361
description: 'The future of JavaScript is too exciting to put on hold while native implementations get around to supporting much-needed new features like classes, generator functions, and modules. This talk dives into the concepts and techniques involved in transforming these futuristic syntaxes into JavaScript-of-today, through the lens of Facebook''s Regenerator project, which efficiently simulates ES6 generator functions (and soon async functions too!) using plain ES5. Listeners will come away from this talk with a deep understanding of Regenerator''s implementation, and also (hopefully!) a headful of ideas for designing transformations of their own.'
