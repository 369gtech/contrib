title: 'Manojit Nandi - Measures and Mismeasures of algorithmic fairness - PyCon 2019'
recordingDate: 1557111000
description: "\"Speaker: Manojit Nandi\n\nWithin the last few years, researchers have come to understand that machine learning systems may display discriminatory behavior with regards to certain protected characteristics, such as gender or race. To combat these harmful behaviors, we have created multiple definitions of fairness to enable equity in machine learning algorithms. In this talk, I will cover these different definitions of algorithmic fairness and discuss both the strengths and limitations of these formalizations.  In addition, I will cover other best practices to better mitigate the  unintended bias of data products.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2019 and https://github.com/PyCon/2019-slides\""
