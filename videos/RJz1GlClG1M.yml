description: "How can we apply technology to drive business value? For years, we've been told that the performance of software delivery teams doesn't matter―that it can't provide a competitive advantage to our companies. Through six years of groundbreaking research, the DORA team set out to find a way to measure software delivery performance―and what drives it―using rigorous statistical methods. This talk presents the findings of that research, including how to measure the performance of software teams, what capabilities organizations should invest in to drive higher performance, and how software leaders can apply these findings in their own organizations.\n\nEVENT:\n\nØredev 2019\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nJez Humble\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\n\nØredev Conference Organizers provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish Øredev conference talks.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nØredev YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0XtR2kcXnqtfrGSsxM8oAg"
