description: 'In this session, we discuss feedback on the Google Drive SDK documentation. We announce a new in-page feedback mechanism as well as other feedback channels like the Drive SDK Stack Overflow channel and blog comments.  We clarify that there is no longer an installation requirement for apps that want access to the Drive API.  Also, we demonstrate some of the marketing and distribution features included in a full Chrome Web Store integration, including up-selling from filtered lists of Drive apps that can open specific file types (MIME type filtering).  To close, we highlight one of the tips in a recent post to the Google Apps Developer blog at http://googleappsdeveloper.blogspot.com/.'
