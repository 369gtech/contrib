description: "Scaling Birchbox: Lessons Learned\n\nIn 2011 I joined Birchbox, a startup with a few thousand customers, no technology team, and a small office stacked high with beauty products. Over the ensuing years we scaled the business to more than a million active subscribers, serving 6 countries, out of 4 offices. In this talk I’ll discuss some of the lessons I learned building the engineering, product and data teams, and scaling the technology.\n\nEngineering, product, and data science leader with a background in artificial intelligence and entrepreneurship. Experienced in building and scaling teams, customer experiences, and software. \nPassionate about creating innovative products that people love, delivering measurable results, and building teams that take pride and joy in their work. \n\nCurrently based in Sydney and available for short and long-term consulting engagements locally and internationally.\n\nFor more on YOW!
