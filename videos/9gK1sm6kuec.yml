title: 'Fireside Chat #23: To estimate, or not to estimate, that is the question'
language: English
recordingDate: 1639049402
description: "In this episode, Codurance co-founders Sandro Mancuso and Mashooq Badar and Spain's Managing Director José E. Rodríguez Huerta discuss if teams should or should not estimate and the challenges of doing it. What do we need estimates for? At what level? How do we deal with uncertainties? Are there alternatives? This is another very thought-provoking fireside chat.  \n\nIf you would like us to discuss a topic, please let us know in the comments and we will do our best to address it in a future episode. Any topics around Agile, Software Craftsmanship, Extreme Programming, technical practices, thought leadership, architecture, management, team dynamics, or anything related to technology or software projects are welcome. \n\nThe idea of the Fireside chat series is to record informal conversations we normally have outside working hours. Topics are normally decided just before we start recording. Our objective is to have spontaneous conversations instead of something more structured or scripted. \n\nFor more information about Codurance, please visit our website: https://codurance.com/."
