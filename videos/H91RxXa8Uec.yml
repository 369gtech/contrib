recordingDate: 1543840594
description: "Build your own Redux: Why State Management Frameworks Aren't Always the Immediate Answer.\n\nNowadays, it might be difficult for us to think about a large-scale React application that does not utilize a state management framework, such as Redux or MobX. But do we always need them?\nIn the course of the talk, we'll go over what makes them so popular, what are the problems that they really solve, and see how we can come up with solutions by fashioning our own versions of \"Redux\" that solve exactly what our own apps need solving."
