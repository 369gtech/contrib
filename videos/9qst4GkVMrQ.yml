description: "This video was recorded at ElixirConf EU Virtual 2020 - https://www.elixirconf.eu/archives/virtual_x_2020/index.html\n\nMore great virtual tech conferences - https://codesync.global \n\n---\n\nLivecoding a WebAssembly interpreter\nby\nTonći Galić\n\nABSTRACT\nOne of the exciting announcements this year was Lumen, an alternative BEAM implementation designed for WebAssembly. But what actually is WebAssembly and why has it received so much news lately? It is afterall, a recommendation (besides HTML, CSS and JS) by the WWW Consortium and 4th language to run natively in the browser. In this talk, we'll zoom into the details and demystify some of it's magic by building a WASM interpreter in Elixir.\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - Tonći Galić\n\nTonći is a polyglot web developer with a broad range of interests and also a broad range of experiences. He started out with Perl/CGI around 1999, but worked with various languages/tools throughout the years. In the last few years, he has focused on Elixir as he is in love with the language. Since his new love, he enjoys discovering functional aspects of programming languages. He is the organiser of the Amsterdam Elixir meetup, Elixir Bootcamp and is a co-organiser of Code BEAM lite Amsterdam.\n\n---\n\nElixirConf EU\nWebsite: https://www.elixirconf.eu/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ElixirConfEU"
