description: "Are you still using Docker in production? Get over it! Serverless is the NEW future of the Cloud. But since the Cloud is still someone else's computer, that needs to be managed too. And if it is sitting idle, you probably have to pay for it whether you like it or not. No server can be more easily managed than no server. Therefore: meet Serverless, a new paradigm that truly approaches the Pay-as-You-Go philosophy once promised by the Cloud.\n\nThis session explores Serverless, its impact on existing architectures, and assesses it's usability for Mobile Back-ends as a Service (MBaaS), Functions-as-a-Service (FaaS) and also for Microservices based architectures hosted in the cloud. Live coding and demos will be based on Amazon Web Services and Apache OpenWhisk offerings.\n\nBert Ertman is a Fellow at Luminis in the Netherlands. Besides his day job he served as the Java User Group leader for NLJUG (~4500 members) for the past decade. A frequent speaker on Java and Software Architecture related topics all over the world, as well as a book author (Building Modular Cloud Applications with OSGi, Oâ€™Reilly 2013) and a serial conference organizer.\n\nIn 2008, Bert was honored by being awarded the coveted title of Java Champion by an international panel of Java leaders and luminaries. Bert is a JavaOne Rock Star Speaker and a Duke's Choice Award (2013/2017) winner."
