description: "A lightning talk exploring the thought that Developers as the last bastion of Defence on what decisions are made to change our world. As tech will shape all our futures, the decisions developers make to implement or not implement features are becoming increasingly important. Their opinions and voices matter, as they are the engineers of the next generation's environment. The next generation may not know any differently as they grow in that environment and we, the developers today have to make those decisions which span philosophical and ethical boundaries. Do you write the code that may potentially take advantage of the vulnerable, or do you stand up for what you believe is right. An individual developer may not feel that she has the power to push back, but allied with many developers, their beliefs can sway company strategy and make vital decisions for how we all live our lives in the future.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
