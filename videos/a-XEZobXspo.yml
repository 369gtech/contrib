You'll learn how to understand what the JIT compiler is doing with your code, how to collect the necessary debug information for further profiling, what are the limitations of GraalVM's native images and how to overcome most frequent of them.\n\nWe'll look at the polyglot applications and how they impact the code you're writing, learn the polyglot API you need to use to effectively mix different programming languages in one program. We'll explore using the common tooling like VisualVM and Chrome debugger for languages supported by GraalVM, even when you're running JavaScript as stored procedures in the database.\n\nThe session is based on a series of demos you can follow along and try yourself later, and the insight you can directly use.\n\nOleg Šelajev \nFrom Oracle\nOleg Šelajev is a developer advocate for the GraalVM project at Oracle Labs, which aims to make programs run faster and developers more productive. He helps to organize VirtualJUG, the online Java User Group, and a GDG chapter in Tartu, Estonia. Became a Java Champion in 2017. Loves pizza and playing chess. Favorite languages: Java, JavaScript, and Python. And Clojure. And Kotlin, and TypeScript. In general, Oleg loves all languages, compilers, and virtual machines.\n\nThomas Wuerthinger \nFrom Oracle Labs\nThomas Wuerthinger is a Senior Research Director at Oracle Labs leading programming language implementation teams for languages including Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and R. He is the architect of the GraalVM polyglot runtime. Previously, he worked on the V8 JavaScript engine at Google, and the Maxine research virtual machine at Sun Microsystems. He received a PhD degree from JKU Linz for his research about dynamic code evolution."
