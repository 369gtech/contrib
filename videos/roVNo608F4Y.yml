title: 'DrupalCon Vienna 2017: Doctor, Will My Drupal 7 Commerce Site Survive the Upgrade?'
recordingDate: 1506591206
description: "Commerce 2.x (the Drupal 8 version) has come a long way since last year. It's ready for production.\n\nThis wasn't the case when I migrated my Drupal 6 Ubercart site to Drupal 7...so I'm curious now, especially since upgrading from Drupal 8 to Drupal 9 will be much easier.\n\nI wonder:\n\nHow hard is it to go from Commerce 1.x to Commerce 2.x?\nHow far along has Commerce Migrate come?\nWhat is included in Commerce itself now?\nHow do I port my custom functionality (and do I need to)?\nI'm going to explore these questions and share my experiences.\n\nTo benefit the most from this session, you should have some development experience. Previous e-commerce and Migrate experience is a plus. A working understand of Drupal 8 and OOP concepts will also help.\n\nYou'll hopefully learn how to avoid making counterproductive architecture decisions while building your Commerce 2.x store and get a head start in understanding the concepts."
