title: 'Upload Files to Object Storage from Oracle Application Express (APEX)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1625839178
description: 'It is easier to store the files uploaded through APEX within Binary large object (BLOB) in the Oracle Database. However, it increases the size of the database and considerably affecting the time to retrieve the data. On the other hand, Object Storage will enable the users to store an unlimited amount of unstructured data.  The video demonstrates how easy it is to authenticate and interact with the Oracle Cloud Object Storage Service REST APIs to upload the files via APEX. This application will utilize the web credentials for authentication, REST data sources to list the buckets and their contents, store files temporarily in APEX_APPLICATION_TEMP_FILES and uses APEX_WEB_SERVICE to call the REST API to upload files to the Object Storage.'
