title: 'Codenarc Revisited'
recordingDate: 1475046001
description: 'When was the last time you looked at code quality? Do you have some old codenarc configuration with half(or more!) of the rules turned off because they were reporting false positives? Or maybe you have @SupressWarnings all over your code? Or perhaps you want to do something small like to enforce tabs vs spaces for all members of your team?Codenarc is a static analysis tool for Groovy that enforces style, detects bad practices, and suggests improvements. If it has been awhile since you last looked at codenarc, there might be new rules or configuration options to get you back on the path to better code quality. This session will explore what is new with codenarc, options for specific groovy ecosystem projects such as grails, and walk through how to create custom rules for your own project.'
