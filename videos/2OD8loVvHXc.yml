description: "\"Geospatial Analysis using Python and JupyterHub\n[EuroPython 2019 - Talk - 2019-07-10 - Singapore [PyData track]\n[Basel, CH]\n\nBy Martin Christen\n\nGeospatial data is data containing a spatial component â€“ describing objects with a reference to the planet's surface. This data usually consists of a spatial component, of various attributes, and sometimes of a time reference (where, what, and when). Efficient processing and visualization of small to large-scale spatial data is a challenging task. \n\nThis talk describes how to process and visualize geospatial vector and raster data using Python and the Jupyter Notebook. \n\nTo process the data a high performance computer with 4 GPUS (NVidia Tesla V100), 192 GB RAM, 44 CPU Cores is used to run JupyterHub.\n\nThere are numerous modules available which help using geospatial data in using low- and high-level interfaces, which are shown in this presentation. In addition, it is shown how to use deep learning for raster analysis using the high performance GPUs and several deep learning frameworks.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2019.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/"
