description: 'Intel Deep Learning SDK enables using of optimized open source deep-learning frameworks, including Caffe and TensorFlow through a step-by-step wizard or iPython interactive notebooks. It includes easy and fast installation of all depended libraries and advanced tools for easy data pre-processing and model training, optimization and deployment, providing an end-to-end solution to the problem. In addition, it supports scale-out on multiple computers for training, as well as using compression methods for deployment of the models on various platforms, addressing memory and speed constraints.'
