description: "Want to learn the basic skills to stop talking about data science and start doing data science? After attending this mini-workshop, you'll be able to run your own data science experiments with Twitter's API and IPython Notebook! Besides learning the fundamentals of how to use IPython Notebook, you'll learn how to do the following kinds of things with Twitter's easy-to-use API:\n\n    Authenticate to Twitter's API\n    Explore the trending topics\n    Search for tweets\n    Filter tweets from the firehose\n    Calculate who is following whom\n    Compute similarity amongst Twitter users\n\nTwitter is an excellent playground for data science experiments, but the most of the concepts you'll learn generalize to other social websites like Facebook, LinkedIn, and Google+.\n\nThis webcast is code-intensive, hands-on, and features lots of live examples; attendees should ideally have some minimal programming experience (or apsire to know more about the art of what's possible) to get the most out of it.\n\nAbout Matthew Russell\n\nMatthew Russell (@ptwobrussell) is Chief Technology Officer at Digital Reasoning, Principal at Zaffra, and author of several books on technology including Mining the Social Web (O'Reilly, 2013), now in its second edition.
