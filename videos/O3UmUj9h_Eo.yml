description: "\"Speaker: Victor Stinner\n\nThe CPython project is now 28 years old. It has active core developers, but almost all of them are volunteers. It's difficult to ask someone to be committed into a project for 5 years without being paid. Helping newcomers and mentoring contributors takes time and few developers are available for that. We are working on improving the diversity of CPython core developers and get more active core developers, but it's a slow process.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2019 and https://github.com/PyCon/2019-slides\""
