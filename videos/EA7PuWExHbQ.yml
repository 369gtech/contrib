description: "Google Tech Talk\r\nJanuary 20, 2010\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nPresented by Connie Kwan and Matt Hockenberry.\r\n\r\nDo you know how many countries your shaver has been to before it found you?  How about the origin of your dinner last night?  And do you want to know the environmental impact of a trip to Russia?   At SourceMap.org, we want to help you find out.  We think it is important that you can access food and product origin information at your fingertips.  We also think people should be able to calculate a journey's impact on our planet.  With SourceMap.org, you can now find out where all your laptop components come from, and the environmental impact of all those components.  You can decide whether tomato soup or chicken fried steak is healthier for your watershed, your land and your community."
