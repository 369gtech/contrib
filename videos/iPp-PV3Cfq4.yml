description: "Digital fabrication equipment is increasingly cheap and cheerful - it's easy to use and easy to own. CNC mills, laser cutters, waterjets - they are just more tools in the toolbox that happen to make custom jobs and one-offs more accessible with their computer-controls. But, unlike the evocative name '3D printer' suggests, they do not enable full control of physical matter. There is no Star-Trek-esque replicator that can automatically build the physical counterpart of an arbitrary digital design (and we're a ways from getting one).\n\nFor more information on the Solid Conference, visit http://solidcon.com.\n\nThe Machines that Make project is working on extending their digital fabrication toolbox with equipment that allows them to prototype beyond the confines of the tools they currently have. Why can't we hook smart subsytems into our lasercutters, or modulate the layer thickness in our extrusion based 3D printers? To provide richer access to tools, the project is building modular and open systems of kinematics, sensors/actuators, motion control, virtual machine network interfaces, and CAD/CAM software that can be outfitted with any toolhead. Using these machine-subsystems as building blocks, they can rapidly prototype rapid prototyping machines - for milling/3d printing/scoring/pipetting/writing/coiling/anything. Instead of hacking together existing tools (e.g. attaching a fibreglass-spooling head onto a 3-axis milling machine that you write a weaving toolpath for using rhinocam), they want to elegantly, quickly, and painlessly make machines that make (e.g. outfitting a parametric 3-axis motion stage with a spooling head and writing a software widget to have the stage weave). This talk outlines some of the technical solutions the project has built to incorporate the software practices of modularity and reusability into digital fabrication tool design, and how these solutions are making it easier for non-experts to build their own computer-controlled tools.\n\nSome examples of demonstration tools built so far include tabletop milling machines, 3d printers, scoring machines, and pipetting robots.
