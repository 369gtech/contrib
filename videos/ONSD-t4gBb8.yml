description: 'Accessibility standards are often first on the chopping block in the face of deadlines. We''ve all been on projects where we write that dreaded TODO comment leaving an accessibility audit for later. Let''s unpack why that is and start changing it!

In this talk we''ll discuss how to get started with accessibilityâ€”the metaphorical salad and power walking of a11y that can prepare us to run an accessibility marathon, if you will.'
