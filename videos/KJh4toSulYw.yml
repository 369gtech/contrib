description: "MobDevCon Lite 9th July 2014.\n\niOS toolbox: must know technologies for iOS development. \nMatteo Manferdini\n(@MatManferdini)\n\n\nMatteo is a software and business consultant specialized in iOS and Mac OS X. He has developed and published several apps, alone and for different clients, and has been a co-founder of New Lemurs, where he was the main developer on the first product. He runs a consultancy named Pure Creek, based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. He has been one of the founders of Appsterdam, where he was the Speakers Bureau coordinator for almost three years, organizing the weekly lectures and giving speaker training. He's also a teacher and trainer in programming and iOS, he's spoken at different conferences and he's currently writing a book on learning iOS by example. \n\nAs the iOS platform has evolved over the years, Apple has introduced many useful technologies to help developers ship quality apps. While some technologies are useful only in specific cases, many new and old ones should be in the toolbox of any iOS developer as they are required for the development of most apps. In this talk we will have a look at the functioning of many of them and to the general design patterns for iOS development.\n\nhttp://www.meetup.com/Norfolk-Developers-NorDev/events/191805352/"
