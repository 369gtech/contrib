description: "Ken Kousen\nPresident\nKousen IT, Inc.\n\nEven after twenty years, Java is still going strong. The language has evolved from a small, simplified innovation in the C++ family to the enterprise juggernaut we know today. The growth of Java has encompassed all sorts of features, some of which wound up being used for purposes other than intended. This hopefully entertaining talk will highlight some of the major changes in Java over the years, from JavaBeans and introspection to EJBs to generics to streams, lambdas, and modularization, and will include a glimpse at some of the expected changes in Java 10 and 11. To coin a phrase, developers who forget the past are doomed to refactor it. This guided tour may bring back fond memories of the twists and turns in Java over the years, with an eye toward the future."
