description: "Quantitative Engineer? Business Intelligence Analyst? Data Scientist? The data deluge has come upon us so quickly that we don't even know what to call ourselves, much less how to make a career of working with data. This talk examines the critical traits that lead to success by looking back to what may be the first act of data science.\n\nJohn Rauser\n\nAmazon\n\nJohn has been extracting value from large datasets for over 15 years at companies ranging from hedge funds to small data-driven startups to amazon.com. He has deep experience in machine learning, data visualization, website performance and real-time fault analysis. An empiricist at heart, John's optimism and can-do attitude make \"Just do the experiment!\" his favorite call to arms."
