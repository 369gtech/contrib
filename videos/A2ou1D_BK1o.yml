description: "This presentation is an overview of the Android Developer Tools (ADT), including many useful techniques, tips and tricks for getting the most out of them.\n\nAs with any set of tools, they are only useful if you are able to identify the right tool for the right job, and know how to find it when you need it. This presentation is designed help every Android craftsman (from beginner to expert) learn how to use the basic toolkit to create the best products possible, with the least amount of effort.\n\nI will walk through an Android project that contains a series of pre-configured examples that highlight the capabilities of theADT.
