description: 'The author of Bitcoin which introduced the blockchain is still anonymous - the blockchain was indeed born in darkness. But as the popularity of various cryptocurrencies and of the blockchain technology in general soars - does the blockchain grow towards the light? During this lecture we will consider what a blockchain really is, how it grows, and related issues such as anonymity & transaction speed. We will try to analyze the trends to predict the future and determine whether the blockchain can reach enlightenment.'
