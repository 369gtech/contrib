description: "“There is more than one way to burn a book. And the world is full of people running about with lit matches.” – Ray Bradbury, Fahrenheit 451\n\nWhat led to this session?\n\nA team has published a snapshot of tr.wikipedia.org, the Turkish version of Wikipedia on IPFS.\n\nWhy did that happen? Wikipedia went dark for everyone in Turkey. According to the independent watchdog group Turkey Blocks, the Turkish government had issued a court order that permanently restricts access to the online encyclopedia.\n\nWhy should the web move to IPFS?\n\nShort answer, improving humanity’s access to information without the need of governmental agencies controlling that information.\n\nHow does IPFS works?\n\nThis section of session discusses how IPFS changes the addressing of information, moving from location addressing to content addressing.\n\nIPFS is harder to attack and easier to distribute because it’s peer-to-peer and decentralized.\n\n\n\nThe session will also discuss the various aspects of IPFS like,\n\n1. The content downloaded is cryptographically verified\n\n2. If one IPFS gateway gets blocked, you can use another one.\n\n\n\nand more.\n\nSo where does the challenge lie?\n\nWhen there is content, our beloved Drupal needs to be part of it and deliver same editorial experience we enjoy, yet utilising the immutable nature of content on IPFS.\n\nWhat is the Blueprint we are talking about?\n\n\n\nWe created a blueprint and the development is in progress. It needs more attention and more love from our Drupal community to make it a feasible and useful CMS to easily harness the power of IPFS in specific use cases.\n\n\nThe key idea of session will be brainstorming and collaboration on ideas to how to make it robust to make it top choice CMS for such use cases.\n\nPS: Can we invite Julian Assange for this? He might just love it"
