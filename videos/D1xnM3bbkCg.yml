description: "Google Tech Talk\r\nMay 7, 2009\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nPresented by Martin Hellman\r\n\r\nNuclear weapons are the elephant in the room that almost no one talks about. This presentation therefore approaches the subject from the much less threatening -- actually downright attractive -- perspective of soaring. Risk analysis is the glue that ties the two subjects together, while my experience in developing public key cryptography provides an important lesson on the positive side.\r\n\r\nRelated links: http://nuclearrisk.org/soaring_article.php is an article that is closely related to the talk. Another link of interest is http://nuclearrisk.org/paper.pdf.\r\n\r\nMartin Hellman is Professor Emeritus at Stanford University and co-inventor of public key cryptography."
