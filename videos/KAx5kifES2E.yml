description: "Building decoupled software is essential when you want to maintain velocity while developing a product in a global, distributed way. However, following the wrong parameters will handicap your quality assurance. How to be sure your product works? I’m a staunch advocate of using unit tests. They are faster and less flaky than integrated tests and allow you to scale up like a startup. Don’t be fooled! Integrated tests will kill your product. Among other things I will introduce the concept of contract testing and show you examples of PACT, the most suitable Java library to implement this concept. \n\nAbout:\nJosé San Román Álvarez de Lara, CIO, ING Bank España\n\nJosé is the Chief Information Officer (CIO) of ING Bank in Spain, responsible for developing the local IT strategy and aligning it with ING’s global ambition to build the digital bank of the future.
