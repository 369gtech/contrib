First, I will show you why and when HTML is a good choice as a media type for your API. A hypermedia API should expose use cases. If these are specific enough (and if you choose HTML as the media type), you are close to the \"mobile first\" web strategy. And, correspondingly, mobile first\" is close to the idea of HTML hypermedia APIs - your API can be your web site and vice versa!\n\nBut the mobile experience by itself is often not enough. Adaptive Web Design is a set of patterns that adhere to the Progressive Enhancement principle and we can use AWD to get better experiences for more capable devices. The conditional lazy loading pattern is especially interesting for our purposes.\"\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
