description: "Rich Gibson \n\nGigapanner, Gigapan.org\n\nRich Gibson works on the Gigapan and Explorable Microscopy Projects for Carnegie Melon University and NASA's Intelligent Robotics Group, and independently creating high resolution portraits of people and developing new ways to archive physical spaces with explorable images.\n\nHe is a bricoleur hacker, artist, programmer, author, and builder.\n\nHe helped create the Neogeography movement, coauthoring Mapping Hacks and Google Maps Hacks. The process of working with and exploring how we interact and explore space lead him to the more generalized world of providing both context, and detail with explorable images.\n\nFor the past four years he has been obsessed with creating new ways to capture and use high resolution images of everything, including the Chaos Communications Camp in 2007, Volcanos in Arizona for NASA, the incredibly tidy offices of Monochrom in Vienna, details of cell metosis in mouse testis with sub-micron resolution, and portraits of people with the details of landscapes."
