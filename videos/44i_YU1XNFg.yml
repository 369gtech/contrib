title: 'Metaprogramming with Groovy'
recordingDate: 1472637601
description: 'Groovy is a dynamic language that provides different types of metaprogramming techniques. In this talk we’ll mainly see runtime metaprogramming. You’ll understand the Groovy Meta-Object-Protocol (MOP), the metaclass, how to intercept method calls, how to deal with method missing and property missing, the use of mixins, traits and categories. All of these topics will be explained with examples in order to understand them.Also, you’ll see a little bit about compile-time metaprogramming with AST Transformations. AST Transformations provide a wonderful way of manipulating code at compile time via modifications of the Abstract Syntax Tree. You’ll see a basic but powerful example of what we can do with AST transformations.'
