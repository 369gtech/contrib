language: English
recordingDate: 1601026172
description: "Observability is a key component of reliable software engineering, whether in the cloud or on-premises. \nSteeltoe brings a portable observability story to .NET applications. It enables applications to be moved between environments without changing the codebase for observability.\nThis session explores the features that Steeltoe brings, such as:\n-Auto-collectors: EventCounters, EventListeners, and DiagnosticListeners \n-Exporters: Metrics, Trace, Prometheus actuators, and Zipkin\n-Integrations: Dashboards in Grafana, Wavefront, PCF (now part of VMware Tanzu), and Spring Boot Admin\n\nYou will see how tracing, logging, and metrics work together to provide the visibility needed for success in production enterprise environments.\n\nHananiel Sarella: Staff Software Engineer, VMware\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/observability-enhancements-in-steeltoe"
