description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nCompliance Beyond Security: a Cloud Native GDPR Implementation Experience - Johan Tordsson, Elastisys AB\n\nRegulatory compliance has traditionally been focused on core system aspects such as availability, data integrity, and overall IT system security. Compliance has been achieved through various processes and (security) tooling. With recent evolution of the regulatory landscape (including the European GDPR, Californian CCPA, and Japanese APPI legislations), there is a stronger focus on end user rights to data, in particular the right to be forgotten. This session will discuss the technical challenges of this movement and give some recommendations for how to address these issues in a cloud native setting. This includes how to handle (and timely remove) data across the full stack, including logs, backups, and any other sort of stateful resources."
