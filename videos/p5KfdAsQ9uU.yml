title: 'Automate Deployments To Kubernetes With Circle CI'
language: English
recordingDate: 1618045295
description: "Watch this short video to learn how to easily automate deployments to Kubernetes. \nIn this tutorial, we quickly go through the steps that you can take to create a CI/CD pipeline which deploys to Kubernetes. We take a codebase in GitHub and connect it with CircleCI, which is in turn directed to deploy to a Kubernetes cluster that has Cloud Foundry installed on it. \nWatch as each check in to version control triggers a new build and updates the app running live. \n\n\nPlease visit cf-for-k8s.io for more information about the Cloud Foundry For Kubernetes project. Join the community on Slack at slack.cloudfoundry.org."
