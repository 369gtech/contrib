description: "Cloud environments provide everything you need to develop a conventional application as a Service, completely obscuring the underlying infrastructure. This style of software development is called ’Serverless’ development. This could be the holy grail that saves development teams from maintenance and platform/server dependence.\n\nMany development teams are in the process of maintaining a monolithic application and are planning to migrate this application to a Serverless solution for this particular reason. But is this a valid reason in the context of the monolith? In this talk we will go through a brief history of how we got here, and look at the steps that need to be taken when you are considering such a migration.\n\nI will provide the insights from my own experience so far. Building a Serverless solution is completely different from conventional application development, which raises a ton of questions about whether this is a suitable replacement for the monolith. Development teams need to be aware of both the technical and cultural impact on their team and even the company itself before initiating the migration.\n\nEdwin Derks is a Software Architect from Ordina JTech. He has a passion for gathering and sharing knowledge about anything related to the Java ecosystem and cloud-driven development in general. He is a member of the Eclipse MicroProfile and Jakarta EE community, and is often hosting meetups, writing articles, blogs and speaking at conferences."
