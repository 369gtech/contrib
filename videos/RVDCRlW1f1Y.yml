description: "This talk will show how the miniKanren constraint logic programming language can be used to automatically generate Scheme code by example, a form of test-driven development on steroids. Our approach is unusual: we define an interpreter for Scheme as a relation, rather than as a standard function. We can use this \"relational interpreter\" to perform program synthesis, to automatically turn a proof checker into a theorem prover, to generate quines, and to perform other bizarre and fascinating tasks. We will also look at the current version of Barliman, a prototype Interactive Development Environment that will hopefully inspire future IDEs.\n\nMore details on website: http://www.codemesh.io/codemesh2017/william-e-byrd"
