description: 'The session will cover when and how to use Akka HTTP and remote actors to create a new generation of applications. The results of the performance tests we did to compare the two options will be shown as well. A live demo with Lego trains and a ferris wheel is of course included. We equipped Lego trains with a Raspberry Pi, camera, wireless dongle, infrared transmitter, speaker and a RFID reader. Next to that we have automated switch tracks and cameras again with the help of Raspberry Pis. To control the trains and other parts we built an actor based application with Scala and Akka.'
