title: 'Attacking Machine Learning Methods Used for Detection of Cyber Attackâ€” Jelena Milosevic'
language: English
recordingDate: 1584006904
description: "Number of users of connected devices and complexity of communication networks is increasing. This rises interest of attackers since there is more information to gain access to. At the same time, it makes network traffic analysis based on detection and prevention of cyber-attacks inherently complex. \n\nIn order to enable effective detection of cyber attacks, many machine learning methods are proposed. Main reasons are that they scale well with the increased amount of information, they are fast and, at the same time, provide opportunity to protect network users not just from known threats but also unknown variants of previous attacks (big advantage in comparison to previously used signature-based detectors). However, recent research on security of machine learning shows that there are various inherent properties of machine learning methods that allow attackers to bypass these methods once deployed in practice.\n\nIn this talk, I will first discuss machine learning methods suggested for detection of cyber attacks and discuss their detection performance. Then, I will show how to perform few recently proposed attacks on these machine learning methods and how such attacks can affect previously observed detection performance. Finally, I will outline current open problems in security of machine learning and detection of cyber attacks.\n\nVisit the largest developer playground in Europe!\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/wearedevelopers\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/WeAreDevs\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/_wearedevelopers/\n\n#WeAreDevs"
