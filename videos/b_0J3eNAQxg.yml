recordingDate: 1520641152
description: "In our March 2018 session, we explored error management, from raising to handling exceptions. We took a look at SAVE EXCEPTION with FORALL, LOG ERRORS, when it makes sense to \"swallow up\" an exception - though preferably not with WHEN OTHERS THEN NULL. \n\nAskTOM Office Hours offers free, monthly training and tips on how to make the most of Oracle Database, from Oracle product managers, developers and evangelists.\n\nhttps://asktom.oracle.com/\n\nOracle Developers portal: https://developer.oracle.com/\nSign up for an Oracle Cloud trial: https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/tryit\n\n\nmusic: bensound.com"
