description: "How to make money using Python - Unused potential in the Enterprise World\n[EuroPython 2018 - Talk - 2018-07-26 - Smarkets]\n[Edinburgh, UK]\n\nBy Marc-Andre Lemburg\n\nPython has gained quite some traction in the web development world and more recently as the goto language for anything that has to do with data science. However, it's use in the enterprise world of applications is rather limited.\n\nBased on the author's many years experience in working in enterprise environments, the talk will demonstrate areas in the business application space where Python has significant advantages over other languages, but which are currently dominated by applications written in Java, C++ or C#.\n\nThere are huge opportunities out there for companies to excel at and use the Python advantage to their benefit. If you are looking for a lead idea to kick start your Python business (and you have the resources to invest into marketing), this talk is for you.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2018.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
