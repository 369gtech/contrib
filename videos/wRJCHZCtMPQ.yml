title: 'E-learning vs. on site learning'
language: English
recordingDate: 1636523270
description: "Technical & pedagogical opportunities, challenges, and disruptions.\n\nThe topics about EdTech are endless, and will always center around learning. Anything that may inspire, enhance or just plain work to create great pedagogy in a digitized world. AR, VR, AI, LMS, e-learning, andragogics, mobile learning, constructive alignment, distance learning, lifelong learning - you name it, we will discuss it.\n\nEdTech Malmö is led by Fredrik Rutz, a university teacher, researcher, consultant and entrepreneur who is very interested in lifelong learning and how to accomplish it. Everybody learns, all the time, but how can we help them, both within informal and formal learning, both within practical and theoretical subjects? Or put another way, teaching theory via Zoom is relatively easy (or is it?), but can we have choir practice with participants all over the world, or teach an Australian technician how to mend a Jumbo jet when the teacher is in Malmö (and the plane is in Frankfurt)?\n\nAt this first event, Fredrik will talk about \"Digitally transform learning in a hurry – experiences from a pandemic\".\nWe will also discuss what this group should be about – what, why, and where is the future of e-learning and how do we get there.\n\n___________________________\nFoo Café is a meeting place for people with an interest in software development and IT. \nHere, user groups and partner companies find the perfect atmosphere for sharing knowledge and develop competence. \nFoo Café is open for everyone and is free to attend. To make an event at Foo Café, you have to become a partner company with us or you can run a user group with an in-depth technical focus.\nWe welcome companies with sponsor challenges.\nWe are currently present in Stockholm and Malmö and have made over 2048 tech events since the start in 2012. \nAt Foo Café there’s an event going on everyday, year round."
