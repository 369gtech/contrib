description: "Incident Response in Unfamiliar Sociotechnical Systems: One Incident Commander's Challenges Supporting Inter-organizational Anomaly Response in the Age of COVID-19\n\nMorgan Collins, Salesforce\n\nThe Incident Command System (ICS) has become an increasingly utilized tool for incident response within modern enterprise software and cloud computing organizations. With the unique challenges of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, companies are also seeing the introduction of additional strain on organizations that are working to facilitate mission critical support while adjusting to rapidly increasing service load as a result of a historic increase in remote work and web commerce opportunities. I welcome you to join me as I go into hilarious detail on the origins of ICS, the ways that I have seen it adopted within private enterprise, and the challenges that have been encountered from the increased interorganizational incident response as a result of COVID-19. From there, I'll discuss ways I recommend tackling these problems, as well as how to utilize immediate post incident discussions to strengthen lessons learned and expertise moving forward.\n\nView the full SREcon20 Americas program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon20americas/program"
