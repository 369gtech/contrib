description: "http://oreil.ly/DistNetData\n\nSensors are the future of distributed data. General-purpose computing is dissipating out into the environment and becoming increasingly invisible and embedded into our lives. We will soon begin to move in a sea of data, our movements tracked and our environments measured and adjusted to our preferences, without need for direct intervention.\n\nAt the Strata Conference in New York last year, we gave attendees a taste of the super-connected world that's ahead of all of us by instrumenting the conference environment with basic off-the-shelf sensors and mesh networking. At the Strata Conference in Santa Clara this February, we will observe and report on the conference once again, with more sensors, real-time visualization, and some new interactive features for attendees."
