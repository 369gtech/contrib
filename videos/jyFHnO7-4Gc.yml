title: 'Data’s Role in Moon Missions: Fictional and Real'
language: English
recordingDate: 1603458023
description: "Completing a successful Moon Mission doesn’t only involve getting to the moon, but also returning safely to Earth – ideally with some rocks to learn from! Join Dr. G as she draws inspiration from the new Netflix Original Over the Moon (https://www.netflix.com/title/80214236) and the ingenuity of the NASA Apollo missions to analyze and clean data to predict how much moon rock astronauts might be able to bring back as part of the Artemis Program in 2024. No coding experience required, and you can follow along with the free Microsoft Learn lessons at https://aka.ms/LearnWithDrG/OverTheMoon.\n\nVisual Studio Code Environment Setup:\nhttps://aka.ms/LearnOnVSCode\nhttps://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/data-science-tutorial\n\nLunar Rocks Curation Site: \nhttps://curator.jsc.nasa.gov/lunar/\n\nBe sure to check out the next Live Stream: https://aka.ms/LearnWithDrG/UpcomingLiveStream\n\n00:00 - Introduction and Agenda for the episode\n02:49 - Setup local environment guidelines\n03:56 - Setup for this project and intro to Python notebooks in VSCode\n06:40 - Choosing data for analysis - NASA Lunar Rock Curation\n07:51 - Discussion on importance of weight in space exploration\n08:56 - Defining problem to solve through data science practices\n10:45 - Import and explore data into notebook with pandas\n14:12 - Manipulate rock sample data to match rocket data\n18:30 - Create dataframe to view data based on unique missions\n20:23 - Add total sample amount for each mission\n23:05 - Comparing missions\n24:09 - Removing not-a-number values\n25:04 - Add rocket ship data into dataframe\n26:47 - Add rocket payload data and determine ratios\n29:00 - Add Artemis data\n30:42 - Estimate sample weight per Artemis mission\n31:37 - Determining the right samples to collect\n36:00 - Exploring the cut of samples to prioritize\n38:00 - Finalizing the samples that represent the profile for new samples\n40:09 - Create the dataframe final profile for new sample gathering\n44:50 - Determine recommendations based on Artemis constraints\n47:01 - Recap"
