description: "Smart Interface Design Patterns, 2020 Edition\n\nYou’re a smart cookie. If you have to deliver something on a tough deadline, of course you will. And because we don't have time, we rely on things that used to work in the past, or the things that everybody else around us does. Yet too often these solutions aren't ideal for your particular context. And so before you know it, the conversion goes down, or traffic shatters, or there are more complaints in your customer support. How do we avoid that?\n\nBy testing, of course. In this brand new talk, Vitaly Friedman, the creative lead of Smashing Magazine and a consultant working with European Parliament, Haufe, Marc'o'Polo, Zalando and a few other companies, will show some complex, smart interface design patterns that work. We'll look into hamburger icon navigation, carousels and mega-drop-downs, onboarding, mega-drop-downs, sliders, maps and web forms.\n\nKeep in mind: you won’t be able to unsee the things you’ll see in this session. You’ll leave with a toolbox of practical techniques that you’ll be able to apply to your work right away.\n\nPrezentacja miała miejsce 4/08/2020"
