description: "Hands Free is a way to pay for items at participating stores without taking out your wallet or your phone. To get started with Hands Free, all you need to do is download the Hands Free app and set up your profile (photo, name, and payment method). When you tell the cashier, “I'll pay with Google,” the cashier can look you up on their point-of-sale system and charge your account. To confirm that you’re at the store where you’re making the purchase, Hands Free uses Bluetooth Low Energy, Wi-Fi, location services, and other signals from your phone.\n\nIn this video, Aston Lau introduces Hands Free payments and explains how a merchant can integrate it into their POS using the Hands Free API.\n\nSubscribe to the Google Developers YouTube channel: http://goo.gl/mQyv5L"
