description: 'Functional state systems like Redux have made web development easier to reason about -- how can we apply these techniques to complex distributed systems? And what lessons from the distributed world can we bring back to web development? This talk explores concurrency models through the lens of a virtual guinea pig colony, and covers topics including actors, sagas, emergent behavior, and the unexpected virtue of object-oriented programming.'
