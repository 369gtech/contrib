description: "Have you ever struggled with prioritizing a security feature (or backlog issue), or even struggled with describing your security feature so your stakeholders understand why it is important?\n\nAll products needs to take security into account. However, spending to much time on security can be just as bad for your product as spending to little.\nIn this talk, I will show why we need to treat security features just as any other functional feature, and how this can be done.\nAfter managing security products for 15 years, I have learned some techniques that makes defining security features easier.\n\n\nSave the date for NDC TechTown 2020  (31st of August - 3rd of September)\n\nCheck out more of our talks at: \nhttps://ndctechtown.com/\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/"
