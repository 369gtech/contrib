title: 'Francesco Tisiot – Kickstart your Kafka with Faker Data'
recordingDate: 1628584634
description: "We all love to play with the shiny toys, but an event stream with no events is a sorry sight. In this session you’ll see how to create your own streaming dataset for Apache Kafka using Python and the Faker library. You’ll learn how to create a random data producer and define the structure and rate of its message delivery. Randomly-generated data is often hilarious in its own right, and it adds just the right amount of fun to any Kafka and its integrations!\n\nSpeaker: \nFrancesco Tisiot – https://2021.berlinbuzzwords.de/member/francesco-tisiot\n\nMore: https://2021.berlinbuzzwords.de/session/kickstart-your-kafka-faker-data"
