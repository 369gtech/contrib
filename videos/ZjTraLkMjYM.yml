description: "Vitess at HubSpot: How We Moved Hundreds of MySQL Databases into Kubernetes - Tom Petr & Alexander Charis, HubSpot \n\nIn early 2017, HubSpot faced a growing problem: our MySQL infrastructure was complex, expensive, and failing to scale. Hundreds of databases running on more than a thousand EC2 instances were managed by just one person, and developers were getting fed up and began to migrate to other higher performance but non-relational datastores. We surveyed the landscape and decided to address these challenges by adopting Vitess and Kubernetes. This talk will detail our journey towards MySQL cloud-native nirvana. We'll cover lessons learned, bugs squashed, and tools built -- including the design and operation of our very own Kubernetes operator for Vitess. Attendees will walk away with a better understanding of what it takes to reliably manage and scale MySQL databases in Kubernetes, and how Vitess is a great tool for the job. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/Gras"
