description: "IoT has failed to live up to its potential because it’s too complicated, requires too many esoteric skillsets, is too expensive and isn’t secure. Enough already! It’s time to use the open, proven, W3C technologies that we all understand. The world doesn’t need another wire protocol. It needs simplicity to drive value for business and society. Join Rob as he illustrates how the future of the Internet of Things will be based on the web that’s all around us. \n\nEVENT:\n\nNode+JS Interactive 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nRob Tiffany\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nLinux Foundation provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T0NBQ39KKg"
