description: "Despite the internet becoming an increasingly visual place, the algorithms we use to explore it haven’t developed much since the text-heavy web of the 90s/00s. We’re exploring a new approach to image search at Wellcome Collection. Using some neat computer vision and NLP tricks, we’re connecting search queries to images’ visual features directly and removing the need for rich descriptive captions.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
