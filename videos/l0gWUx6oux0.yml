title: 'Ingest and Process Rail Car Events in Real Time using Oracle Cloud'
language: English
recordingDate: 1626178278
description: "A Rail car produces numerous events as it goes along its journey. This event data needs to be captured in real time and processed so that it can be used to track and in future analyze the routes of the rail car. In this video we ingest real time rail car events (Stream Producer mocked using OCI Java SDK) using Oracle Streaming Service and perform 2 types of processing on the data. \n\n• Fast processing – Real Time processing as data is being ingested into the Stream. This is achieved by an application acting as the Stream Consumer continuously monitoring the stream for new data. This application is running on the Oracle Kubernetes Cluster for easy scalability, orchestration, and deployment. Raw data is stored in Object Storage bucket as a csv file as well as in an Autonomous Database table. Fast Processed data is stored in a different table within the database\n\n• Slow Processing – Lengthy and timely processing must be done on the data at regular interval. This is achieved by another application leveraging Oracle Serverless Functions. This function can be invoked by a cron job from within the Kubernetes cluster or by a manual trigger using a rest api call to the api gateway endpoint on which the function has been exposed. This application with further clean and filter the event data and the slow processed data will hence stored in a separate table within our database. \nOnce the data has been cleaned and processed to the liking, this data can be used to get multiple insights based on the events generated by the rail car and hence used for analysis and decision making for the forthcoming journey."
