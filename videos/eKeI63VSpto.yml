description: "Check out https://g.co/aiexperiments to learn more.\n\nThis is an experiment built with machine learning that lets you make music with the computer just by taking a picture. It uses image recognition to label what it sees, then it turns those labels into lyrics of a song. http://g.co/aiexperiments\n\nBuilt by Eric Rosenbaum, Yotam Mann, and friends at Google Creative Lab using MaryTTS, Tone.js, and Google Cloud Vision API. Features music by Giorgio Moroder.\n\nMore resources:\nhttps://cloud.google.com/vision/\nhttps://github.com/marytts/marytts\nhttps://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js"
