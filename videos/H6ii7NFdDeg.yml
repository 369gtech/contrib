description: "Binary logistic regression is a machine learning algorithm most useful when we want to model the event probability for a categorical response variable with two outcomes (yes/no, true/false, etc.). In this video we'll build a sentiment classifier app that uses binary logistic regression to classify tweets as either happy, sad, or neutral. I'll use animations, code, rap, skits, and equations to explain how it all works. Enjoy!\n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/logistic_regression\n\nPlease Subscribe! And like.
