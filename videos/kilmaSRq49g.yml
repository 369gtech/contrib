title: 'Google I/O 2013 - Demystifying MVP and EventBus in GWT'
language: English
recordingDate: 1368813377
description: "Erik Kuefler \n\nIn 2009, Ray Ryan gave a talk at Google I/O advocating the Model-View-Presenter pattern and the EventBus for architecting GWT applications. Since then, MVP and the EventBus have become widespread in the GWT community and several frameworks have appeared to support them. However, there's still a lot of confusion over what MVP actually is and the best way to implement it. Many common solutions involve tedious amounts of boilerplate and overhead. In this talk, I will demonstrate that using MVP and the EventBus correctly is easier than you probably think it is and can be done without any frameworks or extra overhead. The end result is a more testable, maintainable GWT application that is a pleasure to work with.\n\nFor all I/O 2013 sessions, go to https://developers.google.com/live"
