description: "Clang is a modern open-source C/C++ compiler, providing support for the latest language standards, high performance, excellent diagnostics and hackability.\nLately, there has been an effort to make it compatible with MSVC on Windows.\nThis allows Windows developers to use Clang directly with their existing Visual Studio workflow and enables new tools, such as AddressSanitizer.\n\nThis talk will cover the background of LLVM and Clang, the benefits of using Clang on Windows, challenges involved in the port (including details on how C++ works under the hood), and demos.\n\nSlides to the presentation: http://www.hanshq.net/files/foocafe_oct_2014.pdf.ï»¿\n"
