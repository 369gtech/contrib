title: 'Webinar: Hybrid Serverless Development Using Quarkus and Kubernetes'
language: English
recordingDate: 1599859721
description: "Fast-moving forward to hybrid/multi-cloud stack, it’s inevitable for developers not only considering implementing serverless microservices once but also integrate with the multi-serverless platforms on Kubernetes as the smallest/fastest as they can. In this session, we’ll explore how Quarkus, Kubnertes Native Java Stack allows developers to write traditional microservices and make them deployable functions to multiple Serverless Platforms(i.e. Knative + Kubernetes, Amazon Lambda, etc.).\n\nPresenter:\n\nDaniel Oh, Principal Technical Marketing Manager @RedHat and CNCF Ambassador"
