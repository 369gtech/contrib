recordingDate: 1412860197
description: "This presentation is in Swedish.\n\nThe next version of ASP.NET has been redesigned from the ground up to be a lean and composable framework for building web and cloud applications, and it’s fully open source! At the same time, Microsoft is busy building their next major version of Visual Studio (14) that will ship with a new, much more tightly integrated compiler called Roslyn. We'll explore the opportunities/benefits of Roslyn, dive into examples and discuss how this will\nbe a game changer for the IDE and the intelligent tooling space. With these new technologies combined, we get a sneak peek of the web development experience of tomorrow."
