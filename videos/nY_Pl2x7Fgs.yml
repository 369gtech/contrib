recordingDate: 1382968923
description: "A talk from Barcelona Ruby Conference 2013 (http://baruco.org)\n\nMany developers try to avoid yak shaving. In this talk we will attempt to explore the joys of shaving a yak. We'll explore new features of Active Record, along with techniques for performance improvements. All which were realized through the journey of software development, rather than the goal. Yak shaving can get hairy, but with enough mousse, we can tame any mane.\n\nhttp://www.baruco.org/talks/yak-shaving-is-best-shaving\n\nRecorded & produced by El Cocu (http://elcocu.com)"
