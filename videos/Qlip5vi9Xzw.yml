description: "Those who know what the future brings we call futurists. Those who know when one thing will happen we call billionaires. Entrepreneurs know this and cite timing issues are the primary causes for their success and failure. How do you calibrate your temporal senses? How can you know when to hold them and when to fold them? It turns out that we can learn from history if we know of a theory of industry development. This is a presentation of data and the patterns that support this theory.\n\nHorace has eight years of experience as an industry analyst and business development manager at Nokia, preceded by six years of software development and management in a startup environment, two years of IT management and five years of computer science research in an industrial laboratory.\n\nHorace has an MBA from Harvard Business School and MS Engineering from Tufts University.\n\nFor more on YOW!
