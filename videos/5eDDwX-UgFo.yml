recordingDate: 1468311166
description: 'This presentation is about the world of asynchronous programming in Java, where everything is a stream. We’ll talk about how reactive extensions change the way you design Java applications. You’ll see how to consume observable streams of events and apply a variety of operators offered by the RXJava library, which requires a different way of thinking about writing code.'
