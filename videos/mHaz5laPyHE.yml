description: "\"A Day Has Only 24±1 Hours\n[EuroPython 2019 - Talk - 2019-07-11 - Boston]\n[Basel, CH]\n\nBy Miroslav Šedivý\n\nOn the last Sunday of October you may get “one more hour of sleep” but as well may spend much more time debugging code dealing with the time zones, daylight saving time shifts and datetime stuff in general.\n\nWe'll look at a few pitfalls you may encounter when working with datetimes in Python. We'll dissect the pytz library, explain why it contains over 500 individual time zones while focusing on the 63 entries in Europe. We'll also find the reason why pytz is not part of the standard Python, why it gets updated so often and why even that won't solve all your problems. Do you know what happens after 2021 when the EU stops DST switching?\n\nTwo centuries of short-sighted propaganda and long-term chaos in forty-five minutes. Maybe that will make you want to avoid time zones in your code altogether!\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2019.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/\n\n    \""
