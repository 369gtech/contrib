description: "Google Tech Talks\nJune 28, 2007\n\nABSTRACT\n\nInexpensive broadband routers are a popular way for people to create an internal, and sometimes wireless, network in their homes. By purchasing such a router and plugging it in, they can have a network set up in seconds. Unfortunately, by visiting a malicious web page, a person can inadvertently open up his router for attack; settings on the router can be changed, including the DNS servers used by the members of this small, quickly erected internal network. This talk examines this attack in depth, and will lead to discussion about similar dangers that emerge when commonly used technologies are abused.  Credits: Speaker:Sid Stamm"
