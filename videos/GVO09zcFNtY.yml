title: 'Microservice Swarms: Decentralized Discovery and Scaling - Allen Holub'

description: 'Microservice swarming is a technique for microservices to scale and balance load directly, with no need for centralized discovery or other heavyweight single points of failure in the system.A Swarm architecture is a server-side architecture based on small, independent microservices that use a set of simple rules to automatically scale based on actual load. The services are highly decoupled, There is no need for a single-point-of-failure discovery service or external load balancing, the systems are extremely robust, adaptive, and maintainable. This session looks in depth at the architecture of a Swarming system, focusing in implementation. We''ll cover lightweight messaging, microservice structure, and look in depth at how the system scales and adapts to actual use as it runs.'
