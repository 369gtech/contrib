description: "Talk recording from Amsterdam JSNation Conference 2019 https://jsnation.com\n\n# Post mortem NodeJS debugging\n\nPost-Mortem debugging is a really powerful technique that allows you, through the use of several tools, to take a memory dump when an issue occurs in your application and later analyze it offline.\n\nThe talk will primarily focus on llnode and how you can use this tool to better understand why a Node.js process is behaving odd or is crashing."
