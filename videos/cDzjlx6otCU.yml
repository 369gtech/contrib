description: 're-frame is a ClojureScript library for writing single page applications built on top of Reagent that implements a well-defined architecture. Performant and production ready, re-frame has been gaining traction in the ClojureScript community due in part to a development experience that is is understandable to beginners and continues to be effective as applications grow and change. In this talk we will be examining the architecture, design, and features of re-frame including recent changes from the major v0.8.0 release.'
