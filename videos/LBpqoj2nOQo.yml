description: 'How do you create interesting artwork solely through programming? Can we turn our aesthetics into code? Generative artwork allows us to play with these questions, examine the world around us, and enjoy the act of pure programming. I’m going to discuss how programming and artwork make interesting partners, and how a programmer’s version of artwork can make the world more enjoyable.'
