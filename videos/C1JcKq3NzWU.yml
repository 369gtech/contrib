language: English
recordingDate: 1560797624
description: "Igalia has been working on the CSS Grid Layout implementation in Chromium/Blink and Safari/WebKit since 2013. You heard about grid for a long time and it was finally shipped in Firefox, Chrome and Safari almost simultaneously in 2017. Most of you probably know how to use grid and you might already be using it in your projects. In this talk we are not going to talk about how grid layout works, instead we will discuss how it's implemented in the browser.\n\nManuel Rego has been part of the team working on Grid Layout since 2014. He will share his experience implementing a CSS spec in a web rendering engine as well as address different aspects of the implementation process, highlighting some interesting details and explaining some issues that appeared along the way. Hopefully, after the talk you'll better understand what's going on behind the scenes when you use CSS Grid Layout in a webpage, and what it takes to implement a CSS feature in a web browser.\n\nSlides: https://people.igalia.com/mrego/talks/css-day-2019-css-grid-layout/\nAbout Manuel: https://www.igalia.com/igalian/mrego\nFollow Manuel: https://twitter.com/regocas\n\nMore about CSS Day: https://cssday.nl or https://twitter.com/cssdayconf\nReceive conference announcements in your inbox: https://cssday.nl/subscribe"
