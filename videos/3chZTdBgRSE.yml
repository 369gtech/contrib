title: '"Using a cloud to manage a cloud" - Alex Sharp, Andrew Reimers (LCA 2020)'
recordingDate: 1578987141
description: "Alex Sharp, Andrew Reimers\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/143/\n\nQubesOS is a Xen based desktop operating system that is a user friendly frontend to a powerful backend, managing hypervisor backed containers called 'Qubes'. OrionVM is a wholesale cloud infrastructure provider, and it has been using QubesOS to help make its sysadmin easier. This talk is partly an overview of QubesOS and how it works, and partly an overview of how we used it, what we found useful and what still needs to be worked on.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n#linux.conf.au #linux #foss #opensource\n\nMon Jan 13 16:35:00 2020 at Arena"
