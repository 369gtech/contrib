description: 'Are you programmer? Might you are wondering what does machine learning mean from practical point of view. And you have no idea how to start? Or even worse, it looks so complicated to you? Hm... i had the same observations when I started my journey in machine learning world. Let me show you machine learning from other side. Why should you card about ML? For today, ML has a big impact on our world. About 30 billions have been invest in AI in 2016 and this number only increase in next years. EU market needs about 11 millions in 2020 (almost x2 more than few years ago) specialists related with data. The market needs people who can build and understand machine learning model in real life (not only in labs). During a presentation, i''ll show you how a machine learning process looks like. What is a deep learning and how you can apply it? What is convolutional neural network. And how transfer learning can simplify your life. You''ll see the (python) code. And during or after presentation you can repeat it by yourself (demo will be available on GitHub).'
