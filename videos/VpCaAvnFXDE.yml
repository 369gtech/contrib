description: "Guix is a functional package manager. What does that mean? How is it different from, say, dpkg or rpm, and how can it help me manage my systems and develop software? How can we help it take over the world? And what does Nix have to do with all this? \n___________________________\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry.
