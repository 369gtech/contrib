language: English
recordingDate: 1450064377
description: "Java SE is ideal for building lightweight microservices, and such services are increasingly being deployed to the cloud. Cloud platforms are attractive deployment targets, due to their high availability; affordability; ease of management; and access to services such as object storage, messaging, and databases. And when well-architected, cloud applications typically exhibit several desirable qualities such as portability, updatability, configurability, composability, and scalability. This session explores the anatomy of a typical Java SE cloud application, the architectural impact of running on a cloud platform, and design patterns used to achieve the various desirable “-ilities” as well as frameworks that simplify development.\n\nSpeakers:\nGerrit Grunwald, Technology Evangelist, Oracle\nGerrit Grunwald is a developer evangelist with more than ten years of experience in software development.
