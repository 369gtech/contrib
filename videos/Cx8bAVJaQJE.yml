Several Java developer efforts have brought open source development processes and new levels of transparency and participation into their communities. The Java Community Process (JCP) program celebrates twenty years of Java standards development in 2018. Since the initiation of efforts to expand the developer participation in the Java community, Java standards development is more open that it ever has been.\n\nHeather VanCura From Oracle\nHeather leads the Java Community standardization efforts at Oracle, and is a leader of the global community driven adoption user group programs.
