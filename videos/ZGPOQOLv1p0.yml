description: "https://2018.jsconf.is/speakers/nicole-chung/\n\nYes, it’s still experimental, but you can build a peer-to-peer real-time connection using WebRTC - a connection that shares audio, video, files in a fast, highly secure, decentralized manner.\n\nIn this talk, we will cover how to open up a peer connection using JavaScript, and how to transmit data via a data channel.\n\nWe will demystify the underlying technologies of the WebRTC protocols (STUN and TURN for example) and show you that it’s possible to store files in a safe, highly secure and decentralized way."
