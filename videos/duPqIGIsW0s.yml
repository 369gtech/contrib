description: "PyData Tel Aviv Meetup #27\n11 September 2019\nSponsored and Hosted by Salesforce\nhttps://www.meetup.com/PyData-Tel-Aviv/\n\nAt Twiggle, we learn and understand users' queries and match their relevant products. To that end, we are building our own ontology of the world, and an advanced Natural Language Analyzer which aims to map both queries and products from across the e-commerce domain onto our ontology. Building an ontology is a tedious task which requires both specialized expertise as well as a broad look on the way the world is built. To facilitate that process, we have developed a unique algorithm. The algorithm generates a data-driven ontology by applying Node2Vec and clustering methods on query-to-product clicks along with minimal information about these products. In this talk, we will discuss this algorithm and offer a deep dive into the methods we used.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nFind a PyData chapter near you: meetup.com/pro/pydata"
