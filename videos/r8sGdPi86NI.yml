This presentation discusses how to use the Users API to get basic information about the user, and gives code samples to get you on your way to \_providing a personalized experience for each user.\n\nLearn how to use OAuth to allow a user to grant limited permission to a third party (be it another user or a web application) to access a web application on their behalf."
