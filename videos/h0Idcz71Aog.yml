description: "Take a Deep Dive into JUnit 5 with core committer Sam Brannen!\n\nOver the last decade a lot has happened in the world of Java and testing, but JUnit 4 hasn't kept up. Now JUnit 5 is here to help shape the future of testing on the JVM with a focus on Java 8 language features, extensibility, and a modern programming API for testing in Java. Moreover, JUnit isn't just a Java testing framework anymore. Third parties are already developing test engines for Scala, Groovy, Kotlin, etc. that run on the new JUnit Platform.\n\nThis session starts off with an overview of the inspiration for & architecture of JUnit 5, from launchers to test engines. Sam will then take the audience on a live coding tour, highlighting support for tagging, custom display names, dependency injection, repeated tests, parameterized tests, conditional test execution, lambda expressions for assertions, assumptions, & dynamic tests, and implementing tests via interface default methods (a.k.a., testing traits).\n\nNext, Sam will present the new extension model in JUnit Jupiter, discussing how to author and register extensions for conditional tests, parameter resolution (a.k.a., dependency injection), lifecycle callbacks, & more.\n\nTo round off the session, Sam will quickly showcase the new JUnit Jupiter support in Spring Framework 5.0.\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2017\nSam Brannen, Co-Founder, Swiftmind"
