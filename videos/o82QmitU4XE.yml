description: "http://www.oscon.com\nDo you need a copyleft license to build a community? Answering this ten years ago, the answer may have been yes, primarily driven by the contractual obligation to contribute back to the project. However, looking at the question now, open source has grown such that a vibrant, active community may be built with a permissive licensing model. Come hear some thoughts about how licensing models affect building an open source community and how their use has evolved over time.\n\nThis keynote is sponsored by HP\n\nhttp://www.oscon.com/oscon2013/public/schedule/detail/31413"
