description: "Rodney Sowirono\nOracle\n\nAs a web front-end developer, you most probably will face challenges on how to visualise data, whether is a calendar, chart, or various associated views. The first thing you’ll probably do is to look for - or use a JavaScript framework you’re familiar with, that provides you the code to present those visualisations on a webpage. However, that only solves a part of your challenge. The hard part and most time consuming, is on binding that data to your visualization web part which often end up using multiple libraries and securing the web part, service call not being used on unaffiliated sites. In this session we will look at how we can build appealing data visualisation web parts that can easily be built with minimum JavaScript coding."
