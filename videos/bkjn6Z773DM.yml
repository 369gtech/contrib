description: "Phil Wilkins\nSenior Consultant\nCapgemini UK Plc\n\nWhilst microservices are mainstream thinking, many organisations make significant long-term investments in application containers such as WebLogic and can be reluctant to move away from such investments to lightweight containers. So how do we realise the microservice thinking with such constraints? This presentation looks at several approaches that we have taken with our customers that can allow us to leverage microservice thinking without sacrificing the existing investment. These approaches will mean that the transition to a pure microservice approach is far easier and less disruptive to delivery. Many of these strategies presented are being applied with customers today successfully."
