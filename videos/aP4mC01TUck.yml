description: "Learn Live: Foundations of Data Science for Machine Learning - Introduction to data for machine learning: September 28 – Episode 03\n\nJoin the chat and ask questions live at https://aka.ms/LearnLiveTV\n\nStarting Tuesday, September 14, 2021 (PST), join Jason DeBoever and Glenn Stephens live on Learn TV and explore this nine-part “Foundations of data science for machine learning” series. Each week, we will be walking through Learn modules and answering your questions live. From basic classical machine learning models to exploratory data analysis and customizing architectures, you’ll be guided by easy to digest conceptual content and interactive Jupyter notebooks and will learn about the underlying concepts as well as how to get into building models with the most common machine learning tools.\n\nSeptember 28 - Episode 3 :\nFollow along and complete the free, hands-on Microsoft Learn modules at https://aka.ms/LearnML-Introduction\n\nThe power of machine learning models comes from the data that is used to train them. Through content and exercises, we explore how to understand your data, how to encode it so that the computer can interpret it properly, how to clean it of errors, and tips that will help you create models that perform well. In this episode, you will:\n\nVisualize large datasets with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).\nClean a dataset of errors.\nPredict unknown values using numeric and categorical data.\n\nMiss an episode?
