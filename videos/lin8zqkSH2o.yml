title: '"From the Inside Out: Building a City Vacancy Portal" by Jonathan Leek and Laura Ginn'
language: English
recordingDate: 1539447361
description: "The City of Saint Louis has a wealth of data concerning vacant properties. Unfortunately, like many cities, it also has a data management problem. Data regarding vacant parcels is fractured, spread across many databases owned and maintained by numerous agencies and departments using a variety of technologies. In order to fully understand and eventually address this problem, a group of concerned citizens has begun building a single source of truth; a central data repository that normalizes and visualizes the problem not just for policy makers and city officials, but for normal citizens as well. In this talk, we will look at how this data portal was made, and how determined volunteers with the right skills can effect local government.\n\nSpeakers: Jonathan Leek and Laura Ginn"
