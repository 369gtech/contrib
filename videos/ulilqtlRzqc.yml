description: "A developer employs syntax highlighting to visually differentiate portions of her code; for centuries, designers, printers, and scribes have done the same for readers. Today, advanced features built into fonts can subtly signify types of content, increase a text’s authority, and are actually necessary for many languages.\nThis talk introduces designers and developers to highlighting\nsyntaxes beyond code. Learn how to access these advanced typographic features using CSS and JavaScript, and—more importantly—where to apply them.\nKenneth is an independent designer specialising in web typography. He organises Vancouver’s typography meetup Type\nBrigade, and contributes to The Lost Type Co-op. Previously he studied type design at Type@Paris, and helped launch the front-end development tool Surge.sh.\n\nSource: https://2016.cssconf.asia/\nSlides: \n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
