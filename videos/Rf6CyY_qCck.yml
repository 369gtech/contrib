title: 'A Year in Flink: The most important changes of the last versions'
recordingDate: 1635787804
description: "Another year has passed and the Flink community was very busy creating 3 new major releases containing more than 7000 commits and 3000 resolved issues. The included changes reach from the batch execution over the reactive mode to support for stateful Python UDFs. As a community member, it can be an increasingly difficult task to stay on top of all these developments and to understand what benefits the individual features bring. In this talk, I want to walk you through Flink’s most important new features which have been completed in the past year. I will explain the benefits and limitations of the new additions and tell you how they fit into the bigger picture. Moreover, I want to give you an outlook on what’s coming with the next Flink releases\n\n0:00 Apache Flink in 2021\n1:50 Batch - Streaming Unification\n11:05 SQL\n17:56 Connectors\n22:42 Operations & Observability"
