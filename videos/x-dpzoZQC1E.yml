title: 'From bits to legs to locomotion: Building a hexapod from the ground up'
recordingDate: 1579222069
description: "Daniel McCarthy\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/93/\n\nHexapods are six legged robots which are a staple in academic and hobbyist circles due to their versatility and static stability. Hexapod platforms however, specifically six degree of freedom (6DOF) Hexapod kits are commonly quite expensive. Expensive enough that I couldn't afford one -- So, I set out to build an inexpensive (order of magnitude cheaper) 6DOF Hexapod.\r\n\r\nThis talk is aimed at beginner and intermediate hobbyists who are interested in more advanced robotics topics, it sets out to to answer one main question: How on earth does one design and build a 6DOF Hexapod (hardware and software) from the ground up?\r\n\r\nIn it the design process, challenges and trade-offs as well as how one gets a Hexapod to walk without tripping over itself (inverse kinematics and gait algorithms) will be examined.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
