description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2019 by Sandra Dupré, Disney Streaming Services.\n\nMore info: http://androidmakers.fr/schedule/?sessionId=AMU-5195\n\nAfter TensorFlow Lite, MLKit promises to be the new tool to make apps smarter. The possibility to integrate a model directly on Firebase is crazy, but the second part (often put aside) deserves attention.\nBased in majority on deprecated Mobile Vision, the few models offered by Google already give us something to enjoy. Most of them is available offline: so we can imagine the extent of the possibilities!\n\nCome with me to discover these APIs: how and why to use them.\n\nAlex Karp Production"
