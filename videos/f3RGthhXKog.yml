description: "JanJaap Lahpor - Senior DevOps Manager, Intuit\nHarish Jayakumar - Lead Solutions Engineer, Docker Inc\n\nIn this talk we will share how a small team at Intuit moved Docker from local to production serving real and critical workloads. We will share how we addressed the organization challenges of running Docker at large enterprises by building a business case for a pilot project to prove the value of containers and its real world application. Next, we will share how we solved the technical challenges that present themselves when taking Docker from local to production in a corporate data center. We will share the blueprint for the business case and the associated pilot which laser focused on running stateless back-end services throughout the entire SDLC. Finally, we will highlight our crawl-walk-run approach that allowed us to make inexpensive mistakes before investing in the right areas as our Docker knowledge increased. We will share the major technical issues we encountered, how we overcame them and the lessons we learned."
