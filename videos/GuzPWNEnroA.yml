description: 'Even if you don''t see them, containers are what''s running your code in most serverless platforms. By using containers directly, you can write serverless apps in almost any language and bundle any runtimes or binaries. Learn how Knative, the open source project from Google, Pivotal, Red Hat and more, provides an industry standard way to build serverless platforms and run your serverless apps on top of Kubernetes. Knative lets you tune scaling parameters, run on hardware with GPUs or multi-core processors, and more.'
