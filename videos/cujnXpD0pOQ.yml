description: "Agile Breakup – Lessons Learned\n\nA tale of an after happily ever after.\nApplying agile practices in a partnership is a new way to encounter the fragility of modern long-term relationships. Unfortunately my wife and I missed that opportunity and started with the new trend by applying the mindset during our breakup after being 11 years a dream couple.\r\n\nWhat you get?\r\n\nTwo coaches with a very high reflection level, one year time for hundreds of hours of discussions, thousands hours of working through emotions, therapists, tons of “stuff tried out”, and lots of drama (maybe not so much in the talk :P)\r\n\nReflected it, condensed it and abstracted it to be able to apply the most impacting strategies on agile software development."
