title: '"Considerations for using NoSQL technology on your next IT project" by Akmal Chaudhri'
recordingDate: 1383742403
description: 'Over the past few years, we have seen the emergence and growth of NoSQL technology. This has attracted interest from organizations looking to solve new business problems. There are also examples of how this technology has been used to bring practical and commercial benefits to some organizations. However, since it is still an emerging technology, careful consideration is required in finding the relevant developer skills and choosing the right product. This presentation will discuss these issues in greater detail. In particular, it will focus on some of the leading NoSQL products and will discuss their architectures and suitability for different problems. Short code examples, using Java, with several leading NoSQL products are planned to give the audience a feel for the practical aspects of such products.'
