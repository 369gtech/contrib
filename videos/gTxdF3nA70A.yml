description: "A successful data science project is one that results in implementation, e.g., putting a model into production or using the result to support an organizational change. But implementation is only partially a technical problem. Successful implementation depends on people. This talk will cover multi-level stakeholder analysis, and techniques for engagement from project scoping to delivery of results.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
