description: "Spreadsheet files are often used to share interesting & important data. But spreadsheet applications aren't always the best tool for processing that data. I'll show you how to use OpenPyXL to work with that data in a way that's better than using .csv files. I'll also discuss common problems faced when working with spreadsheets via code. \"State of the art\" moves fast here, thus the title.\n\nEVENT: PyOhio 2017\n\nSPEAKER: Kojo Idrissa\n\nPERMISSIONS: The original video was published on the Next Day Video YouTube channel with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nORIGINAL SOURCE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5Ak0aTuKMA"
