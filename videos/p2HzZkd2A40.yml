The core WebRTC APIs getUserMedia, RTCPeerConnection and DataChannel have now been implemented across Chrome and Firefox.\n\nIn this session, we show you how to get started with building a WebRTC app:\n- what's a MediaStream (aka getUserMedia) and how can I use it?\n- resolution constraints\n- signalling: what is it and how can I set it up?\n- servers: what do I need?\n- RTCPeerConnection: WebRTCs most powerful API\n- RTCDataChannel: realtime communication of arbitrary data\n- integrating WebRTC with Web Audio\n- interoperability\n- security\n\nDuring the session, we talk through code examples, live demos and production apps.\n\nFor all I/O 2013 sessions, go to https://developers.google.com/live."
