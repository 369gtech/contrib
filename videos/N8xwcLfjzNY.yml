recordingDate: 1548238077
description: "Jacob Lister\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/244/\n\nJavascript JITs have come a long way in recent years, now offering near native code performance on the fly for many application types.\r\n\r\nWith the recent adoption on AudioWorklets, the browser is now becoming a viable platform for real time audio processing.\r\n\r\nJacob will be presenting Noisefloor, a proof of concept software Module Synthesizer implemented in Golang and transpiled to Javascript,\r\nand discussing some of the challenges involved in managing a reliable real time audio thread alongside a browser based UI.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
