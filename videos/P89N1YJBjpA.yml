description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM SF 19 http://bit.ly/2T3Do0U\n\nGet involved in Code Sync's next conference http://bit.ly/2Mcm4aS\n\n---\n\nZENMONITOR: SCALING DISTRIBUTED MONITORING AT DISCORD\nby Matthew Nowack\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nScaling \nDistributed \nMonitoring\n\nTALK LEVEL: Intermediate\n\nABSTRACT\nDiscord uses BEAM to power real-time communication between tens of millions of processes across dozens of servers.  Running a full-mesh network at this scale presents unique challenges when scaling out the native monitoring capabilities of the BEAM VM.\n\nLearn about ZenMonitor a new library developed at Discord which acts as a highly scalable drop-in replacement for process monitoring that reduces network traffic, improves reliability, and retains the core guarantees of BEAM.\n\nRead the full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/matthew-nowack/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - MATTHEW NOWACK\nScaled the Twilio API to 99.999% uptime and 99.99999% success rate serving billions of requests per week.  Now hard at work scaling the real-time communications infrastructure that powers Discord.\n\nMatt Nowack has spent a career working on scaling distributed systems.  From Twilio's REST API to Discord's Real-Time Communications Infrastructure, Matt is passionate about building and scaling high-quality low-latency distributed systems.\n\nMore on Matthew Nowack: https://codesync.global/speaker/matthew-nowack/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM SF 19\nCode BEAM SF is powered by Code Sync.
