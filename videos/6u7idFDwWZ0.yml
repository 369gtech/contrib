title: 'Structure your data in a natural way - Tobias Lindaaker'
recordingDate: 1423756965
description: "First - Structure your data in a natural way.\nData on its own is pointless. What matters is the information and intelligence that is derived from it. How easy it is to derive such understandings from data depends on how the data is structured.\nWhen learning new things, we form an understanding of it by relating it to things we already know. Structuring your data by how things are connected will give you a better understanding of your information, and help you create a better experience for your users.\nTobias Lindaaker is a software engineer and technical mentor at Neo Technology. Tobias has several years of experience with structuring, modelling and storing data, as well as retrieving data, and making sense of it.\n\n\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry in the Malmö/Lund region. Foo Café is aimed at those interested in sharing, learning and creating. \nJoin the fun at foocafe.org"
