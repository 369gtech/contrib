title: 'Kotlin Coroutines - threads and communication by Bob Dahlberg'
recordingDate: 1581884624
description: "As the async and possibly parallel programming becomes easier, the risk of sharing mutable variables between coroutines arises.\n\nWhen the boundaries are abstracted away, we should rely on safe ways to communicate between our coroutines. In this session, I will show how coroutines work with threads and both safe and unsafe forms of communication using coroutines.\n\nBob Dahlberg\nQvik\n\nRecorded at Jfokus 2020 in Stockholm 4th of february\nhttp://www.jfokus.se"
