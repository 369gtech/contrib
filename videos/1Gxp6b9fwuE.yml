title: 'Back to the Future: Containerize Legacy Applications'
language: English
recordingDate: 1509726866
description: 'People typically think of Docker for microservices and try to make the smallest container they can. There are tremendous benefits to a microservices model but those are not the only apps that qualify for containers. Traditional, homegrown, monolithic apps are also great candidates for Docker - why? By containerizing these apps, many of the same agility, portability, security and cost savings benefits can be applied to the hundreds (if not thousands) of apps in your datacenters. But where to begin? Attend this session to learn how to approach modernizing traditional apps (MTA), considerations, the available tools and possibilities.'
