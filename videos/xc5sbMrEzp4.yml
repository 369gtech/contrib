language: English
recordingDate: 1633502764
description: 'Data science project teams face a variety of challenges. While acquiring, exploring, and preparing data and then developing machine learning models are a significant part of these challenges, the value of models is often realized only when put into production. With Oracle Machine Learning and Oracle Autonomous Database, users have a range of options for building and deploying models, whether they use in-database algorithms or open source Python algorithms. Join us for this session to understand how Oracle Autonomous Database and the Oracle Machine Learning product family can streamline model creation and deployment.'
