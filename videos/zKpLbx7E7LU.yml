description: "Playing in the advertising field is difficult, the competition is fierce. Especially with digital roots, where knowledge gets obsolete day by day. But Mito got to the top of the game from a 3 people digital agency in 2008 evolving into a 160 people ad agency superseding all of our independent and most of our network agency competitors. \r\n\r\nWe believe that the key to this success in our field is having the greatest team ever. And we guess not just in our field. What makes a team dedicated and extraordinary? \r\n\r\nKnowledge. \r\n\r\nKnowledge in our field of expertise that makes us the most professional ad agency and knowledge about each other that truly makes us friends, not just colleagues. \r\n\r\nLet us show you some tips, tricks and tools how we ensure continuous learning on different levels within the team: \r\nMito Academy, Intro, UXversity, Mito Studio, Mito Labs, 4-hour playtime, Tabletop Thursdays, thematic Mito Breakfasts, Mr. Mito election, Mito Band, Mito Pickled Cucumber competition, Mito Cards - Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/stretch"
