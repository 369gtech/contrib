description: "Slides: https://speakerdeck.com/istanbultechtalks/itt-2014-mario-zechner-libgdx-101\n\nConsider this talk a 45 minute boot camp about libgdx. Mario will introduce you to the overall idea behind libgdx, show you how to create your first project, run and debug it on all supported platforms and introduce the bare minimum of libgdx's API to write a very simple game. After attending the talk you should be well equipped to dive into the documentation and samples of libgdx to start writting your first game!"
