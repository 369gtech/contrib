description: "Presented at Abstractions II, a software conference Code & Supply in Pittsburgh, PA August 21-23, 2019. Learn more at http://www.codeandsupply.co or https://abstractions.io. \n\nThe RAW CUTS series is comprised of selections from a few of our stages wherein the raw video was of high enough quality for C&S to release it before post-production. \n\nPost-production for a community-run conference with as many speakers and as low of a budget as Abstractions is an enormous and time-consuming undertaking. If you're interested in volunteering your time and CPU cycles to help with post-production, we can use your help. Email us at support@codeandsupply.co and we'll get you into the mix. You'll be permitted to credit yourself in the video pre-roll and credits and we'll thank you in this text and on social media.\n\nInterested in sponsoring professional post-production costs in exchange for your company's name and logo in the video forevermore? Contact us at sponsorship@abstractions.io. Opportunities start at $1,000.\n\n----\n\nWhen it comes to sextech, people often let their imaginations get in the way of the facts. One common reason is that the media likes to focus primarily on VR porn and bang-able robots. In reality these subjects are just a small uncommon sliver on the sextech spectrum. Sextech spans everything from menopause technology and sex-ed apps for teens to teledildonics and erotica audiobooks.\n\nYou encounter it when you use an app to track your menstrual cycle, talk to an A.I. OBGYN chatbot, or simply just watch pornography.\n\nIn this talk I'll describe:\n\n• briefly what sextech is\n\n• the current biases sextech faces and how they detrimentally impact marginalized groups, lead to sexual abuse and stifle innovation within the industry\n\n• why sextech is the most lucrative sector of technology based on growth statistics, use-cases and the human experience.\n\n• why adding “tech\" to the end of “sex” gives us “permission” to start dialogue on a taboo topic. The tech sector is uniquely positioned to remove the stigma surrounding one of the most common human experiences, and this is important for eliminating the professional risk associated with working in sextech. Technology enables bright minds to come forward and provide real world solutions to things like human trafficking, STIs, sexual assault, sex-ed, and more.\n\n• why being informed on the subject will make you a more well-rounded inclusive technologist and advocate for a more diverse tech industry\n\nhttps://abstractions.io/schedule/#Sextech:%20The%20Good,%20the%20Bad%20&%20the%20Bias-Alison%20Falk"
