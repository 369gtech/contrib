language: English
recordingDate: 1478870250
description: "Across is a Java framework that aims to facilitate module based development using Spring framework, without having to go OSGi.\n\nIn this session we'll do some live coding by building a simple web application from scratch. We'll touch on core features like development mode, module dependencies and installers. We'll build up from the AcrossWebModule but showcase some other standard modules along the way. You'll see how modules can be a big productivity gain while still retaining the flexibility of custom Spring based web development.\n\nApart from Across itself, the main technologies dropping by will be Spring MVC, Spring Data, Spring Boot, Thymeleaf and a bit of Bootstrap/JQuery on the side.\n\nArne Vandamme is founder of Foreach, an Antwerp based web plaform builder. More than 10+ years in web development using .NET, PHP and Java. Open source enthusiast and creator of Cucumber Web Bridge and Across framework.\n\n[HQE-5922]"
