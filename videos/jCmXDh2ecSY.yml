description: "What is it that makes writing secure software so difficult? Why do we keep making the same mistakes over and over again? One challenge is that developers are busy delivering features and meeting deadlines – giving security requirements less priority.\n\nIn this talk you’ll learn to use principles and mindsets from Domain Driven Design combined with a pinch of security awareness, to create secure code – while still focusing on your business features.\n\nYou’ll learn the basic principles of Secure by Design and how to use concepts such as Domain Primitives and Entity Snapshots to harden your code. What a Domain DoS attack is, and how to incorporate security testing in your delivery pipeline. The ideas and tools presented are directly applicable in your daily work.\n\nDaniel Sawano\nDeveloper, architect, public speaker, and agile dude. Long-time builder of high-performance systems with a background in stock trading and gaming. Master of science and a Java programmer for 15+ years. Loves creativity, beautiful software, DDD, TDD/BDD and a whole bunch of other acronyms. Passionate about cloud computing, agile methodologies, and creating systems that are secure by design. Daniel spends most of his days as a senior software engineer at Avanza Bank.\n\nDaniel Deogun is a Coder and Quality Defender who brings order to a chaotic world of bits and bytes using good design and clean code. He fights security issues on a daily basis using magic spells from DDD and an overall security mindset. In his spare time, Daniel coauthors the book Secure by Design. As a developer, Daniel started to play with Java in 1997 and his extensive experience ranges from patient critical pacemaker systems to web applications to high performant software in the gaming industry. Combining this with his passion for teaching have made him a frequent speaker at international conferences. Daniel is currently a senior consultant at Omegapoint in Stockholm, Sweden."
