description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM STO 19 http://bit.ly/2W2vgDC\n\nGet involved in Code Sync's next conference http://bit.ly/2Mcm4aS\n\n---\n\nEVOLUTION OF RIAK - DISCOVERING AND RESOLVING PROBLEMS IN DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS\nby Martin Sumner\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nRiak\nDecade\nDatabase\n\nTALK LEVEL: Intermediate \n\nABSTRACT\nThis talk will cover some problems of building a distributed system framework:\n\n- Mass adoption of scale-out with difficult developer trade-offs is hard to achieve;\n- The problems of testing claims of correctness;\n- Replication of activity and the impact on throughput, and replication of data can itself be a cause of data loss;\n- Non-conformity of performance between nodes is very difficult to manage (one slow node).\n\nHow the Riak framework is evolving to solve these problems:\n\n- Through the power of open source, and the capability to manage with small numbers of contributors spread globally, whilst better leveraging the BEAM eco-system to get progress for \"free\";\n- Through extended use of property-based testing;\n- Through increased specialisation of sub-components to always do \"just enough\" work, with better alignment between local storage layout and overall database features;\n- Through reactive work distribution, and minimisation of scheduled background tasks.\n\nRead the full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/martin-sumner/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - MARTIN SUMNER\nWorked long enough in networks, to always blame the application\n\n\nMartin was the technical lead on one of the largest (by volume) public sector systems in Europe - the UK National Health Service Spine II. The architecture of this was inspired by Erlang, and the Actor Model - and Spine II has maintained 5 nines availability since its go-live in 2014. Spine II is a big user of Riak, and for the past 3 years Martin has worked full-time on developing and maintaining the open-source Riak project - learning to love Erlang and the BEAM in the process.\n\nMore on Martin Sumner: https://codesync.global/speaker/martin-sumner/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM STO 19\nCode BEAM STO is powered by Code Sync.
