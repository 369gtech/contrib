description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nKubernetes on Edge: Bringing Your Code to Constrained Places - Steven Wong, VMware; Dejan Bosanac, Red Hat; Kilton Hopkins, Edgeworx\n\nThe main goal of IoT and edge solutions is to bring the workloads closer to sources of data, events and transactions. In many cases this means maintaining them in places with network and compute resource constraints. This session will cover technologies and best practices available to achieve this goal. We will start by covering some common challenges of creating IoT edge workloads. We’ll discuss pros and cons of using traditional containers versus upcoming technologies such as WebAssembly and WASI. Next, we’ll explore mechanisms of deploying built artifacts to the actual hardware, ranging from using different Kubernetes deployments, to simpler container runtimes and specialized Edge platforms. We’ll also focus on the evolving state of running WebAssembly workloads using Kubernetes and how to apply best practices to IoT and edge use cases. We’ll try to provide general guidance on how to choose the best approach for your project with a practical demo of one of the possible solutions."
