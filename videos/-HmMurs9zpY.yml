The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects - Learn more at https://kubecon.io\n\nStory of a Kubernetes Go Operator - Aravind Putrevu, Elastic \n\nKubernetes is the undisputed leader in container orchestration world. But simply running all sorts of applications on Kubernetes are not so easy. The Operator Framework is an open source project that provides developer and runtime Kubernetes tools, enabling you to accelerate the development of an Operator. Operators are purpose-built to run a Kubernetes application, with operational knowledge baked in. They will be smarter and more tailored than generic tools. The cloud-like capabilities that are encoded into the Operator code can provide an advanced user experience, automating such features as updates, backups and scaling. All of this is accomplished using standard K8s tools, CLI and API. Elasticsearch is one of the most downloaded and used container on docker hub. This talk explains our journey and thoughts in writing a GoLang based operator for Elasticsearch. \n\nhttps://sched.co/YWJT"
