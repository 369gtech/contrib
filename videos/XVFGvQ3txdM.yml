title: 'JDK IO 2017 - Yegor Bugayenko - Java Annotations Are a Bad Idea'
recordingDate: 1510512576
description: 'Annotations were introduced in Java 5, and we all got excited. Such a great instrument to make code shorter! No more Hibernate/Spring XML configuration files! Just annotations, right there in the code where we need them. No more marker interfaces, just a runtime-retained reflection-discoverable annotation! I was excited too. Moreover, I''ve made a few open source libraries which use annotations heavily. Take jcabi-aspects, for example. However, I''m not excited any more. Moreover, I believe that annotations are a big mistake in Java design.'
