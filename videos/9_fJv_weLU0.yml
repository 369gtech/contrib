title: 'DEF CON 29 Adversary Village - Carlos Polop - New Generation of PEAS'
language: English
recordingDate: 1629143895
description: "Local privilege escalation techniques are far beyond checking the Windows/Kernel version, looking for unquoted service paths or checking SUID binaries. Moreover, a local privilege escalation could make a huge difference when trying to comprise a domain. Several tools have been created to find possible privilege escalation paths, but most of the tools for Red Team and Pentesting just check for a few possible ways, so pentesters need to use several tools and do some manual recon to check for everything.\n\nPEASS is a compilation of a bash script for Linux/MacOS/*nix and a .Net project and a batch script for Windows that I have created some time ago which aims to check and highlight every possible privescpath so professionals donâ€™t need to execute several different tools for this purpose and can very easily find vulnerabilities.\n\nDuring this talk I would like to present PEASS-ng. The architecture of these scripts has evolved and improved so much that I would like to present how they work at the moment and how the difficulty to collaborate with the project has been reduced significantly. Moreover, I would also like to present the 2 new PEAS that haven't been present anywhere yet: BotPEAS and WebPEAS (the latest one will be released the day of the talk). During the talk I will also present my local privilege escalation resources (https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-unix/privilege-escalation , https://book.hacktricks.xyz/windows/windows-local-privilege-escalation) so the attended will be able to continue learning about the topic after the talk."
