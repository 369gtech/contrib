description: "Speaker: Arseny Chernov\r\n\r\nDuring this demonstration-driven talk, you'll learn reference architectures for data engineering, data science and machine learning use-cases powered by Apache Spark on AWS. The talk will cover following AWS services: Sagemaker, Glue, Athena, Redshift and RDS, ephemeral EC2 spot, on-demand instances. The demo rely on a regular AWS account in our local preferred region ( ap-southeast-1 ) with an existing VPC that has data sources that Apache Spark will integrate with. As a follow-up to this demo, you might be able to repeat the same steps in your own AWS Accounts.\r\n\r\nArseny Chernov, joined Databricks in 2018, and is APJ leader for Partner Solutions Architecture, based out of Singapore.\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/Spark-Singapore/events/266042327/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/CHIpK/"
