description: "The worst advice Pearl got as a junior developer was to keep her head down and her hard work would speak for itself. Wrong! If you want that promotion, to get asked for exciting new opportunities, and perhaps even gain a little bit of fame, you need to toot your own horn.\n\nSelling yourself does not have to feel icky or manipulative. In fact, selling yourself as a developer is simply about sharing what’s already in your head, what you have already done, what you’re currently learning, and what you’re passionate about. It can be as easy as tweeting or starting a blog.\n\nPearl Chen\nhttps://twitter.com/PearlChen\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc\n\nSave 10% off any FITC event with discount code 'youtube'.\nSee our upcoming events at www.fitc.ca"
