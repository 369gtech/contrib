description: "Domain-Driven Design Europe 2018\nhttps://dddeurope.com/\nhttps://twitter.com/ddd_eu\n\nDistill the Core Domain from Your Legacy App\n\nLet's take a very common legacy application: procedural code everywhere, anemic domain logic fully entangled with technical concerns and code. Nothing but classical stuff, right? Our mission for this truly interactive live-coding session will be to identify and extract the core domain logic out of this tar pit in order to add a new feature that has been desperately asked by our business since months.\n\nLast but not least, we will clean the situation for the years to come by properly splitting the domain code from the technical one using the Hexagonal Architecture pattern. Ready to help us in that journey?\n\nBIOGRAPHY\n\nCo-organizer of the DDD Paris user group, Thomas is an eXtreme Programmer & technical architect obsessed by use cases (Vs. solution-driven approaches). He likes using DDD & TDD to boost his efficiency at work. Advocating the advantages of the Hexagonal architecture since many years (talks, blogposts...), Thomas has recently live-coded with Alistair Cockburn on that topic.\n\nHis company 42skillz which aims to help organizations to make software and to work differently, he provides trainings, coaching, consulting about TDD, BDD, legacy code refactoring techniques and DDD with an extra soul.\n\nBruno is developer, trainer, agile coach and speaker. He loves to explain with concrete examples with live-coding, if needed. He is a long-time Microsoft MVP, but he still is coding java with a C# accent ;-)\n\nHis company 42skillz which aims to help organizations to make software and to work differently, he provides trainings, coaching, consulting about TDD, BDD, legacy code refactoring techniques and DDD with an extra soul."
