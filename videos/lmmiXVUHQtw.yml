title: 'Talking crypto with developers'
recordingDate: 1603953894
description: "On the surface, implementing encryption looks simple enough. Scratch a bit and strange concepts and far-fetched requirements will emerge. Encryption is very easy to add, and thus very easy to get wrong. What is really complicated, is to get it right.\n\nThis straight talk on how to use encryption when coding will guide you through all the essential details. No pre-knowledge required, but an interest in getting it right when protecting data form malicious actors is greatly appreciated.\n___________________________\nFoo Café is a meeting place for people with an interest in software development and IT. \nHere, user groups and partner companies find the perfect atmosphere for sharing knowledge and develop competence. \nFoo Café is open for everyone and is free to attend.
