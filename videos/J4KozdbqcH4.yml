description: "MiniBox: A Two-Way Sandbox for x86 Native Code\n\nYanlin Li, CyLab/Carnegie Mellon University; Jonathan McCune and James Newsome, CyLab/Carnegie Mellon University and Google, Inc.; Adrian Perrig, CyLab/Carnegie Mellon University; Brandon Baker and Will Drewry, Google, Inc.\n\nThis paper presents MiniBox, the first two-way sandbox for x86 native code, that not only protects a benign OS from a misbehaving application, but also protects an application from a malicious OS. MiniBox can be applied in Platform-as-a-Service cloud computing to provide two-way protection between a customerâ€™s application and the cloud platform OS. We implement a Mini- Box prototype running on recent x86 multi-core systems from Intel or AMD, and we port several applications to MiniBox. Evaluation results show that MiniBox is efficient and practical.\n\nView the full USENIX ATC '14 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc14/technical-sessions"
