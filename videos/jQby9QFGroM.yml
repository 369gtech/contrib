description: "IoT is about connecting Internet-enabled devices that relay information back to us, to cloud-based applications and to each other (device to device). In this talk, I will discuss best practices and show how to efficiently build IoT apps on AWS, including the use of voice interfaces. I will also showcase the latest AWS IoT Device called DeepLens (https://aws.amazon.com/deeplens/) and build a machine learning project using Amazon SageMaker to build and train model and deploy it at the edge on the AWS DeepLens device.\n\nAdrian Hornsby, Amazon Web Services\nHalf French/English living in Finland for 15 years, climber, musician, amateur photograph, all this wrapped together in a Technical Evangelist working for AWS and passionate about everything cloud.
