description: "Bret McGowen walks through several features of the Google Cloud Platform while showing off a demo built to display a frozen-in-time 180 degree video.The demo uses an orchestrated set of smartphones to capture multi-angle views of the same event, upload them to the cloud and have them stitched together in real time to create a single 180-degree snapshot of that moment. \n\nSee sample videos on the Google Cloud Spin Twitter account at https://twitter.com/googlecloudspin\n\nWatch more talks from Ubiquity Dev Summit here: https://goo.gl/FS9v3U\n\nSubscribe to the Google Developers channel at http://goo.gl/mQyv5L\n\nMusic by Terra Monk: http://terramonk.com/"
