description: 'The battle for supremacy for the control of the dashboard display or infotainment systems has always been a race. Most of these systems run on Linux, Android, Windows (customized dashboards - perhaps Windows ME or CE) and Blackberry''s QNX. In-Vehicle Infotainment (IVI) or In-car entertainment (ICE) Systems are indeed fun consoles where you can play media, movies, or work with your car''s navigational system. But somehow it also comes with a risk of being hacked or attacked because they have also been plagued with vulnerabilities. In this talk, join Jay as he presents his own Car Hacker''s Methodology in finding security bugs in order to pwn a car''s infotainment system without having to do a drive by wire or CANbus hacking tools but will simply point out the common attack surfaces e.g WiFi, Bluetooth, USB Ports, etc. and some scenarios on how to exploit it just like how he popped a shell or issue an arbitrary command in his car which he tweeted in Twitter before.'
