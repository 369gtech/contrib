title: 'Six Reasons to Use a Repository Manager Now'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433515475
description: "You really don’t realize how much you need a repository manager until after you start using one, and this session makes the case that repositories are essential to Java developers. Stop throwing source code over a wall and then training your operations team to run  the build  as a part of your deployment process. Use a CI system such as Jenkins or Bamboo, and push your releases into Artifactory, Nexus, or Archiva. The presentation explores these three options and compares and contrasts the advantages of each from a vendor-neutral perspective. You will leave this session with a deep understanding of how repository managers make development and deployment easier, and you will also understand how to start incorporating one today.\n\n\nAuthor:\nTim OBrien\nTim has authored and co-authored a number of books for O’Reilly including: Maven: The Definitive Guide, The Jakarta Commons Cookbook, Maven: A Developer’s Notebook, and Harnessing Hibernate.
