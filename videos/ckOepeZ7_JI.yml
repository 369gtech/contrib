description: "Nowadays, containers are more than a cool new tool to play with - they've revolutionized the way we develop, architect and ship software and have become part of our day-to-day operations. On the other hand, Java has been around for more than 2 decades, dominating the entreprise world. Both advocate the \"RUN anywhere\" principal, but, is it that easy? No! Your perfect working local container will most probably fail on production because of MEMORY &/or CPU issues, since jvm apps assume they OWN the server they are running on. This session will look at the gotchas of running JVM apps in containers & how to avoid costly pitfalls. We will cover:\n\nWhat updates recent versions of Java brought to the table to improve container awareness and the issues related to prior versions, including how to address each one of them to avoid the mess.\n\nTips and tricks to obtain smaller images & best practices while writing your DockerFiles\n\nSome plugins to helps non-containers experts integrate docker in their development process; and\n\nThe concept of \"Distroless\" Docker Images and how to benefit from it.\n\nMohammed Aboullaite\nxHub\n\nRecorded at Jfokus 2020 in Stockholm 5th of february\nhttp://www.jfokus.se"
