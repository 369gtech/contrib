description: "Have you asked yourself, “What is Spring and what does it do?”  Well, this talk is for you! We’ll begin with a brief history of Spring Framework. From there, we’ll discuss the layers of Spring and what each layer does. As we cover each layer, we’ll give an overview on the key projects that comprise the layer.\n\nGlenn Renfro, Software Developer at VMware\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/what-is-spring"
