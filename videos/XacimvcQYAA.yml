description: "Slides: https://www.slideshare.net/7of9/from-responsive-to-anticipatory\n\nIn the era of connected devices we are dealing with an ever increasing amount of different data. In most cases \"Dumb Data\". Most interfaces we use today just react to actions taken in the present, without utilizing the data available to predict future needs, creating anticipatory experiences.\n\nSome companies, like Google (Nest, Google Now) or Amazon (anticipatory shipping, Echo) have recognized the value of anticipation early on, others are following suit.\n\nPro-active applications can certainly contribute to a better user experience, but they also may cause the user to feel uncomfortable. Hence, answering the following questions is of paramount importance: How to create relevance, without being uncanny? How to support the user without patronizing him and how to avoid frustration resulting from false or inaccurate anticipation.\n\nAbout Agnieszka: http://walorska.net/\nAbout Mobilism: https://mobilism.nl/\n\nVideography generously sponsored by BÃ©yonit: https://www.beyonit.nl/"
