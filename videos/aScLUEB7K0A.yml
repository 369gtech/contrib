description: 'This presentation will try to answer the burning question: can emerging technologies and architectures make you a superhero? Or, more practically, what''s actually working now in real world situations, and how that can make a difference for you. For example, we find that in machine learning systems, the learning is only a small part of what is needed - data engineering is the larger part. I will also delve into what we see in changing data practices, technologies that support effective streaming micro-services, strategies for a uniform computing environment in hybrid cloud/multi-cloud systems, and how to get ready for what''s coming next.'
