title: 'Webinar: Brigade: Scripting Container Workflows on Kubernetes'
language: English
recordingDate: 1572300136
description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nBrigade is an in-cluster runtime that interprets scripts and executes generic pipelines of work in Kubernetes. Using JavaScript, developers can chain containers together in a script to create an event-driven workflow in Kubernetes. Scripts can define a series of jobs that run in parallel or serially, and take advantage of having full programming language support for error handling and async functionality, as well as benefit from the rich JavaScript ecosystem of libraries.\n\nBrigade is a CNCF Sandbox project, it integrates with other cloud-native projects (Helm, Prometheus, CloudEvents, Virtual Kubelet), and has varied use cases (from a foundation for opinionated CI/CD platforms, to building training pipelines for predictive modeling, or asynchronous processing for orders).\n\nIn this webinar we will explore how to start building distributed workflows in Kubernetes using a few lines of code, how Brigade works, and how it integrates with the cloud native ecosystem."
