recordingDate: 1526134458
description: "Speaker: Douglas Blank\n\nProject Jupyter is the center of a set of technologies that grew out of simple tools to make Python easier to use. Today, Jupyter is composed of powerful client-server applications and protocols for computing in many programming languages. This talk focuses on using these technologies for pedagogical purposes. \n\nEvery course I have taught since the Fall semester of 2014 has been over the web via our JupyterHub server. These courses have included firstyear writing seminars, as well as courses in Programming Languages, Assembly Language, Introduction to Biology (in Python), and in Processing (Java-based). In this talk I hope to help identify best-practices for using Jupyter in the classroom. I will discuss and demonstrate tools and techniques, and explore the challenges of using Jupyter for teaching and learning.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2018 and https://github.com/PyCon/2018-slides"
