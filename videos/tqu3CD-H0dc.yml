description: "Регистрируйтесь на CodeFest: https://codefest.ru/\nНаш Телеграм-канал: https://t.me/cdfst\n\nConstraintLayout is a new layout for Android platform.\n\nSeems to be similar to RelativeLayout but has more cool features and some say that also better performance.\n\nIn my presentation I want to show how UI layouts used to be done on Android and what ConstraintLayout, a new kind on the block, brings to table to help build a responsive UI for Android.\n\nWe will also dig deep into ConstraintLayout itself to see how it actually works."
