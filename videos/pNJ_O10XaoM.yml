title: 'Not all equals methods are created equal by Jan Ouwens'
language: English
recordingDate: 1510048577
description: "Did you know your equals method can contain bugs, even if you have it generated by your IDE?\n\nI will show you how to recognise these potential bugs, and why you should care about them. You will see how to craft an ironclad equals method. Also, you will see how to test your equals method and gain 100% coverage with a single line of test code, using EqualsVerifier. Because testing equals shouldn't have to take pages of code.\n\n# Jan Ouwens\nJan Ouwens is a software developer from the Netherlands who has experience with a wide variety of languages, including Java, Ruby, Typescript, English and yes, even VBScript. He currently works as a Scala developer at CodeStar in the Netherlands. Jan is also the creator of EqualsVerifier, which probably makes him the only programmer who codes Scala during the day, and Java in his spare time."
