description: "RubyConf 2018 - Building a Memex (with Ruby!) Andrew Louisa\n\nIn 1945, the Memex was supposed to be the ultimate personal library. In addition to storing information, users could navigate, organize, link, and share data. But tragically, it was never built.\n\n73 years later, I’m building one in Ruby. I’ve created dozens of importers for different services I use, organized the 10M data points into a graph schema, and used Ruby to tie everything together. Almost all aspects of my life and personal history are now available through an API.\n\nI’ll go over the history of the Memex, how I used Ruby to build my own, and do a demo of what I can do with it."
