description: "When you learn a new language, like French or German or even English, you first learn how to read. Then you learn how to write. When you learn a new *programming* language, you first learn how to write. And that’s it.\n\nImagine that you were never formally taught how to read. And that you were told that you should just figure it out … by writing … a whole bunch. How would that even work? I don’t think it would.\n\nIf you can’t read. You can’t write. It’s that simple.\n\nDo you think that Shakespeare would be Shakespeare if he never read a single book in his entire life? No. Nothing is created in a vacuum. Good writers are good writers because they’re good readers.\n\n\nJust as reading is an invaluable skill so to is reading code. It’s a skill that’s never formally taught. But it’s a skill that is essential nonetheless. In this talk I’ll show you how to effectively read code so that might write better code.\n\n\nEVENT:\nEuroPython 2019\n\n\nSPEAKER:\nMax Humber\n\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed)\n\n\nATTRIBUTION CREDITS:\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BdveiyuAYQ\n\n\nINTERESTED IN STOCK MARKET:\nI developed a profitable market model for the US stock market: https://yuriymatso.com/my-market-model/"
