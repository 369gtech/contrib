description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nBindles Bundle but They Don't Fall Down: Aggregate Object Storage for Wasm - Matt Butcher, Microsoft Azure & Taylor Thomas, Cosmonic\n\nAs interest in WebAssembly (Wasm) continues to increase, a familiar problem has reared its head: how do we distribute and store these new applications? We have tried everything from tarballs, to OCI, to bespoke storage products. But Wasm has a unique characteristic – it enables you to build an application out of several completely different, but related parts. An \"application\" may be an aggregate of dozens of Wasm binaries. Enter Bindle, an aggregate object storage and Cloud Native Wasm packaging tool. In this talk, we will discuss why we created Bindle, including a deep dive into its strengths and weaknesses. We will also demo how this can be used to package an aggregate application and deploy it to a service, before finishing up with the future of the project and how you can help! Along the way, we'll talk about security, integrity, Merkle trees, caching, and trust."
