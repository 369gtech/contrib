description: "Building upon Project Reactor, Spring WebFlux, and Spring Boot 2.0, Spring Cloud Gateway offers Spring Cloud users an impressive set of features and functionality for cloud native applications. In comparison to Zuul from Spring Cloud Netflix, Spring Cloud Gateway provides a much more flexible API for configuring the edge service of your applications. In addition, functionality such as rate limiting, and websocket routing are supported out of the box. During this rapid fire 30 minute session we will introduce Spring Cloud Gateway and demonstrate its potential impact on your cloud applications.\n\nSpeakers:\nRyan Baxter\nSoftware Engineer, Pivotal\nCora Iberkleid\nSenior Platform Architect, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
