Can we actually qualify happiness with scientific notions instead of esoteric ones? How can happiness be useful? Are women happier than men? Is Montreal a happier metropolis than Quebec city? What can we learn from happiness? Brace yourself for Pierre Côté, the creator of the Relative Happiness Index, who is ready to answer all of these questions and more!\r\n\r\nSpeaker: Pierre Côté\r\nMarketing and communication senior consultant\r\nPresident and founder of the RHI (Relative Happiness Index)\r\nParticipant in the TV series Castaway Cities\r\nAuthor\r\n\r\nJoin us for this unique tech talk on The Relative Happiness Index (RHI), a unique social observatory tool\r\n\r\nA bold visionary and very sensitive to the social reality, Pierre Côté founded in 2006 the Relative Happiness Index. The main objective of this index is to develop from happiness a real and a scientific variable that will be useful to establish a judgment or to evaluate a society, a community or a group of people. \r\n\r\nAn independent social observatory tool, the Relative Happiness Index, through the forty inquiries realised since 2006, surveyed no less than 70 000 Quebecers by asking over 800 questions. \r\n\r\nThe Pierre Côté experience and his profound knowledge of Quebec's society acquired through the Relative Happiness Index makes him a unique consultant. As such, he's regularly invited by the media to share and explain the results of his researches and to comment on different aspects of society."
