description: "In this session, we will primarily focus on OpenWhisk, an open source FaaS (Function-as-a-Service) engine, layered on top of Kubernetes and integrating numerous cloud hosted and \"on-premise\" services. Serverless is a misnomer, your future cloud native applications will consist of both microservces and functions, often wrapped as Linux containers, but in many cases where you the developer ignore the operational aspects of managing that infrastructure.\n\nPresented by Rafael Benevides\n\nSubscribe to our channel: https://youtube.pl/c/DevoxxPoland?sub_confirmation=1\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DevoxxPL\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/grzegorz.duda.official/\n\nJoin us also here:\nTechnology Radar Review: https://dworld.pl/radar\nDevelopers World Academy: https://dworld.pl/akademia\nDevflix: https://devflix.pl\n\n#Devoxx #DevoxxPoland #IT #Development #SoftwareDevelopment"
