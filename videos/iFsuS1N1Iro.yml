description: "We are working on making Drupal 8 truly API-first: API-first initative.\n\nWe are:\n\nImproving Drupal 8's REST API, to become best-in-class.\nBringing JSON API support to Drupal 8 core (stable in contrib during 8.4.x, hopefully experimental in 8.5.0).\n… and there's so much more we'd like to see happen, such as: GraphQL, OAuth 2, UUID/revision support, CouchDB support.\nIn doing so, we need:\n\nfrustrations!\_to hear where Drupal 8's API-first support in core (and contrib) is currently failing, in terms of DX, capabilities, and so on.\nroadmap feedback. (We need to hear what you think is important and why.)\nhelp! We can provide mentoring: if you help out with patches, we'll provide reviews to help you land things in core!\nThis is an update of the sessions in Dublin & Baltimore.\n\nAt this core conversation:\n\nWe'll start with a succinct overview of what's going on, what has happened so far, and our long-term ambitions. Then we'll open the floor for discussion! When necessary, we'll explain subjects in more detail.\nYou don't need to be an expert in anything, just rudimentary knowledge about web services is sufficient.\nYou'll walk away knowing what's happening in the API-first initiative, and will hear about other attendees' concerns/thoughts/requirements/…."
