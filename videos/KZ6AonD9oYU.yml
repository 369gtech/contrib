description: "We learned a lot about the offline first concept in the past three years including Service Worker, CouchDB etc.\n\nDid we do everything already to make our applications offline first? Is caching the resources enough? Did we answer all the questions already and if not… What are the new questions we need to answer?\n\nIn this talk, I’ll show you what has changed in the last few years, how people did adapt the concept and what are the best practices.\n\nAnd most importantly, can offline first help to save lives?"
