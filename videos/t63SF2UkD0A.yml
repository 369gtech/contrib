description: "Over the last five years, the amount of data in our data centers has exploded, and today there are numerous NoSQL, streaming, and batch systems that promise to scale with your data. These new technologies bring with them a difficult question that needs to be answered: which tool is the best fit for my use case? This session looks at antipatterns in tools such as Hadoop, Spark, Cassandra, and Kafka and discusses picking the wrong tool for the job, how misconfiguration can counter your attempts to scale, and how even simple operations such as counts can break. Attendees will walk away from the session with a solid grasp of the strengths and weaknesses of various big data tools and will have learned which pitfalls to avoid when working with these tools.\n\nSpeaker:\nAlex Holmes, Software Engineer, Alex Holmes\nAlex Holmes is a software engineer, author, speaker and blogger.
