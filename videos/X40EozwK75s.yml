language: English
recordingDate: 1572989637
description: "This session dives deep into the architecture of Apache Kafka and how to use it in practice. Kafka offers a new take on publish/subscribe messaging that is very different from other messaging systems. But Kafka isn't just a messaging system - it's an event streaming platform.\n\nBecome an expert on Kafka concepts such as topic partitioning, consumer groups and exactly-once semantics. Find out best practices for using the APIs to achieve performance and reliability.\n\nLearn about advanced concepts such as stream processing using the Kafka Streams and integrating with other services using Kafka Connect.\n\nKatherine Stanley is a Software Engineer in the IBM Event Streams team based in the UK. Through her work on IBM Event Streams she has gained experience running Apache Kafka on Kubernetes and running enterprise Kafka applications. In her previous role she specialised in cloud native Java applications and microservices architectures. Katherine has co-authored an IBM Redbook on Java microservices and has contributed to the open source microservice project Game On. She enjoys sharing her experiences and has presented at conferences around the world, including the Kafka Summits in New York and London, JavaLand in Germany and JFokus in Sweden.\n\nAndrew Dunnings is a Software Developer in the IBM Event Streams team based in the UK. Andrew joined IBM as a graduate in 2017 and has developed expertise in running Apache Kafka on Kubernetes through his work on IBM Event Streams. He has experience introducing IBM customers to Apache Kafka and is keen to share his knowledge of both Kafka and Kubernetes with the developer community."
