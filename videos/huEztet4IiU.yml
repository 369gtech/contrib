description: "Scaling systems is hard. Scaling operations teams to manage those systems? Even harder. How do you find the ideal production-savvy engineer to support your systems end to end? Direct experience, technical skills, perfect culture fit - companies look for so many qualities in one person, it borders on myth. It's time to build a better unicorn and learn how to scale your teams for the real world.\n\nAbout Bethanye McKinney Blount (Facebook):\nBethanye McKinney Blount leads infrastructure teams managing some of the most complex systems at Facebook. Those teams build and manage the underlying systems infrastructure that allows all the engineering teams to build scalable, reliable services. She is passionate about developing women in tech, from participating in diversity initiatives at Facebook to mentoring female startup founders.\n\nPreviously, she was Engineering Director at Linden Lab (makers of Second Life) where her teams were responsible for all customer-facing products.
