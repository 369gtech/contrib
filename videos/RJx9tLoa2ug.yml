description: "Not Only for Giants: The Minimal Reasonable Size of a Cloud Foundry Implementation - Juan Pablo Genovese, Altoros\n\nAllstate, EMC, HP, IBM, GE... All of them are giants in their respective industries. Sometimes, it looks like Cloud Foundry is destined to only work for the big guys. The size of a typical deployment alone can be quite intimidating. However, there are very compelling reasons and very specific ways for a small/medium sized business to adopt Cloud Foundry as a cloud platform to manage their software products and implementations. In this presentation, Juan Pablo Genovese will demonstrate the smallest and cheapest possible way to deploy Cloud Foundry, achieving an affordable solution for in-house Cloud Foundry management. He will go over different IaaS options, a sample BOSH manifest, and how to make the most of Cloud Foundry for a small/medium sized company. This will help companies that think Cloud Foundry is \"too complicated\" to look at this awesome product in a different way.\n\nAbout Juan Pablo Genovese\nAll and Everything Cloud Foundry. Tango. Beers. Blues. :)"
