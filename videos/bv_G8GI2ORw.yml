description: "Laziness is one of Larry Wall’s “three great virtues of a programmer”, but most people probably don’t consider it a virtue when writing tests! Wouldn’t it be great though, if we could write a program that generates our tests for us? As it turns out, we can and should do this using property-based testing.\n\nI’ll go through some example testing scenarios in a few popular programming languages, aiming to demonstrate:\n\n* What property-based testing is and why EVERYONE should be using it (not just people coding in functional languages!)\n* How generators can quickly & easily come up with more thorough test inputs than a programmer typing in magic numbers\n* How to (and how not to) define properties to specify program behaviour\n* The genius of shrinkers and why they can save you hours of tedious debugging and questioning your life choices\n* Attendees will gain a solid & practical understanding of how they can apply property-based testing to their own code, in fashion that is both enjoyable and lucrative.\n\nSam has an extensive background leading small, focused teams building in-house business systems in .NET, and has concentrated on cloud & mobile solutions for the last five years. He’s been an Apple fanboy since the 80s, was coding in Objective-C before it was cool, and Swift was his favourite language before he’d written a single line.\n\nIn his spare time he likes to start projects he’s never going to finish, most of them involving one or more of iOS, CouchDB, LevelDB, F#, Haskell, and Arduino.\n\nFor more on YOW!
