description: "PyData DC 2018 \n\nThose of us who use TensorFlow often focus on building the model that's most predictive, not the one that's most deployable. So how to put that hard work to work? In this talk, we'll walk through a strategy for taking your machine learning models from Jupyter Notebook into production and beyond.\n\nSlides - https://www.slideshare.net/PyData/restful-machine-learning-with-flask-and-tensorflow-serving-carlo-mazzaferro\n===\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
