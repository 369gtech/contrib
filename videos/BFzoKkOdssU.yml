description: "Code Mesh London is the best place in Europe for non-mainstream tech and programming languages. On 4-5 December 2013 over 50 inventors and originators of the most innovative languages and technologies of the moment shared their experience with 200 attendees. Topics included Scala, Haskell, Clojure, Erlang, Elixir, Julia and much more. See you at Code Mesh 2014! codemesh.io/\n\nAbout the talk:\nC# is starting to gain a lot of traction as a game development language, perhaps because of the balance that it strikes between efficiency and performance or perhaps because it is the best option in Unity3D. At the same time, building a modern game is a complicated undertaking, requiring many different aspects of programming, from algorithm design to higher level architectures to directly driving the hardware. As software developers, we need to use the most efficient languages coupled with strong base frameworks to make the prospect of building a game financially viable.\nIn this talk, the attendee will gain in-depth understanding of some of the aspects of C# that lend themselves particularly well to game development. They will learn how to twist the enumerator pattern to build a co-routine subsystem,and how to isolate and multi-thread expensive operations using the Task Parallel Library. As well as what features of the language not to use."
