title: 'Serverless with Azure Functions - Simon J.K. Pedersen'
recordingDate: 1505133183
description: "Come learn about how to go serverless with Microsoft Azure Functions and .NET. Serverless has been quite hyped, but how is it really done in practice, what is the advantages and what do you need to be aware of when using Azure Functions. \n\nThe meetup will require no prior knowledge of Azure, and even though Azure Function also supports other languages (like Node.js, Python, PHP, batch, bash, or any executable ) the examples given will be done in C#.\n\nSimon J.K. Pedersen is working as a Azure Architect/Developer at Delegate A/S a Microsoft consulting company based in Copenhagen. He has been working with .NET for the past 10 years, the last 5 primarily with focus on leveraging Azure Services in .NET applications. \n\nHe is the author of the Letsencrypt site-extension for Azure web apps, that allows easy installation of free Letsencrypt SSL certificates on Azure. Simon is also partner and CTO in the startup tiimo, which runs their entire infrastructure in Azure. Tiimo is an icon based app for smart watches which supports children that benefit from having structure in their everyday lives.\n___________________________\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry in the Malmö/Lund region.
