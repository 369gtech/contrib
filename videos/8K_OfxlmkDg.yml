description: "Fred Moyer, Circonus\n\nOperating containerized infrastructure brings with it a new set of challenges. How do you instrument containers? How do you evaluate API endpoint performance? How do you identify bad actors in your infrastructure?\n\nThe Istio service mesh enables instrumentation of APIs without code change. Istio provides service latencies for free; how can you make sense all that data? With math, that’s how. I will demonstrate use of mathematical techniques to ask and answer business queries. I’ll show how to create RED (Rate, Errors, Duration) dashboards that provide insight into API performance; they are essential for meeting service level objectives. And how to monitor at scale cost effectively with histograms, which preserve metric fidelity and enable statistical analysis.\n\nThis talk is targeted at K8s developers and SREs who are faced with the challenge of reporting to business decision makers. Attendees will come away with the know how to be able to answer the questions posed in this description, an understanding of their infrastructure performance, and the ability to determine if they are under or over provisioned.\n\nView the full SREcon18 Asia/Australia Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon18asia/program\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
