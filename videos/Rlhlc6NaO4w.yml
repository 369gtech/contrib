description: "Filmed at https://2019.dotswift.io on January 28th in Paris. More talks on https://dotconferences.com/talks\n\nSwiftNIO is a cross-platform asynchronous event-driven network application framework for rapid development of high performance protocol servers & clients. SwiftNIO was first introduced in Feb 2018, and included basic protocols such as tcp, udp and http. Tom explores when you would want to implement your own custom protocol, such as JSON-RPC, and review how you could use SwiftNIO to do so."
