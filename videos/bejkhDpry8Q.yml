description: "Hey gang, in this jQuery tutorial for beginners, I'll show you how to bind and unbind events using jQuery. Events are at the heart of all modern web applications, and mastering them is essential to being a good front-end developer. \n\nIn this jQuery tutorial, we'll take a look at two methods - on() and off(). The former binds events to matched elements and the latter unbinds events from the matched elements.\n\nLink to jQuery events - http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_ref_events.asp\n\nAny questions, ask below :)\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO CHANNEL - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n========== JavaScript for Beginners Playlist ==========\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9i9Ae2D9Ee1RvylH38dKuET\n\n========== CSS for Beginners Playlist ==========\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gQeDH6xYhmO-db2mhoTSrT\n\n========== HTML for Beginners Playlist ==========\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9ibZ2TSBaGGNrgh4ZgYE6Cc\n\n========== The Net Ninja ============\n\nFor more front-end development tutorials & to black-belt your coding skills, head over to - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg or http://thenetninja.co.uk\n\n========== Social Links ==========\n\nTwitter - @TheNetNinja - https://twitter.com/thenetninjauk"
