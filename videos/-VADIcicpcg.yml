description: "We’re so pleased to announce that we’ve teamed up with Dave Farley, author of “Continuous Delivery” and frequent GOTO Conferences speaker, for a monthly video series featuring ideas about continuous delivery, DevOps, test-driven development, BDD, software engineering and software development in general. \n\nFind plenty more from Dave on his Continuous Delivery YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCfqyGl3nq_V0bo64CjZh8g\n\nDave Farley - Continuous Delivery & DevOps Pioneer, Award-winning Author, Founder & Director of Continuous Delivery Ltd.\n\nABSTRACT\nObject-Oriented Programming has been the dominant approach for the past couple of decades, but Functional programming languages are growing in popularity and influence. So is OO programming outdated? Is Functional programming a fashion that simply misses the point?\n\nMany Functional programmers think that Object Oriented programming is bad. Many OO programmers think that Functional Programming is not scalable, what is the truth?\n\nIn this episode, Dave Farley explores the software engineering question of object-oriented vs functional programming. Where did these ideas come from, what do they mean and why do they matter. Also, are there other ideas that may be coming in future?\n\nCD TRAINING COURSES\nIf you want to learn Continuous Delivery and DevOps skills, check out Dave Farley's courses\nhttps://bit.ly/DFTraining \n\nDAVE'S NEW BOOK\nYou can grab Dave Farley's new book 'Continuous Delivery Pipelines' here:\nhttps://leanpub.com/cd-pipelines\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#GOTOxDaveFarley #OOP #FP #ObjectOriented #FunctionalProgramming #ObjectOrientedProgramming #DaveFarley #GOTO #GOTOcon #ContinuousDelivery #DevOps #Testing\n\nDAVE'S LINKS\nhttps://www.continuous-delivery.co.uk\nhttps://twitter.com/davefarley77\nhttp://www.davefarley.net\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
