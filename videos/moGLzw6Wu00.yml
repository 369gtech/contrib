description: "Performance is critical. Yet it often feels like developers are forced to choose between powerful JavaScript frameworks with significant performance drawbacks or high-performance apps that require a huge amount of custom coding. For the average developer, this can be overwhelming. We operate with time and budget constraints. “I want to care about performance, but where do I start? How do I prioritize it?”\n\nThis talk will overview the performance challenges of building in the modern web landscape, current approaches to tackling those challenges, and how we can lower the barrier to entry to make these techniques more accessible.\n\nAmberley Romo\nSoftware Engineer, Gatsby\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc\n\nSave 10% off any FITC event with discount code 'youtube'.\nSee our upcoming events at www.fitc.ca"
