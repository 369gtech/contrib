description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2017\n—\nC++17 adds many new features: structured bindings, deduction guides, if-init expressions, fold expressions, if constexpr, and enhanced constexpr support in the standard library. Each of these features are interesting, but what will be their cumulative effect on real code? We'll explore how each feature may (or may not) help in real code for enhanced readability, compile time performance and runtime performance.\n— \nJason Turner: Developer, Trainer, Speaker\n\nHost of C++Weekly https://www.youtube.com/c/JasonTurner-lefticus, Co-host of CppCast http://cppcast.com, Co-creator and maintainer of the embedded scripting language for C++, ChaiScript http://chaiscript.com, and author and curator of the forkable coding standards document http://cppbestpractices.com. \n\nI'm available for contracting and onsite training.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
