title: 'The Genius of the RISC-V Microprocessor - Erik Engheim - NDC TechTown 2021'
language: English
recordingDate: 1635800920
description: "Isn't RISC-V just the Linux of microprocessors? No, and in this talk we will instead focus on the innovative instruction extension mechanism and clever design choices of the RISC-V architecture.\n\nWe will look at what makes RISC-V so different and what it means to the future of the industry as well as software developers.\n\nThis will be an intro to how modern CPUs work with an emphasis on RISC-V design choices compared to x86 and ARM processors. We will cover concepts such as compressed instruction sets, macro-fusion and micro-operations.\n\nThen we will talk about why the RISC-V design makes it favored by startups trying to revolutionize machine learning, high performance computing and embedded systems."
