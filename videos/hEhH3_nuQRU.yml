description: "Performance testing analysis, as well as application/server problem investigation, have never been easy and quick. However, here in Thomas Cook, we were able to improve and simplify the given above processes. Just through some modification/configuration of open-source solutions such as JMeter and ELK-stack tools we able to build performance testing reporting framework which can do the following:\n\n– Easily find Bottlenecks on Script level, Business transaction and request level.\n– Get to raw request-response trace of failed transactions just through several clicks.\n– Get separate statistics for business transactions spread among several scripts.\n– Visualizing in a representative way.\n– And much more…\n\nJoin our talk to look at everything listed in action!"
