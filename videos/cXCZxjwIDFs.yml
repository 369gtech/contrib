description: "Philipp is a Developer Advocate at Elastic, spreading the love and knowledge of full-text search, analytics, and real-time data. He is a frequent speaker at conferences and meetups about all things search & analytics, databases, cloud computing, and devops. Philipp lives in Vienna where he enjoys experimenting with software, organizing meetups, and sports.\n\nTalk summary \nBut it doesn’t have to be! This talk gives an overview on how to monitor Spring Boot applications, since they are increasingly popular for building microservices. We dive into:\n\nSystem metrics: Keep track of network traffic and system load.\nApplication logs: Collect and parse your logs.\nApplication metrics: Get the information from Boot’s metric and health endpoints and store it.\nRequest tracing: Use Sleuth to trace requests through a distributed system.\nUptime monitoring: Use Heartbeat to ping services and actively monitor their availability.\nAll the data will be aggregated and visualized in Kibana. So you will learn how to collect and centralize data from your distributed application and then visualize it in its entirety — giving you an all around view of your system."
