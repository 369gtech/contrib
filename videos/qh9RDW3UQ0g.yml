description: "Slides: https://www.slideshare.net/AlexEllis11/openfaas-jeffconf-2017-milan-80288839/1\n\nAlex will present OpenFaaS, an open-source framework that allows you to package any code or container as a serverless function. Prometheus is baked into the stack meaning you have 1st class support for metrics and auto-scaling. You can also bring your own Swarm or Kubernetes cluster and leverage high-availability and orchestration with your existing tools. Alex will show OpenFaaS in action through hands-on demos including the Alexa Voice Assistant. OpenFaaS has over 5k GitHub stars and is being evaluated by the likes of Huawei, ADP and CodeFresh.\n\nJeffConf Milan - 29 September 2017\nhttps://milan.jeffconf.com"
