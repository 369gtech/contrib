description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nTurning Your Cloud Native Apps Inside Out With a Service Mesh - Adam Zwickey & Liam White, Tetrate\n\nCloud native best practices have come a long way from the mid-2010’s when adopters of cloud native patterns were utilizing in-app libraries to manage concerns around load balancing, circuit breaking, service discovery, etc. Many adopters of modern cloud platforms have now realized greater agility and ease of use when those primitives are separated away from the application and managed independently in a cloud platform. This talk will review the pitfalls of those earlier application patterns with an assessment of why we've moved on and, most importantly, the benefits of now operating with an Envoy-based Service Mesh to help you manage your environment and enhance your development practices. It will also address how using a service mesh will help you migrate to this newer development style faster and safer to better enhance your organization's delivery times for updates to products and services."
