description: "Managing CRDs and Operators in Practice - Zhen Zhang, Alibaba & Wei Guo, Ant Financial \n\nManage one Operator is easy, but manage tons of Operators is hard, especially, when those Operators come from various teams throughout the country. In this talk, we will share experience & practices of developing and managing CRD + Operators across teams, with most of these developers are new to K8S API. We will talk about CRD standard we created to restrict common labels and fields for different kinds of CRD and ensure all CRD and Operators be formed to K8S conventions. We will share our CRD review process with code and config checking tools as well. We will then walk through a real use case to demo how these technics apply to refactoring a traditional middleware app into Operator. We will share challenges of using Helm to package these Operators, including Service Catalog integration and dependency mgmt. We believe this experience applies to any public cloud as well. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPXH"
