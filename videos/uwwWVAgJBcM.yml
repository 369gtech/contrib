description: "I'll perform linear regression from scratch in Python using a method called 'Gradient Descent' to determine the relationship between student test scores & amount of hours studied. This will be about 50 lines of code and I'll deep dive into the math behind this.\n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/linear_regression_live\n\nPlease subscribe! And like. And comment. That's what keeps me going.
