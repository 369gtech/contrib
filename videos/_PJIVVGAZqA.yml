description: "MongoDB is the #1 database that developers want to learn this year, according to the 2017 Stack Overflow developer survey. This full-day workshop mixes lecture and hands-on exercises to teach you how to use MongoDB with Perl, led by the author of the MongoDB Perl driver. We'll cover when to use MongoDB (and when not to!) and you'll leave the workshop knowing CRUD operations, indexing, aggregation pipelines, effective schema design, and more. Strong-beginner or better Perl skills recommended.\n\nThis tutorial requires a separate $99 ticket. 100% of workshop fees will be donated to The Perl Conference, courtesy of MongoDB.\n\n\nDavid Golden wears many hats in the Perl community. In his day job, he works at MongoDB, where he maintains the MongoDB Perl and C++ drivers."
