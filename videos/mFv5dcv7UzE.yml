description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Chicago 2014\nhttp://gotochgo.com\n\nMichael T. Nygard - Author of \"Release It!\"\n\nABSTRACT\nIt has been five years since Patrick Debois coined the term DevOps to describe a way of working together to deliver systems. In that time, we have rediscovered some gems from the past and we have invented new techniques and tools. In this session, we will take a look at what's new in the world of DevOps, what's old-but-good, and where we still need to advance.\n\nPlease find slides here: http://gotocon.com/dl/goto-chicago-20...\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotochgo\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
