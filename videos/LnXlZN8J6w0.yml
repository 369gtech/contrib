description: "Speakers: Tushar Katarki, Itay Gabbay\nAI is popular and yet faces two big challenges in the industry: 1) self-service and automation 2) Use in real production.\n\nAt the Israel Ministry of Defense we are taking on the challenges with containers and Kubernetes. We have built AI-as-a-service with open source tools and Kuberentes. Our Data Scientists use the service for data, experimentation and to deliver models into production iteratively with self-service and automation.\n\nUsing Kubernetes, we are able to run massive machine learning pipelines automatically, and improve our machine learning models. We implemented several principles of AutoML - a wide research area nowadays. Using AutoML & Kubernetes, we can further improve our machine learning models and pipelines - automatically.\n\nCome find out how we built our AI service on Kubernetes, issues we ran into and best practices with a live demo and supporting slides."
