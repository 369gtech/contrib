title: 'How to build a scalable serverless IoT architecture on GCP - Andrea Ulisse (ITA)'
language: Italian
recordingDate: 1510793030
description: "Andrea will show how to build a performant, reliable and scalable serverless IoT architecture powered by Google Cloud Platform (GCP) managed services, the same tools used by Google for its productions services which are now available for developers and companies. Such architecture allows you to focus on delivering value to your business rather than managing the underlying infrastructure. Google Cloud has always believed in the vision of serverless, starting with Google App Engine in 2008, Googleâ€™s first fully serverless compute service. Since then, Google has evolved more serverless offerings in Application Development, Data Analytics and Machine Learning.\n\nJeffConf Milan - 29 September 2017\nhttps://milan.jeffconf.com"
