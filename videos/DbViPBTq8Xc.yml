description: "PyData Berlin 2018\n\nThe confusion around terms such as like NoSQl, Big Data, Data Science, SQL, and Data Lakes often creates more fog than clarity. However, clarity about the underlying technologies is crucial to designing the best technical solution in any field relying on huge amounts of data including `data science' and machine learning. In this talk I will try to lift the fog.\n\nSlides: http://bigdata.uni-saarland.de/publications/Big Data Systems Performance - The Little Shop of Horrors.pdf\n---\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
