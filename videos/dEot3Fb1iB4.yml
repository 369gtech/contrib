description: "Large Partially-connected Erlang Clusters\n\nHave you heard of a Node100 problem? Naïve Erlang clusters are complete network graphs which tend to blow up with a only a handful (100+) number of nodes. Solution is partially-connected mesh networks. The tricky part is easy communication for devs and transparent cluster management for devops.\n\nIn Spil Games n-tier architecture we use native Erlang message passing between tiers. Thus our cluster size (way over 500) requires partially connected network.\n\nIn this talk I will present a library which helps to create and maintain medium to large Erlang clusters. We have been using it for over 2 years now and time has come to announce and open-source it.\n\nThis talk is a part of the continuous effort Spil Games is making to give back to the community, as seen in Erlang Factory 2014 with the release of erl-cache and erl-memcache.\n\nTarget audience\n\nEngineers interested or working with medium to large-scale Erlang clusters."
