To clarify, both Jason and Sean have seen War Games. At the time of filming neither had seen the film \"Ready Player One\", which was not yet released. \n\n(War Games features in the Ernest Cline book \"Ready Player One\" - whether it survives the transfer to the big screen remains to be seen)\n\nComputer that Changed Everything: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LYRgrqJgDc \nAtari VCS 2600: Coming Soon\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/computerphile\nhttps://twitter.com/computer_phile\n\nThis video was filmed and edited by Sean Riley.\n\nComputer Science at the University of Nottingham: https://bit.ly/nottscomputer\n\nComputerphile is a sister project to Brady Haran's Numberphile.
