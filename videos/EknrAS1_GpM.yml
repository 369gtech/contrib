title: 'Cloud Chaos and Microservices Mayhem by Holly Cummins'
recordingDate: 1621186930
description: "The way we use Java has changed. Applets - or any browser-side Java - are a long, long, time ago. Java moved to the back end, and stayed there, but the back-end has gotten bigger, more distributed, and more complicated. Some things that were a good idea ten years ago turn out to be a terrible idea in the cloud; and what used to be ‘good enough’ for testing really isn’t anymore. Managing microservices architecture demands a lot of us, to ensure observability, operational resiliency, and organisational agility. This talk will introduce some of the new tools, patterns, and best practices for Java development in 2021. It also gives a tour of some of the most painful anti-patterns Holly as seen as a consultant with the IBM Garage.\n\nHolly Cummins, IBM\n\nPresented at Jfokus conference 9th February 2021.\nhttps://www.jfokus.se"
