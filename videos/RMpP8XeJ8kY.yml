title: 'Graphing Your Way Through the Cosmos: Common Data Problems Solved with Graphs - Chad Green'
language: English
recordingDate: 1611569294
description: 'Data as it appears in the real world is naturally connected, but traditional data modeling focuses on entities which can cause for complicated joins of these naturally connected data. That is where graph databases come in as they store data more like what happens naturally in the real world. Sure, there a lot of talk about using graph databases for social networks, recommendation engines, and Internet of Things; but using graph databases can also make a lot of sense when working with common business data problems. In this presentation, you will get a better understanding of what graph databases are, how to use the Gremlin API within Azure Cosmos DB to traverse such data structures, and see practical examples to common data problems.'
