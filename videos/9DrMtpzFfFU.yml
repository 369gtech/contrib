description: "Visualize and Analyze Network Traffic of BOSH-Releases in Real-Time [I] - Marco Voelz, SAP    \n\nWith BOSH, you can deploy complex distributed systems like Cloud Foundry with ease. The difficulties start with day 2: If you are an operator, you need to gain a deep understanding how your system behaves, especially in error cases. \n\nThere are some methods to increase understanding of production system: A real-time visualization of a system's network traffic makes it easy to spot anomalies. Additional usage of a chaos-monkey can help you to verify your assumptions about the system's ability to cope with certain errors. You can gain more insights if you drill deeper in the raw network data.\n\nIn this talk, we show how we built a visualization and analysis tool for a netflix-like intuition engineering experience entirely from open-source components. By looking at a small example and a bigger Cloud Foundry installation, we discuss how both, visualization and deeper analysis can help us to get a better understanding of our system and discover new insights. And, of course, we use a few BOSH features to make our lives easier.\n\nMarco Voelz\nDeveloper, SAP SE\nMarco is a software developer at SAP working as PM in the BOSH OpenStack CPI project. He is a committer in BOSH and spends most of his time with monitoring, automation, and nitty-gritty infrastructure details."
