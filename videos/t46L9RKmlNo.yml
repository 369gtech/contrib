description: "John Mertens - Principal Engineer - Shameless tech do-gooder\nLessons From Our First Trillion Messages with Flow\n\nTalk in three words: battle hardened Flow\n\nAbstract\nFor many Elixir converts, the attraction of Elixir was rooted in the promise of the BEAM concurrency model. The Flow library has made it easy to build concurrent data pipelines utilising the BEAM. The problem is, that while the docs are great, there are not many resources on running Flow-based systems in production. In this talk, John will share the lessons his team learned from processing their first trillion messages through Flow. Attendees will leave with practical knowledge they can apply directly to their applications.\n\nObjectives\nFill in some of the gaps between watching Jos√©'s introductory Flow talk and using it to power a highly-concurrent data processing pipeline.\n\nAudience\nDevelopers interested in using Elixir for data pipelines but want to know more about what it is like in a real-world system.\n\nThe speaker \nJohn is a problem solver who has spent the majority of his career using his technical skills to have a positive impact on the world around him. Currently he uses Elixir to empower social action at Change.org.\nGithub: mertonium\nTwitter: @mertonium\n\nElixirConf EU\nWebsite: www.elixirconf.eu\nTwitter: www.twitter.com/elixirconfeu\nMail: info at elixirconfeu"
