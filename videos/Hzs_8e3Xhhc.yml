description: "In theory, web performance, accessibility, and inclusive design all have similar goals: Provide the best, most consistent experience to all people using the minimal amount of resources.\n\nIn practice, this often falls apart.\n\nProduct creators define what it means to be performant from where they stand, which is typically from places of privilege with unseen biases, struggling to find true empathy with their users.\n\nThrough this talk, weâ€™ll examine how to build conscientiously, looking within to resist systematic problems in order to create more truly performant, accessible, and inclusive systems for our users.\n\nSlides: https://slides.com/tatianamac/how-privilege-defines-performance/fullscreen/\nAbout Tatiana: https://tatianamac.com/\n\nMore about performance.now(); https://perfnow.nl or https://twitter.com/perfnowconf\nReceive conference announcements in your inbox: https://perfnow.nl/subscribe"
