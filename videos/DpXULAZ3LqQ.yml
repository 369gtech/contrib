description: "Great public speakers are born. It's so unfair that they naturally can do that.\n\nWrong - it's a skill that can be learned. \n\nCome to this session if you want people to pay attention when you talk and are willing to try something new.\n\nIn our session we'll talk about what horrible presenters do (bring in your more cringe-worthy examples), what great presenters do, and practice a couple of simple things so you'll walk away immediately 50% better.\n\nTristan from Imagine Careers leads us through this session. He's given hundreds of presentations for audiences of all sizes. Teaching others how to present is one of his favorite topics!\n\nPresented at Code & Supply in Pittsburgh, PA.
