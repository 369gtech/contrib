title: 'Design process challenges for Mixed Realities - Sonja Rattay'
recordingDate: 1540990515
description: "When designing for mixed realities from a product perspective, designers encounter challenges that are hard to address with the standard methods and tools. From concept sketching to user testing, mixed reality experiences need different formats and approaches to enable positive results. In this talk I will share some of our experiences dealing with these challenges and the insights we gained.   \n\nSonja Rattay is UX Lead and Co-Founder of Block Zero. Together with her clients she work towards creating experiences which bring humans and technology closer. Projects Sonja has worked on range from creating immersive fashion technology exploring the perceptual senses of the human body to UX for embodied interaction and creating machines with personality. She talks about her work at conferences across Europe and gives workshops on topics such as empathic design and futuristic interfaces. \nWhen Sonja is not working with clients she is learning about the human brain, travels the world and tinkers with new technologies such as implants, MR and robots.\n\n__________________________\nFoo Café is a meeting place for people with an interest in software development and IT. \n\nHere, user groups and partner companies find the perfect atmosphere for sharing knowledge and develop competence. \n\nFoo Café is open for everyone and is free to attend.
