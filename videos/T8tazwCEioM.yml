description: "When he was 9 years old, little David Ostrovsky found a book in Russian called \"Electronic Computational Machines\" at the local library and, after reading it cover-to-cover in a single weekend, decided that this was what he was going to do with his life. Three years later he finally got to touch a computer for the first time and discovered that it was totally worth the wait. One thing led to another and now he’s a Senior Solutions Architect at Couchbase. \n\nDavid is a software developer with over 17 years of industry experience, a speaker, trainer, blogger and co-author of the book “Pro Couchbase Server”, published by Apress Media and the “Essentials of Developing Windows Store Apps Using C#” and “Advanced Windows Store App Development Using C#” Microsoft official courses (20484, 20485), as well as numerous articles. He specializes in big data architecture and large-scale distributed systems."
