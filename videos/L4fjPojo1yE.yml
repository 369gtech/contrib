description: "As hardware components become smaller our dystopian future dreams come closer to reality. What would modern cybernetic augmentations look like? And how would we program them? The desire for full body autonomy through transhumanism is at our fingertips, so what can we build with the tools we have right now? Through modern hardware components and traditional special effects makeup let's explore what a modern cyborg could be.\n\nRachel White\nMICROSOFT\n\nRachel White is a technologist, artist, and pretend-cyborg who is currently a Tech Evangelist at Microsoft.
