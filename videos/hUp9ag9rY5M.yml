In this talk, firstly we will introduce our work for offering spark service via Kubernetes deployment as public cloud services, like: Authorization and Logging, and multi-tenancy through namespace and quota management of Kubernetes, etc. Then we will share the best practices of performance tuning details while running Spark application, includes: tuning detailed configurations from Kubernetes and Spark for maximum resource utilization, integrating with zookeeper service to achieve high availability, etc. In prospective of performance, the TPC-DS workload is used to present performance impact brought by configurations change. \n\nTo learn more click here:  https://sched.co/FuLs"
