title: 'Smaller Pixel Formats (100 Days of Google Dev)'

description: "Compressed image formats like PNG, JPG and WebP do a fantastic job of reducing the file size of your images for distribution & transfer.

And serious application developers know that smaller images don’t have to stop with disk formats. \n\nFollow along as Colt McAnlis describes how to reduce your bitmap memory woes with the help of some of Android's not-so-obvious compressed pixel formats. Each one reduces the bits needed, per pixel, to produce a smaller memory footprint. But be careful, each one also reduces the visual quality of your image, so it’s important to understand what format, is best for what situation.\n\nWatch more Android Performance Patterns here: http://goo.gl/4ZJkY1\nJoin the G+ Community here: http://goo.gl/g7mxmI\nSubscribe to the Google Developers channel here: http://goo.gl/mQyv5L"
