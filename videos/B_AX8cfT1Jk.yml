description: 'If you were paying attention to the Democratic primaries in February, you''re probably familiar with the infamous Iowa Democratic Party caucus app build by Shadow Inc. that due to bugs and reporting mishaps had American politics in suspense for days afterwards. The Warren campaign had their own app. Ours worked. I built it. In this talk I''ll go into why the app was a success and a bit of what tech looks like in the campaign world.'
