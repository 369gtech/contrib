description: 'Freecoin is a set of tools initially designed to let people run reward schemes that are transparent and auditable to other organisations. It comprises of an electronic wallet and other side products which are designed to be generic and they can facilitate multiple blockchains, offline transactions, identity management and multi-signature authentication. The toolkit is written in Clojure and in this talk I will touch technical details about the design, the interaction with blockchain nodes as well as some more theoretical background and the empirical research that the products is based on.'
