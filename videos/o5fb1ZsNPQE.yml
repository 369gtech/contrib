description: "Presented by Ryan Day at JSLA (js.la) on Thursday October 24th 2013 - The \"Nodebases\" have arrived. `tables flip. chairs fall` Wait.. Rather than running for the hills with screams of \"making databases can't be for me\" let's gear up with some node modules and talk about how we can solve data woes. You can use the level module for great success, but you will find that Leveldb and node together have all of the primitives required to create any database. it's fast and fun. lets have an adventure!\n\n* twitter.com/soldair\n* github.com/soldair"
