description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io\n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nRust and Skaffold for Iterative Development on Kubernetes - Gastón Kleiman & Gilbert Song, Mesosphere\n\nIterative development requires to be able to quickly build/push/deploy. These tasks aren’t easy in a cloud-native environment, but automating them is worth the effort. Being able to see changes reflected as they are being done leads to a tremendous increase in developer velocity. In this talk we will show how automating building and pushing a service out to the a Kubernetes cluster remotely allows for quick iteration.   We will develop a REST service from scratch using Rust. The service will be deployed to Kubernetes, and continuous deployment will be achieved by using Skaffold.  This demonstration will be presented in steps, starting with a simple web server without persistence, then adding a DB to the Kubernetes deployment and using Diesel to connect with it. All the while Skaffold will be used to seamlessly watch our changes “show up” on the K8s cluster as we’re working.  \n\nTo learn more click here: https://sched.co/FuLo"
