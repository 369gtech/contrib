description: "Grace Nolan\nhttp://linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/122/\nIn the 1800s Windows 0days were extremely rare, so hackers at the time had to settle for the delicate art of lockpicking. In this short talk, we’ll learn about some of the zany lock mechanisms the aristocracy came up with to secure their valuables. We’ll talk about lock picking bounties and the transient era of perfect security. Yes, that’s right. Perfect Security. These ARE your great-great-great grandparents’ stories, so buckle up kiddo, you’re in for a wild ride."
