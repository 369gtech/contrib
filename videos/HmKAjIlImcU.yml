Maybe you’ve got a few new observability tools deployed. How is that working out for you?    Regardless of your adoption level – from logs on local boxes up to the highest cardinality traces and feature analysis – at the end of the day these are tools, not magic spells. How do you teach, train, use, evangelize, and measure the impact they have in your organization?    Cory has been a part of solo and large observability teams, in-house and vendor, and worked with dozens of companies. In this session he’ll explain some no-nonsense, tool agnostic methods for wringing more value out of what you have, identifying when to use new tools, how to handle migrations, how to measure value, and how to deal with “why does this cost so much?” \n\nhttps://sched.co/Uabb"
