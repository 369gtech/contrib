title: 'Valerie Andrianova - Baking Boards: Tweak the Recipe for Agile Development'
language: English
recordingDate: 1514910628
description: "This is a story about how we at JetBrains \"bake\" agile boards for different teams: product development, marketing, design, and technical writing. I will show live examples and explain various options that support different preferences and processes for each team.\n\nThis presentation will be interesting for everyone who has the drive to develop. These recipes are especially useful to anyone who thinks they don't have or don't need a process, or for those who do follow a process, but don't get results.\n\nSurprisingly, this is a true sign that you understand the concept of agilezen. Any cook can follow a standard recipe. A real chef knows how to make small adjustments that make a big impact. To build an agile practice that works for you and your team, all you’re missing is the secret ingredient."
