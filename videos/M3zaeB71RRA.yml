description: "Keith Laker, Senior Principal Product Manager, Oracle\n\nThis session demonstrates how, using SQL pattern matching techniques, you can speed up searching for fraudulent events within unstructured data, such as JSON files, compared to using other programming languages. As part of the presentation, a live demo reviews a specific business use case from financial services and provides conceptual simplified SQL to solve an evolving set of business requirements. Youâ€™ll see a simple five-step framework for constructing pattern-matching queries, and a live demonstration shows how easy it is to write and amend SQL-based pattern queries, compared to other programming languages."
