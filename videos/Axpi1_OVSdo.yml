title: 'Peter Flynn and Kevin Dangoor: Building Live HTML and Omniscient Debuggers in Brackets'
language: English
recordingDate: 1382972917
description: "The Brackets open source project is a sandbox for experimenting with new ideas in web tooling. In this session, lead Brackets developers will explain how two of them work: Live HTML Development, and a new approach to debugging JavaScript codenamed Theseus. We'll discuss the guts of as-you-type HTML preview: correlating the HTML in your editor to the DOM in your browser, tracking diffs, and applying them as incremental DOM updates. We'll also talk about Theseus, a project we've built in partnership with MIT. Theseus provides an \"omniscient\" view of your JavaScript's execution flow, spanning code executing in the browser and Node. Everything is open source, so you can use these techniques and code in your own applications.\n\nSource: http://2013.jsconf.eu/speakers/peter-flynn-kevin-dangoor-omniscient-debuggers.html\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
