description: "This video was recorded at Scala Days Copenhagen 2017\nFollow us on Twitter @ScalaDays or visit our website for more information http://scaladays.org \n\nAbstract: \nAkka is a great toolkit for a concurrent and resilient system, even if it's in Android. The BONX outdoor group-talk Android app is a VoIP -Voice over Internet Protocol- client for the extreme sports scene. It is an audio stream processing client app that has unique requirements such as fewer packets and resiliency.\n\nSince it is expected to run continuously during sports activities, which can be up to 7 hours for skiing or snowboarding, it should, therefore, minimize packets with some additional steps which may make BONX more complex. It should also be able to recover from any errors that occur during the activities, including network disconnection, hardware I/O errors and any other failures in each module. Akka works greatly to manage these types of errors. \n \nThe BONX app, which is built using Akka, detects failures in each module, and suspend or restarts the connection depending on its network environment, or recover from errors immediately without spoiling the user's experience. That's why the BONX app is rated almost five stars as of January 2017 at Google Play.\n \nThis talk is not just an introduction to a unique use case, but also demonstrates how Akka is a powerful and easy toolkit that can be used to ensure resiliency and concurrency in a minimal system."
