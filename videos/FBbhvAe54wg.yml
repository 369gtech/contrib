language: English
recordingDate: 1433260446
description: "Production debugging is hard, and it’s getting harder. With architectures becoming more distributed and code more asynchronous, pinpointing and resolving errors that happen in production is no child’s game. This session covers some essential tools and more-advanced techniques Java developers can use in their code to debug live servers and resolve errors quickly. It explores seven crucial techniques for distributed logging—and some of the pitfalls that make resolution much harder and can even lead to downtime. The presentation also touches on some little-known JDK tools that give you super-deep visibility into a live JVM without making you restart it or use a debugger.\n\n\nAuthor:\nTal Weiss\nTal is the CEO at Takipi (God mode in production code), where he’s responsible for the company's product strategy and operations. Tal has been designing scalable, real-time Java and C++ applications for the past 15 years.
