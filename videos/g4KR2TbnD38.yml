description: "Never been to an FITC event? We'd like to change that. Just email us at neverbeen@fitc.ca for a VERY special offer!\n\nAccessibility isn’t just about blindness and screen readers or running through a typical section 508 checklist. There are many other importance facets of accessibility that could be missed. In this session, we’ll discuss in detail what we mean when we say “accessibility” that includes vision, hearing, motor, and cognitive needs. Bermon will break down basic accessibility guidelines, browser support, and how to best raise awareness on your team.\n\nBermon Painter\nUser Experience Designer, bermonpainter.com\nhttps://twitter.com/bermonpainter\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
