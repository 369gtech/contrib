description: "Slides: http://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/microservices-organizing-large-teams-for-rapid-delivery\n\nA microservice architecture is pattern that is most commonly associated with larger organizations where services and teams are organized around separate business capabilities. In a project our team recently completed, we used a microservice architecture to allow us to organize a large team to develop a large analytics platform at speeds that would not have been possible using a more typical service-oriented architecture.\n\nIn this session, we discuss the organizational structure and communication and development strategies and tools to allow teams to work in parallel without drowning in process overhead and coordination costs."
