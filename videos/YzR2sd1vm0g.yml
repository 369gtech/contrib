description: "It turns out getting to Mars is hard, but that’s only half the battle. This talk will highlight some of the accomplishments of the Mars Curiosity mission and also some of the challenges encountered while on its journey of exploration.\n\nIn addition, expect examples of more spectacular failures from other Mars missions. At the least, you’ll learn a few things about how to approach planning for spacecraft failure, but more importantly, maybe these lessons can teach us all about how to plan for and learn from failure.\n\nBobak Ferdowsi\nSystems Engineer, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory\nhttps://twitter.com/tweetsoutloud\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobak_Ferdowsi\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc\n\nSave 10% off any FITC event with discount code 'youtube'.\nSee our upcoming events at www.fitc.ca"
