language: English
recordingDate: 1597890470
description: 'Identifying and enumerating assets has become incredibly easy thanks to all the tools that have been released in the past few years, but being the first to a new target can be the difference between a P1 and a Duplicate! This talk will cover how we were able to monitor, fingerprint, and catalog cloud assets at a rate of over 200 thousand hosts a second in an attempt to find bounty targets and the bugs within them before anyone else.'
