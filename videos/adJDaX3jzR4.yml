title: 'Building a Secure and Resilient Foundation POC for Banking at Intesa Sanpaolo with Docker EE'
language: English
recordingDate: 1509727038
description: 'Intesa Sanpaolo is one of the first banking groups in the Euro zone, with over 12 million customers and 4,600 branches in Italy. With a lot of traditional monolithic applications that are difficult to maintain and evolve, Intesa turned to Docker to help them both modernize the applications and improve their portability so that they could consider a multi-site architecture across multiple data centers. Using Docker Enterprise Edition (EE) for their POC, Intesa took the first step to “break the monolith” by containerizing their infrastructure, self-described as an “Infrastructure-as-code” pattern, and now use Docker EE to orchestrate the applications across sites. In this talk Diego Braga, Infrastructure System Specialist at Intesa, and Lorenzo Fontana, DevOps Engineer at Kiratech will share how they implemented Docker EE along with software-defined networking and storage solutions to validate Intesa’s architectural model and to build a geographical distributed multi-data center cluster, all while saving infrastructure costs and remaining compliant with regulations. They will highlight their CI/CD process using Docker and Jenkins, how the developer and ops team are now working together to implement a DevOps methodology and Intesa’s ROI in using Docker EE. They will also share Intesa’s future plans, including creating mixed Linux/Windows clusters that use the same overlay network and on-prem/public cloud clusters opportunities.'
