description: "PyData Warsaw 2018\n\nDeep neural network give very good results in visual object recognition tasks, but they require large number of training examples from each category. I'll present a class of neural network architectures, that can be used when only few training examples from each class are available. They are based on 'similarity learning' concept and can be used to solve various practical problems.\n===\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
