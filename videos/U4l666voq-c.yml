Tightly integrated with the Java compiler and virtual machine, JShell enhances the programming experience for the Java language. Attend this session to learn how to use JShell to explore new APIs, prototype code, or learn the Java language. Interactively explore new features of JDK 9.\n\nRobert Field is the lead engineer on the JShell project, he previously worked on the design and compiler/runtime implementation of Lambda expressions for the Java language (JDK8).
