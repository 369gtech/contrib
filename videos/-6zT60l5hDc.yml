description: "Symptoms: - boring code containing only getters and setters, - useless tests that only test Mocks and the business of the system, - slow development – every stupid feature can take Weeks -frustration – you read a lot of books about JEE, Spring, JPA, spend your time on stack overflow and you only find out that you made all wrong, - fear of refactoring - yes you have tests – but small change somewhere and suddenly injections do not work anymore, - You constantly need a real sorcerer and his XML spells in order to keep system running.\n\nIs that is what you do for living?\n\nAnd last but not least you are so jealous hearing that some other teams write great things in Scala, Python or even JavaScript in a few weeks.\n\nI know the problem. It is not Java that is bad ! The cancer is called @Annotations. Something that was introduced to liberate Java developers from XML programming hell. But after few years it became even a bigger mess. Really - @annotations are the GOTO of XXI century."
