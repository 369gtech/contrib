description: "React has been named the front-end library to learn in 2016 however few people talk about the React without mentioning Flux (or Redux or React Native or Relay). In this talk, we will explore the ecosystem of tools and libraries that surround React. We will look at the various Flux implementations (including a short explanation of Flux) like Redux, at some of the React routing libraries, at some of the reactive database or reactive API libraries and finally at everyday tools and techniques that make the React developer happy. By the end of this talk, you will have a greater grasp of the ecosystem and leave with new tools in your developer arsenal.\n\nEvent sponsored by Rangle http://rangle.io/ and Microsoft Canada \n\nRami Sayar\nhttps://twitter.com/ramisayar\nhttps://github.com/sayar\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
