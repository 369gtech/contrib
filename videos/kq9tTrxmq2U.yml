description: "John Dickinson\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/175/\n\n1space allows you to store data in different storage systems and access them as part of one unified namespace. It can also move data from one location to another based with a rules-based system. These two features together gives users the ability to have data where they need it without needing to rewrite apps to account for where data is right now. 1space supports OpenStack Swift and S3 APIs and currently can be used with OpenStack Swift, AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or another S3-clone.\r\n\r\nThis talk with introduce the 1space project and describe how it is used in production today. We'll go into detail about how it works and what's coming next in the project.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
