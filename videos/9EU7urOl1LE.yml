description: "Speaker: Mandy Michael, @mandy_kerr\r\n\r\nInteresting and impactful text is often deemed a “print only option”. But we can have those effects now with real web text.\r\n\r\nSo let’s have some fun with text! In this talk, Mandy will show you how to make effects with accessible, searchable, and selectable text (Without the need for complicated markup or JavaScript).\r\n\r\nWe’ll explore a variety of techniques including pseudo elements, clip-path, blend modes, gradients, transforms, variable fonts and more to create interesting headings, layouts and even emojis.\r\n\r\nSometimes it’s easy to forget the power of CSS but there is a lot you can do with a little creativity.\r\n\r\nAbout the Speaker:\r\n\r\nMandy is the Front End Development Manager at Seven West Media in Western Australia. Previously, she has worked as Head of Front End Development at The Brand Agency and also as a Digital Project Manager. She is a lover of CSS and Batman and blogs about her adventures in geek fashion.\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/SingaporeCSS/events/244533222/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/eGJL/"
