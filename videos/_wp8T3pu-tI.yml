title: 'Using Pull Requests to Drive Continuous Delivery - Forward 4 Web Summit'
language: English
recordingDate: 1457373782
description: "Continuous delivery at its best is about delivering -- in very short cycles -- usable software to each stage of the development pipeline, and striving for the end-goal of frequent high-quality production deployments.  By running pull request code in disposable environments, in conjunction with CI, the broader team can make decisions based on working software at every stage: from vetting features to internal stakeholders, to testing integrated features in staging, to the joy of a public announcement.\n\nWe will talk about some new technologies that enable such continuous delivery, with a demonstration of how teams at Heroku use pull requests to deliver features, fixes, and products software at high speed and quality.\n\nhttp://forwardjs.com/\nhttps://newcircle.com/"
