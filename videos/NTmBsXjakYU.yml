description: "The Raspberry Pi single board computer has become immensely popular with nearly two million boards sold. Its diminutive size and the fact that it is a bare circuit board rather than a boxed computer creates some confusion as to what exactly it is for. A situation that is exacerbated by its GPIO port that allows external electronics either home made or a finished product, to be attached to it.\n\nIn this talk presented by Simon Monk author of Raspberry Pi Cookbook, he will clarify the various niches into which a Raspberry Pi can fit and also showcase some of the more interesting uses of the Raspberry Pi with examples from the Internet and his own projects.\n\nThis webcast will cover:\n\n    What is a Raspberry Pi?\n    Pi vs. Arduino\n    Pi vs. BeagleBone Black\n    Some Examples from the Internet\n        FM Transmitter\n        Home Automation\n        Internet Radio\n        Jukebox\n        Retro Games Console\n    My Projects\n        A Simple Roving Robot\n        Interfacing with a Chronos Watch\n    Books\n        Raspberry Pi Cookbook\n        Programming the Raspberry Pi\n\nAbout Simon Monk\n\nSimon Monk is a writer on open source hardware and is author of the soon to be release 'Raspberry Pi Cookbook' as well as 'Programming Raspberry Pi: Getting Started with Python' and numerous books on hobby electronics and Arduino. \n\nProduced by: Audra Montenegro"
