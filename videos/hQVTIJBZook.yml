description: "Google Tech Talks\r\nWeb Exponents\r\npresented by Doug Crockford\r\nFebruary 27, 2009\r\n\r\nblog post: http://google-code-updates.blogspot.com/2009/03/doug-crockford-javascript-good-parts.html\r\n\r\nJavaScript is a language with more than its share of bad parts. It went from non-existence to global adoption in an alarmingly short period of time. It never had an interval in the lab when it could be tried out and polished. JavaScript has some extraordinarily good parts. In JavaScript there is a beautiful, highly expressive language that is buried under a steaming pile of good intentions and blunders. The best nature of JavaScript was so effectively hidden that for many years the prevailing opinion of JavaScript was that it was an unsightly, incompetent abomination. This session will expose the goodness in JavaScript, an outstanding dynamic programming language. Within the language is an elegant subset that is vastly superior to the language as a whole, being more reliable, readable and maintainable.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeaker: Douglas Crockford\r\nDouglas Crockford is a product of our public education system.
