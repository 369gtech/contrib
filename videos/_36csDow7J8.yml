title: 'Arkisto: an open-source, standards-based framework for digital preservation'
recordingDate: 1612093003
description: "Mike Lynch\n\nhttps://lca2021.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/90/\n\nArkisto is a project for digital data preservation which focuses on sustainability and reusability, based on open standards, taking a data-centric approach.\r\n\r\nThe basis of an Arkisto repository is simply a file system, with digital artefacts laid out on disk or object storage according to the Oxford Common File Layout standard (OCFL), which provides efficient versioning and digital preservation features. Human- and machine-readable data descriptions are included using RO-Crate, a format for managing linked data using the JSON-LD and Schema.org standards.\r\n\r\nDatasets stored in this format can be then indexed using open-source tools such as Solr or ElasticSearch and made available for search, discovery and download.\r\n\r\nArkisto is intended to address the issue of research data collections which are no longer being looked after, due to institutional changes, lack of funding or software support. Rather than locking collections in to a specialised or monolithic repository or database, Arkisto encourages a modular philosophy where the primary object, the data itself, is stored in long-lived formats which are easy to code against, and tools such as indices are relatively cheap to build, deploy and modify.\r\n\r\nI'll present a short explanation of the key standards and concepts behind Arkisto, and show a couple of applications of its use as a data publication repository at UTS, and at PARADISEC, an extensive collection of cultural data around endangered languages.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
