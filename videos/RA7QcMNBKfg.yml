This talk will present the missing ingredient; a library allowing you to use template strings with metavariables, both for generating and matching on abstract syntax trees. As examples, I will show how we have used this at Klarna to implement a small domain-specific language for business logic, and demonstrate how you too can easily write a parse transform and even implement your own DSL that compiles to Beam code.\_\"\n\nFollow us on Twitter @Erlangfactory \_https://twitter.com/#!/erlangfactory\_\nJoin our group on Linkedin Erlang Factory \_http://www.linkedin.com/groups/Erlang-Factory-2003110?trk=myg_ugrp_ovr"
