title: 'Tomasz Ducin - Backend-less Development Revisited'
recordingDate: 1475492096
description: "\"Backend-less Development Revisited\"\n\n“It’s obvious that SPA interfaces rely on RESTful APIs”. But does it have to be like this always? Tight-coupling between interfaces and APIs result in great development issues. Backend-less development is an emerging approach of decoupling the two sides, enabling them to be developed independently.\n\nThe costs and the benefits of mocking the entire API. The three possible architectural approaches in doing so. Simulating business logic in mocks using plain JavaScript and JSONs. Mock engine Examples in Angular.js and sinon.js. The technical and business aspects of separating frontend and backend - these are the topics I will cover, basing on my banking software development experience.\n\nMock your API and make your frontend truly independent!"
