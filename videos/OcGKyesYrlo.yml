description: "Abstract: Most mission-critical systems have distributed elements or are entirely distributed, resulting in a number of challenges: performance, scalability, reliability, resilience...the eight fallacies of distributed computing are alive and well! Messaging platforms are often used to solve these problems and increase the \"ilities\", but they don't come without a few complexities of their own. Come to this session to learn how to leverage open source solutions like Spring Cloud Stream, RabbitMQ, & Apache Kafka to maximise your distributed systems' capabilities while minimising complexity. All examples will be coded *live & in real-time*!\n\nSpeaker: Mark Heckler, Spring Developer Advocate, Pivotal\n\nFilmed at Pivotal Summit 2019 Singapore"
