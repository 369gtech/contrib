description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nHow Event Driven Autoscaling in Kubernetes Can Combat Climate Change - Annie Talvasto, CAST AI & Adi Polak, Microsoft\n\nClimate change is one of the biggest challenges of this century, and at the same time adoption of cloud services increases the world’s CO2 production. We will show a demo showcasing how we can combat climate change with Kubernetes, e.g. by using event driven autoscaling (KEDA), spot instances, aggregated data from multiple sources as well as CNCF projects. We will take you through the creation & ideation of the open source project and prove that by optimising your cloud & Kubernetes, you can also decrease the environmental impact of your compute."
