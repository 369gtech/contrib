title: 'Little Red Riding Hood & the k-d tree forest - JÃ¸rgen Kvalsvik - NDC TechTown 2021'
language: English
recordingDate: 1635928878
description: "Little Red Riding Hood was told strictly by her mother to stay on the path; developers are told to not implement fundamental data structures. Still, there is no better way to learn about a data structure than to implement it, and until recently the k-d tree was quite new to me. Like Little Red Riding Hood, my path was perilous and in the end there were some valuable lessons. In this talk I will take you on a journey through the meadows of computer science, the dark woods of C++ rules, the sharp teeth of optimisation, the red cloak of templates, and the gift basket of class layout. We will discuss the various problems that show up when designing general data structures, and ways of addressing them. Who knows, maybe even a hunter shows up?\n\nIn this talk I will take you on a journey through the meadows of computer\nscience, the dark woods of C++ rules, the sharp teeth of optimisation,\nthe red cloak of templates, and the gift basket of class layout.\n\nWe will discuss the various problems that show up when designing general data\nstructures, and ways of addressing them.
