description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nSponsored Session: Rancher - Longhorn for Your Edge Deployments\n\nSpeakers: Joshua Moody\n\nLonghorn is an Open Source Cloud-Native distributed block storage engine built on and for Kubernetes that provides persistent storage support for any Kubernetes cluster with a one-click installation. In today's demo Joshua Moody from SUSE will demonstrate how to use Longhorns persistent storage for your edge deployments. We will use Ranchers K3s to manage and deploy Longhorn into our edge cluster consisting of a couple Raspberry Pi worker nodes which act as our data collectors as well as a randomly chosen Raspberry Pi that acts as our data aggregator. We will utilize Longhorns data redundancy and fail over mechanisms to demonstrate a failure and recovery of the data aggregator."
