language: English
recordingDate: 1609866572
description: "Talk \nDask is a widely used parallel computing solution for PyData. As Dask is deployed more into production we see challenges around costs, auth, security, and others. This talk discusses challenges and opportunities around deploying Dask in production, and a specific service, Coiled, designed to both ease institutional adoption of scalable PyData and increase accessibility to the general public.\n\nSpeaker\nMatthew is an open source software developer in the numeric Python ecosystem. He maintains several PyData libraries, but today focuses mostly on Dask a library for scalable computing. Matthew worked for Anaconda Inc for several years, then built out the Dask team at NVIDIA for RAPIDS, and most recently founded Coiled to improve Pythonâ€™s scalability with Dask for large organizations.\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
