description: "I had two special guests on this months Office Hours. Jacek Gebal and Samuel Nitsche got given the ultimate challenge. To take an unseen application code base, and build a suite of unit tests around it without knowing the full details of the application requirements, the data model etc.\n\nWatch this session to see how they did, and see the utPLSQL tool in action during live unscripted demos.\n\nblog: https://connor-mcdonald.com\ntwitter: https://twitter.com/connor_mc_d\n\nAll other social media channels here: https://linktr.ee/connor\n\nAre you serious? A free Oracle database forever ?!?!?!?! Indeed!\n\nhttps://www.oracle.com/cloud/free\n\n\nMusic: Night Owl (Broke For Free), Dyalla\n\n#oracle #testing #utplsql"
