description: "Using Progressive Web Apps to control IoT Using a PWA app to control an IoT device using JS frameworks\nby Nicholas Herriot\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/H.1308/pwa_control_iot.webm\n\n\nUsing Progressive Web Apps (PWA) to control IoT devices using JS frameworks \n\nWhat you will learn\n* What is a PWA\n* Why is a PWA so cool!\n* How a PWA can control IoT\n* Why should a PWA control IoT\n* A cool demo of a PWA controlling a thing! Content\n\n1) What are progressive web applications? A basic overview and their frameworks. A quick mention of web components.\n2) The Samsung things.samsunginter.net demo. The demo at the start showing a PWA app controlling an IoT thing via BlueTooth Low Energy (BLE) interface.\n3) Controlling bluetooth low energy from our PWA application. Concerns of browser support and issues developers may have.\n4) A breakdown of controlling your IoT thing, via BLE using for our demo a Javascript application running on a Linux OS with a raspberry pi zero.\n5) Why should a designer/ developer/ engineer consider using PWA and BLE for the control of ‘things’. And what about security concerns? \n\nWrapping it up\n\nGoing over key points. Good resources. Other technology frameworks to consider. Where to find details of code and this talk at SamsungInter.net \n\nRoom: H.1308 (Rolin)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 10:00:00+01"
