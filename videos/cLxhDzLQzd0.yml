description: "Working in the European refugee aid movement for the past year has been a real eye-opener. Technology has the power to significantly help their efforts, but it can cause more harm to be done if the ethics and impact aren't properly considered. We will start by reviewing the tools that aid groups currently use, and surprising situations where they can't or won't use software to solve a problem. With that in mind we'll look at what it takes to introduce new software tools to the field successfully. Finally, we'll discuss ethical considerations of technology that impacts migrants and outline specific, actionable steps that we can all take to improve on the current situation.\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
