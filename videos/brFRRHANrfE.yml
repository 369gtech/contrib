recordingDate: 1468311396
description: 'In my talk I will explain how the IoT has changed the understanding of high-load and why this trend changes the rules. What are asynchronous sockets and how they work. What are the solutions up to date and why Netty has no competitors. How does Netty work, what are its strengths, weaknesses, pitfalls. How does the architecture of our Blynk IoT platform look like and why we donâ€™t use Spring, Hibernate, RDBMS and other traditional java mainstream technologies in it. How vanilla java allows to build and design extremely fast applications.'
