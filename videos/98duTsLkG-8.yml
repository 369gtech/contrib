description: "Python meetup by Point Nine 23.10.2018\n\nPoint Nine is a company that provides technical services to the players in the financial world. Imagine hedge funds, brokers, provident funds and even banks that perform a lot of trades but do not have proper systems to make their trading activity visible from different angles as well as carry out their reporting obligations.\n\nOne of the biggest Point Nine services is the Middle Office platform called Circle, written in Python. It provides nice and useful reports to our clients, makes various consistency checks and reconciliations of their data versus the external platforms that also have information about their transactions. Circle also handles settlements, uploads data to third parties for execution or control. Evgeniy will tell you more about the problems we solve with Circle, the challenges we face and the ways to overcome them."
