description: "Spring Boot has seen a tremendous increase of usage since its inception. Developers like it for its default convention over configuration approach that improved project setup time. Ops like it for its friendly monitoring endpoints. But there’s more to that.\n\nDid you know you could update your code and see changes without restarting the container? Or automatically restart the server when a static resource changes? Or automatically refresh the browser when a web resource changes? Or… well, you get the point.\n\nCome to this talk to get a productive Boot."
