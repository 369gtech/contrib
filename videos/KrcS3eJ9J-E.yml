title: 'Web Components with Jeff Tapper'
recordingDate: 1412801018
description: "Web Components provide a necessary element for large scale applications: the ability to build Web Apps as a set of encapsulated, maintainable and reusable components. In order to use Web Components, a series of emerging web platform features such as the Shadow DOM, HTML Imports and Custom elements, need to be used, each of which have varying support in browsers today.  However, with the help of the Polymer project – a set of polyfills and an application framework using these principles – Web Components can be used today.\n\nIn this session Jeff Tapper will explore Web Components, and walk through creation of a Web Component for a modern JavaScript project."
