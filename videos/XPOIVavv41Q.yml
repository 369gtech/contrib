description: "This video was recorded at Lambda Days 2019 http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2019\n\nGet involved in Lambda Days' next conference http://www.lambdadays.org\n\n---\n\nDOES JAVASCRIPT ADOPTS FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING?\nby Yoav Luft\n\nABSTRACT\nIn this talk I'll present a small study I'm conducting which attempts to determine whether Javascript developers are adopting more declarative programming style, and whether this style influenced by functional programming. The study analyses code from popular open source projects to detect changes in coding style.\n\nRead the full abstract: http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2019/yoav-luft\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - YOAV LUFT\nMaking software for the jilted generation @ Prototyp SE\n\nYoav was born and raised in Israel and had recently moved to Sweden with his partner Dafna. Since his first line of code (Q Basic, age 11) until this day he had tried to perfect his knack for doing more work with less effort. He is highly involved with the meta of programming: how we work, think, develop and communicate. He is the founder of Israel's first functional programming conference, FLIP, and was on the organising team for HackExtend - a diversity focused hackathon. He now creates awesome software at Prototyp.se\n\nMore on Yoav Luft: http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2019/yoav-luft\n\n---\n\nLAMBDA DAYS & ERLANG SOLUTIONS\nLambda Days is powered by Erlang Solutions.
