description: "Deepa Dinamani\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/113/\n\nDrivers, filesystems, sockets, input events, vdso, python?? and more... Everything that needs to be fixed to prevent from time overflow. This is a talk about some of the problems I expected, and new ones I discovered, on our way to solving the 32-bit timestamps problem for the Linux Kernel.\r\n\r\nI work with Arnd Bergmann on solving the y2038 problem.\r\nI would like to paint a picture of how we see the problem: our design principles, strategies and end with where we are today.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
