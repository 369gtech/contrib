description: "Back in the day, game developers were in a similar position to where web-based game developers using HTML5 Canvas are today; Graphics rendering methods were slow and they had to come up with very clever techniques to squeeze every single bit of performance from their computers. In this webcast, Andres Pagella will take attendees on a journey through history, discussing how many famous games were able to have graphics and animations that were far ahead of their time and teaching how we can apply those performance-improvement techniques in modern web-based game development projects.\n\nAbout Mario Andrés Pagella\n\nMario Andrés Pagella, author of Making Isometric Social Real-Time Games with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript has been developing web applications for over 12 years and currently works as a technology consultant developing websites, mobile apps and games for many clients from around the world.\n\nWhen he is not spending time developing indie games, writing game and web development articles for his blog or advocating the use of HTML5 and JavaScript through his Twitter account, he loves to research and develop experimental projects.\n\nContact Andres: \n\nhttp://www.andrespagella.com\n\nhttp://twitter.com/mapagella\n\nProduced by: Yasmina Greco"
