description: "Presentation Slides: https://www.slideshare.net/hkarau/ml-... \n\n----------------\n\nTopic: ML Pipelines with Apache Spark & Apache Beam -- So you want to train a linear regression model (or deep learning) on big data?\n\nThe tools we use, from model training to model serving, are both under increasing pressure to handle larger datasets and users. This talk will look at how to use systems like Spark & BEAM to train your models, but also that important next step of actually serving the results in “production”.\n\nSpeaker: Holden Karau, Open Source Developer Advocate at Google\n\nHolden is a transgender Canadian (from Ottawa, living in SF) open source developer advocate at Google with a focus on Apache Spark, BEAM, and related \"big data\" tools. She is the co-author of Learning Spark, High Performance Spark, and another Spark book that's a bit more out of date. She is a committer and PMC on Apache Spark and committer on SystemML & Mahout projects. She was tricked into the world of big data while trying to improve search and recommendation systems and has long since forgotten her original goal.\n\nFollow Holden on Twitter: https://twitter.com/holdenkarau\n\n_____________\n\nSee these Meetups Live by joining the Reactive Data Meetup: \nhttps://www.meetup.com/OttawaReactive...\n\nABOUT US\nYoppWorks is a team of elite technical evangelists who are passionate and dedicated to deliver Responsive, Resilient and Message Driven Applications.
