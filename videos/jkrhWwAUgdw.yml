description: "Talk \nIn the era of AI thereâ€™s a renewed focus on making autonomous cars a reality. However there are many fallbacks like spurious identification of pedestrian as a piece of paper, ramming into bicycles due to missed identification. But the problem can be solved using thermal Images instead of RGB. This talk revolves around how I leveraged thermal images to enhance the vision of autonomous cars!\n\nSpeaker \nI am a Data Engineer at Couture.ai, India.
