description: "Speaker: Konstantin Hasse, Co-Founder and CTO, Travis CI\n\nLet's talk about salaries, diversity, career development, getting compensated in gold and silver, paying taxes in livestock and Ruby code. For the last year, we at Travis CI have been working on a new salary system to determine how much we pay whom, when employees get raises and a whole range of other things. After lots of back and forth, we ended up with a Sinatra application to solve salary questions. Expect to explore the topic from many different angles and levels. We'll look at decisions, realisations and implications, as well as interesting parts of the implementation.\n\nSpeaker's Bio\nCo-Founder and CTO at Travis CI, former opera star\n\nSlides: https://speakerdeck.com/rkh/how-we-replaced-salary-negotiations-with-a-sinatra-app\n\nEvent Page: http://www.reddotrubyconf.com\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/ONqP/"
