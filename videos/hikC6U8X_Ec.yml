But what actually are these values and principles? And what happens if they meet corporate values and principles?\n\nIn this presentation we will go on a tour through open source values and reflect on how they match or mismatch corporate values. We will see what practices fit in an Inner Source scenario and what tactics can be applied to use open source values as leverage to improve processes, collaboration, and openness within a corporation.\n\nWhere do values such as transparency, collaboration, commitment, or predictability belong? How can an Inner Source program make use of them, combine them, and contribute to the success of a company? The audience will hear about our experience, get inspiration for their own work, and food for thought for further discussions around the topic.\n\n###\n\nFollow us on Social Media and join the Community!\nTwitter: twitter.com/fossbckstg\nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/user/plainschw...\nSlack: https://20.foss-backstage.de/network-...\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/groups/8653059/\n\nFOSS Backstage is an event by Plain Schwarz â€“ https://plainschwarz.com"
