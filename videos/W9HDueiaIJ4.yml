title: 'Lambda Jam 2015 - Richard Feldman - Shipping a Production Web App in Elm'
recordingDate: 1445129094
description: "What happens when you take a 2011 CoffeeScript web app designed to edit 100,000-word novels…and scratch-rewrite it in Elm? It turns out the result is faster, more robust, and massively easier to maintain.\n\nFortunately, Elm’s simple design means that even a functional programming novice can quickly get up to speed on its static type inference, pervasive immutability, and first-class FRP system.\n\nThis talk dives into the nuts and bolts of shipping a production web app in Elm, including questions like:\n\n* Why should you choose Elm over the many other compile-to-JS languages?\n* How do you transition from an imperative architecture to Elm’s FRP system?\n* To what extent can you leverage the JavaScript library ecosystem without sacrificing your functional invariants?\n\nCome see how pleasant functional programming in the browser can be!\n\nRichard is a functional programmer who specializes in pushing the limits of browser-based UIs. He’s built a framework that performantly renders hundreds of thousands of shapes in HTML5 Canvas, a JavaScript immutables library that seamlessly interoperates with normal JS collections, a long-form writing web app that functions like a desktop app in the absence of an Internet connection, and much more in between.\n\nFor more on Lambda Jam, visit http://www.lambdajam.com"
