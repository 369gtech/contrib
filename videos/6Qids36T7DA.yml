description: "Does it make sense today to develop the same mobile application as many times as there are devices?\n\nWe were not supposed to stop repeat ourselves?\n\nProgressive Web Apps are the combination of web, plus the experience of native apps. You start from a tab in your browser and you finish with an icon on your home page… with no installation! As a native app, PWA brings other benefits such as sending push notifications, data-synchronization in background… also loading your application instantly, regardless of the network state (thanks to the service worker). During this session, we will see what are services worker and the 10 Commandments of a Progressive Web App. The debate between web and native is not ready to stop!"
