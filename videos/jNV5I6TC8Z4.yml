title: '"New Directions for Spark in 2015" - Matei Zaharia (Strata + Hadoop 2015)'
recordingDate: 1424488489
description: "As the Apache Spark userbase grows, the developer community is working to adapt it for ever-wider use cases. 2014 saw fast adoption of Spark in the enterprise and major improvements in its performance, scalability and standard libraries. In 2015, we want to make Spark accessible to a wider set of users, through new high-level APIs for data science: machine learning pipelines, data frames, and R language bindings. In addition, we are defining extension points to let Spark grow as a platform, making it easy to plug in data sources, algorithms, and external packages. Like all work on Spark, these APIs are designed to plug seamlessly into Spark applications, giving users a unified platform for streaming, batch and interactive data processing.\n\nWatch more from Strata + Hadoop San Jose 2015: http://goo.gl/k9J3GB\nVisit the conference website to learn more: http://strataconf.com/big-data-conference-ca-2015/\nSubscribe to O’Reilly on YouTube! http://goo.gl/szEauh\n\nStay Connected to O'Reilly Media by Email - http://goo.gl/YZSWbO\nFollow O'Reilly Media:\nhttp://plus.google.com/+oreillymedia\nhttps://www.facebook.com/OReilly\nhttps://twitter.com/OReillyMedia\n\nAbout Matei Zaharia (Databricks):\nMatei Zaharia started the Spark project at UC Berkeley and is currently CTO of Databricks.
