description: "by Joel Rebello and Juliano Martinez\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/H.2215/baseboard_management.webm\n\n\nThis talk is about a library written to help manage a fleet of bare metal servers,\nit leverages existing (mostly undocumented) APIs on Baseboard Management Controllers,\nand exposes a consistent API interface to, \n\n\nInventorize bare metal hardware\nManage BMC/BIOS configuration\nReliably Power cycle/PXE boot bare metal.\nUpdate firmware on BMCs\n\n\n\nhttps://github.com/bmc-toolbox/bmclib This talk is about bmclib, a library written to perform asset lifecycle management,\nacross a fleet of bare metal servers, it leverages existing (mostly undocumented) APIs on Baseboard Management Controllers,\nand exposes a consistent API interface to, \n\n\nInventorize bare metal hardware\nManage BMC/BIOS configuration\nReliably Power cycle/PXE boot bare metal.\nUpdate firmware on BMCs\n\n\n\nhttps://github.com/bmc-toolbox/bmclib \n\nWhile all of the above seems obvious functions of bare metal server hardware that should just work,\nin reality they do not - when dealing with ~45k units of bare metal server hardware from various vendors,\nthis is a lesson we learned and hence we developed bmclib and all of the various tools that is part of the bmc-toolbox. \n\nhttps://github.com/bmc-toolbox \n\nWe intend to talk about the current state of BMCs, the current vendor solutions to have a single API (Redfish)\nand the various tools that are part of the bmc-toolbox which were possible thanks to bmclib. \n\nAnother interesting project (which we intend to talk about) was to implement a service on top of bmclib to retrieve thumbnails from the BMC,\nof the screen of the server and run image classification on it to infer what state a bare metal is currently in,\nthanks to bmclib this was easy since we implemented a common method to grab \"Screen previews\" through the BMC. \n\nThe bmc-toolbox is built and maintained in Booking.com. \n\nRoom: H.2215 (Ferrer)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 17:00:00+01"
