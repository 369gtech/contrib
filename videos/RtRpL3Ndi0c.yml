description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTOpia November 2020. #GOTOcon #GOTOpia\nhttp://gotopia.eu\n\nStefan Tilkov - Co-founder & Principal Consultant at INNOQ\n\nABSTRACT\nIn this session, we’ll take a look at some of the ways we can determine whether the development efforts we’re undertaking suffer from too much or too little focus on architecture. We’ll examine a number of real-world examples that are intended to inspire either admiration or terror, and try to find some recipes of how we can get more of the former and less of the latter in our own projects.\nWhat will the audience learn from this talk? How to find the right balance between agile/ iterative/ incremental development, diving right into coding, up-front planning, and continuous architecture [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n00:32 First statement about architecture\n01:33 Second statement about architecture\n02:05 Third statement about architecture\n02:34 Architecture antipatterns\n03:33 Cases\n04:52 Case No. 1: Non-extensible Extensibility\n11:49 Case No. 2: Perilously fine granularity\n20:30 Case No. 3: Horizontal Conway split\n27:45 Takeaways\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotopia.eu/november-2020/sessions/1627/good-enough-architecture-part-1\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#SoftwareArchitecture #Backend #Antipatterns #ArchitectureAntipatterns\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
