title: 'Diving into advanced Kotlin features by Simon Wirtz'

description: "You have probably heard about that \"new\" JVM language Kotlin already. It's being praised in pretty much every conference and seems to become a serious competitor of Java. Kotlin can be used on multiple platforms like the JVM, Android or even in the browser. It is a rising language for sure and, according to recent GitHub statistics, itâ€™s also the fastest growing language in the world.\n\nMany introductions to Kotlin have been given so far, most of which demonstrate the most common features such as data classes, null safety, and extension functions. In this talk, we want to dive into some more advanced features of the language. We learn about concepts like reified generic types, function literals with receiver, internal DSLs, built-in delegation, infix functions, operator overloading, inline classes and more. This talk will give insights on how specific features of the language work and why you should know about them."
