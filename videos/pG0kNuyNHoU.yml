description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\n去哪儿网规模下 Kubernetes 多集群和 Canary 的部署 | Kubernetes Multi-cluster and Canary Deployment at the Scale of Qunar - Sheng Zou & Jenny Chen, Qunar\n\n去哪儿网是中国领先的在线旅游平台，成立于 2005 年 5 月，总部位于北京。去哪儿网基础设施团队在 2020 年底开始研究和应用 k8s，其计划在 2021 年底前将在生产中将所有应用程序迁移到 Kubernetes 中。随着云原生时代的到来，学习和拥抱云原生不可避免，因为其可以使业务运营更加敏捷。容器化是将应用转移到 Kubernetes 之前的第一步。如何将数以千计的应用程序高效、顺畅地从基于内核的虚拟机 (KVM) 迁移到容器已成为去哪儿网基础设施团队面临的一个巨大挑战。在此次讨论中，去哪儿网基础设施团队将讨论：- 如何将 CI/CD 模式从 KVM 发展到云原生时代——如何运用多集群和基于批量的 Canary 部署帮助应用程序、sdk 顺利进行升级——从 CI/CD 演化路径中吸取的教训。\n\nQunar is the leading online travel platform in China, founded in May 2005 and headquartered in Beijing. Qunar infrastructure team started researching and applying k8s in late 2020, Qunar planned to migrate all applications to Kubernetes in production by the end of 2021. As the clould-native era is coming, learning and embracing cloud native is inevitable as it can make business more agile. Containerization is the first step before shifting the applications to Kubernetes. How to make thousands of applications migrate from KVM to container efficiently and smoothly has been a huge challenge for the Qunar infrastructure team. In this talk, the Qunar infrastructure team will talk about: - How to evolve CI/CD model from KVM to cloud native era - How to help auto-upgrade application、sdk smoothly with Multi-Cluster, Batch-Based canary deployment - Lessons learned from the CI/CD evolution path"
