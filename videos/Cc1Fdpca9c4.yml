description: 'It’s been weeks and the organization you work for seems to be slowly turning against you. At least that’s what it feels like.

Operations have reported that a critical Node.js service owned by your team is spinning at 70-100% CPU, and all parts of the application dependent on the service are experiencing intermittent slowdowns or in some cases, complete unavailability. What are you going to do now?'
