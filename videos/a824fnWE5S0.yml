This talk will cover what the Google Expeditions team has learned from over a year of bringing immersive learning into classrooms around the world. It'll explore how immersive learning can be used with large, co-located groups, how to best equip an educator to teach with these tools and what elements make up compelling educational content.\n\nSee all the talks from Google I/O '17 here: https://goo.gl/D0D4VE\nWatch more Android talks at I/O '17 here: https://goo.gl/c0LWYl\nWatch more Chrome talks at I/O '17 here: https://goo.gl/Q1bFGY\nWatch more Firebase talks at I/O '17 here: https://goo.gl/pmO4Dr\n\nSubscribe to the Google Developers channel: http://goo.gl/mQyv5L\n\n#io17 #GoogleIO #GoogleIO2017"
