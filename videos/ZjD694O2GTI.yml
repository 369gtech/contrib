title: 'DevOps in Action: Show and Tell Session on Handling Production Grade Container'
language: English
recordingDate: 1502024411
description: "Oracle is building out many new services based on Docker containers and Kubernetes to optimize resource consumption and DevOps processes. As those technologies gain more traction, many wonder how to handle containers in development, how to test containerized services, and what options there are for CI/CD. In this session Oracle engineers share the entire DevOps flow they have implemented for their production services from development all the way to testing in production. You will gain deep insight into the decisions involved for what goes into container base images, what the CI pipeline looks like, how testing is done, when to promote new container images, and how different versions are handled. At the end of the session you will understand what it takes to build out a DevOps pipeline for production grade containerized cloud services.\n\nBoris Scholl\nVP Product Management, Microservices\nOracle"
