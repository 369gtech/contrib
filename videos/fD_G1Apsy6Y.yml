description: "(Recorded at Jfokus 2016. http://www.jfokus.com)\n\nBeing productive developer using JPA helper libraries\n\nStandard JPA has proved to do the mapping part really well, but quite many JPA developers spend way too much time writing and debugging JPQL/Criteria queries. What if you could just take the good parts of JPA and somebody else would write your queries? Helper libraries like DeltaSpike Data and QueryDSL will help you get there. Using a practical full stack Java EE example, you'll learn to write less queries, write the remaining ones faster and write them so that they work with the first run. DeltaSpike Data helps to write the first version of your DAO in a snap and automatically writes most queries for you, based on your method names only! QueryDSL lets you build your complex JPA queries with an intuitive and well typed API.\n\nMatti Tahvonen, Vaadin Ltd\n\nMatti Tahvonen has a long history in Vaadin R&D: developing the core framework from the dark ages of pure JS client side to the GWT era and creating number of official and unofficial Vaadin add-ons. Currently working as a developer advocate for Vaadin and building lots of example integrations with other cool JVM related libraries. The leisure time is spent on various nature related activities and sports, and making those hobbies more rewarding by developing software to support them."
