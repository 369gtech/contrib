description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2017\n—\nThe feature set for the C++17 release is set, and the release of the standard is just around the corner. In this session, we'll discuss all the new C++ features in C++17 and how they'll change the way we write C++ software. We'll explore the new standard in breath, not width, covering a cornucopia of core language and library features and fixes: \n\nLanguage Changes (part 1): \nStructured bindings\nSelection statements with initializers\nCompile-time conditional statments\nFold expressions\nClass template deduction\nauto non-type template parameters\ninline variables\nconstexpr lambdas\nUnary static_assert\nGuaranteed copy elision\nNested namespace definitions\nPreprocessor predicate for header testing\n\nLibrary Changes (part 2): \nstring_view\noptional\nvariant\nany\nParallel algorithms\nFilesystem support\nPolymorphic allocators and memory resources\nAligned new\nImproved insertion and splicing for associative containers\nMath special functions\nVariable templates for metafunctions\nBoolean logic metafunctions\n— \nBryce Adelstein Lelbach: NVIDIA, Senior Software Engineer\n\nBryce Adelstein Lelbach is a senior software engineer on the CUDA driver team at NVIDIA. Bryce is passionate about parallel programming. He maintains Thrust, a C++ parallel algorithms library, and he is one of the developers of the HPX C++ runtime system. He spent five years working on HPX while he was at Louisiana State University's Center for Computation and Technology, and three years at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (a US Department of Energy research facility) developing and analyzing new parallel programming models for exascale and post-Moore architectures. He also helped start the LLVMLinux initiative, and has occasionally contributed to the Boost C++ libraries. Bryce is an organizer for the C++Now and CppCon conferences as well as the Bay Area C++ user group, and he is passionate about C++ community development. He is a member of the ISO C++ standard committee, and worked on the C++17 parallel algorithms.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
