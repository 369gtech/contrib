description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nUncharted Territories: Discovering Vulnerabilities in Public Helm Charts - Hayley Denbraver, Snyk \n\nCNCF projects are making investments in security (including the recently open sourced security audits of both Kubernetes and Helm). Helm is an interesting case study because both the security of Helm as a tool and the security of Helm Charts are important considerations for users. What do we know about the security of individual Helm Charts, what can we find out, and how does that change how we approach the project? All these questions and more will be addressed as we plot course to Helm Chart security. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Zel7"
