title: 'Running Serverless Applications Using Spring and Microsoft Azure'
language: English
recordingDate: 1538586521
description: "Spring Cloud Function is a framework that provides a uniform programming model for writing functions as Spring Boot applications and deploys them across various serverless platforms. It decouples the developer from the runtime where it will be deployed and enables developers to focus on the business logic. The developer simply focuses on writing the functions. Spring Cloud Function provides various adapters to deploy the function applications to the target serverless runtimes. Microsoft Azure provides a fully “managed” serverless runtime for running functions on-demand without provisioning or managing any infrastructure, with rich integrations with cloud services. Spring Cloud Function provides an Azure adapter that enables the deployment of a function application written using the Spring programming model on Azure. In this talk, we will provide an overview of Spring Cloud Function, then do a deep dive into the capabilities of it using the Azure adapter. We will then do a hands-on demo by writing functions using Spring Cloud Function from the ground up, bind them to cloud event sources such as Event Hub and Cosmos DB, and deploy these functions to Microsoft Azure Functions.\nSpeakers:\nJeff Hollan\nSenior Program Manager - Azure Functions, Microsoft\nOleg Zhurakousky\nSoftware Engineer, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
