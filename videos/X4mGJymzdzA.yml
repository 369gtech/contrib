We'll take a look at:\n• Philosophies and Fads (Agile, DevOps, BDD/TDD/Shame Driven Development)\n• Programming Languages: Emerging vs Established\n• Hardware, the Cloud, Containers, and Serverless [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n01:24 Some history\n07:33 Tech philosophy\n08:17 Waterfall\n11:28 Agile\n13:55 DevOps\n16:52 TDD - Test Driven Dev.\n18:01 BDD - Behavior Driven Dev.\n18:50 SDD - Shame Driven Dev.\n19:55 Language zealotry\n20:42 Innovation: Startup world\n23:10 Innovation: Moving forward\n24:12 Conclusion\n26:59 Outro\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotochgo.com/2021/sessions/1802/the-pony-express-and-how-technology-moves-fast\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nWynne, Hellesoy & Tooke • The Cucumber Book • https://amzn.to/3tEUINJ\nRobert C.
