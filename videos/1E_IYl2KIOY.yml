description: "Filmed at http://2016.dotcss.io on December 2nd in Paris. More talks on http://thedotpost.com\n\nThis story sums up Varya's experience in developing modular web solutions and pattern libraries. She is currently doing exactly the same as what she was doing 8 years ago, but in a very different way. In fact, the reasoning of choices for methods and tools to apply goes directly from grasping human nature, no less. Hint: BEM, living style guides and visual regression tests are involved."
