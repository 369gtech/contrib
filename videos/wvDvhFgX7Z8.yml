description: 'This talk will cover a brief introduction to go test, before diving into the more interesting parts of using the tool and the library itself. Covering topics like enabling testing of un-exported objects in separate testing packages, interesting or unconventional flags, and the newly added caching mechanisms, the talk will aim to raise folks understanding and capabilities with go test beyond just the basics, to help gophers become better testers by simply introducing them to more of the test tool and library itself.'
