description: "Presented by Luke Karrys at JSLA (js.la) on Thursday October 30th 2014 - Ampersand.js is a highly modular, loosely coupled, non-frameworky framework. Composed of tiny modules, Ampersand is able to leverage the power of npm and Browserify to build advanced applications, while maximizing simplicity in the increasingly complex world of front-end application development. Learn some conventions and how to harness the flexibility of Ampersand to solve real problems presented by today's web apps.\n\n* twitter.com/lukekarrys\n* github.com/lukekarrys"
