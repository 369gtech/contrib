description: 'The purpose of this presentation is to serve as an introductory session for beginners while at the same serving as a reflective discussion of a topic regarded as “god-given / it just IS” by the wider population of users (including intermediates). Theoretical examination of the possible steps and paths the query lifecycle can take is depicted with simple but speaking examples. The impact of factors like basic analysis construction in Answers, advanced SQL clauses, caching, business model peculiarities like multi-star queries, snowflaking and LTS modelling as well as physical layer settings like call interfaces, data source parametrization or inclusion of hints in the RPD are to be showcased.'
