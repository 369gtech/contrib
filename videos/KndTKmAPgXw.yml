language: English
recordingDate: 1614770631
description: "Even ‘trusted’ hiring techniques we have been using for years are littered with unconscious biases, all the way from job description to selection process to interview. Through these stages we are discounting potentially great candidates from marginalized groups, non-traditional backgrounds and alternative career paths without even realizing it. \n\nIn this panel, we will identify and explore some of the biases that seep into our hiring processes."
