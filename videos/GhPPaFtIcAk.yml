title: 'Architecting for Failures in Microservices by Bhakti Mehta'
language: English
recordingDate: 1492084912
description: "Microservices is the new black. Distributed systems fail in the most spectacular ways, and hence architecting for failures is of utmost importance. Assume that everything will fail, and design backwards. Using examples of real life outages and failures, this session covers best practices for building resilient, stable, and predictable services as the cornerstones of working with microservice-based architectures. Key Takeaways are: Expect the unexpected. Dismiss nothing when it comes to debugging issues. Identify systemic weaknesses and take control of failures before they take control. Plan for resiliency through the stages of development to production and post production.\n\nBhakti Mehta is the author of \"Developing RESTful Services with JAX-RS2.0, WebSockets and JSON\" and \"RESTful Java Patterns and Best Practices\". She has over 15 years of experience architecting, designing and implementing software solutions on top of Java EE and other related technologies. She is passionate about open source software development and has been one of the founding members of GlassFish Application Server. Her areas of research include architecting solutions for resiliency, scale, reliability and performance with respect to server-side technologies, web services and cloud applications. Currently Bhakti is a Senior Software Engineer at Atlassian"
