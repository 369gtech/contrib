description: "Should there be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it?\n\nThomas Guest\n\nMonday 17th, 14:30 (Ferrier Hall)\nA talk (25 minutes)\nTIMTOWTDI stands for “There is more than one way to do it”, an approach promoted by the Perl community.\nA contrasting mantra appears in the Zen of Python, a list of aphorisms which summarise the guiding principles behind Python’s design. Item number 13 states: “There should be one — and preferably only one — obvious way to do it.”\nThis talk discusses these apparently different philosophies. It demonstrates that Python, like Perl, borrows features from other languages. Contrary to Item 13, there is — and has always been — more than one way to do it. Obviously."
