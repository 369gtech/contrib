description: "RubyConf 2019 - Story telling with Git rebase by Elle Meredith\n\nIn a successful software development project, a key challenge is to manage complexity because projects get very complex very quickly even within small teams. Version control is the tool for communicating intent in our codebase over the life time of the project. Rebasing allows us to revise our development history before sharing it with the team.\n\r\n\nLearn to use Git commit messages to keep track of the intent of your code changes to make it easier to make future changes. Learn how to make using feature branches less painful and more effective. Learn the mechanics of interactive rebasing, how to merge conflicts without losing precious code and how to auto-squash commits. Basically, stop fearing interactive rebasing.\n\n#confreaks #rubyconf2019"
