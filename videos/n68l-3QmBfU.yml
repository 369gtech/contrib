description: "Titel: Reactive Relational Database Connectivity\n\nAn increasing number of projects starts incorporating reactive programming. On their journey, they start to discover that the only way to get the full benefit of that change is to ensure that they have a fully reactive stack.\n\nThere are a number of messaging systems and data stores that enable a fully reactive stack, but there has been a big piece missing when it comes to accessing relational database systems in a fully reactive way. \n\nThis talk presents the Reactive Relational Database Connectivity (R2DBC) initiative. This project aims for what a reactive API would look like when paired with relational database access. This talk explains how the API works, the benefits of using it, and how it contrasts with the ADBA project proposed as a successor to JDBC.\n\nSpeaker: Mark Paluch - Spring Data Engineer - Pivotal\nMark is a Software Craftsman working as Spring Data Engineer at Pivotal. He has a strong focus on reactive infrastructure and works on MongoDB, Redis, and Apache Cassandra modules. Mark is also is project lead of the Lettuce Redis driver."
