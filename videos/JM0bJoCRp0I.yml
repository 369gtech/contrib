title: 'Deep Dive into Homomorphic Encryption - THR3001'
recordingDate: 1557337854
description: 'Learn directly from Microsoft Research about our latest breakthroughs on homomorphic encryption, an encryption technique that allows for computations to be done on encrypted data, without requiring access to a secret (decryption) key. The results of the computations are encrypted, and can be revealed only by the owner of the secret key. This opens a lot of new scenarios where privacy was a concern and we could apply this technique to make them possible, like Private AI.'
