description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM SF 19 http://bit.ly/2T3Do0U\n\nGet involved in Code Sync's next conference http://bit.ly/2Mcm4aS\n\n---\n\nFUNCTIONAL FARMING WITH NERVES\nby Connor Rigby\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nNerves\nin \nProduction\n\nTALK LEVEL: Beginner\n\nABSTRACT\nHow FarmBot rewrote it's embedded firmware in Elixir with Nerves in under a year. Connor will show how a weekend prototype was faster to develop, more stable and easier to deploy than the existing firmware. He will also show the integration of NervesHub to maintain the fleet of deployed devices.\n\nRead the full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/connor-rigby/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - CONNOR RIGBY\nEmbedded Systems Engineer at Farmbot, Inc\n\nConnor is an open source software engineer with a love for all things embedded with a passion for sustainability in both hardware and software.\n\nConnor is the single Elixir developer at FarmBot, Inc and core contributor to the Nerves and NervesHub projects. He has ported Nerves to a number of interesting devices such as the Nintendo Switch and Nintendo 3DS among others. Connor is a firm believer that the Beam should run anywhere, especially on embedded \"\"edge\"\" devices.\n\nMore on Connor Rigby: https://codesync.global/speaker/connor-rigby/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM SF 19\nCode BEAM SF is powered by Code Sync.
