description: 'Under the best of circumstances, coordinating disclosure of vulnerabilities can be a challenge. At times it can feel like everyone involved in CVD has conflicting motivations. The truth is that all of us are aspiring to do the right thing for end-users based on our perspective. The panel will share experiences and show how researchers and technology companies can work together to improve the impact of disclosing vulnerabilities on the technology ecosystem. Join CRob (Red Hat), Lisa Bradley (Dell), Katie Noble (Intel), Omar Santos (Cisco), Anders Fogh (Intel) and Daniel Gruss (TU Graz) for an exciting and engaging dialog between security researchers and industry experts on the Joy of coordinating vulnerability disclosure.'
