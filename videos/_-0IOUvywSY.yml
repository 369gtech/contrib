title: 'YOW! Lambda Jam 2021 - Daniel Spiewak - Journey to the Centre of the JVM'
language: English
recordingDate: 1628208776
description: "What do you do when your quest for power leads you to implementations which are not just platform- but processor- and even architecture-version-specific in nature? How do you even start tracking down a bug in a Scala-based implementation which is not only non-deterministic but only manifests on certain hardware? In this talk, we will dive into the wild and ill-understood world of CPU architecture, memory models, and JVM intrinsics (all through the lens of very high-level purely functional abstractions!) as we examine the story of the most convoluted and mind-bending bug hunt of my entire career.\n\nDaniel is a software developer based out of Boulder, CO. Over the years, he has worked with Java, Scala, Ruby, C/C++, ML, Clojure, and several experimental languages. He currently spends most of his free time researching parser theory and methodologies, particularly areas where the field intersects with functional language design, domain-specific \nlanguages and type theory.\n\nFor more information on YOW!
