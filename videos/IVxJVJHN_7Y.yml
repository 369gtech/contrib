description: "A Google TechTalk, 2019/12/08, presented by Chris Solarski and hosted by Rupert Breheny.\nABSTRACT: Swiss-based designer and author Chris Solarski visited Google Zurich to share his sensory-design framework, which adapts the traditional craft of Old Masters for use in game design, virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) and cross reality (XR). The framework is an evolution of Chris’ influential books—‘Drawing Basics and Video Game Art’ (Watson-Guptil 2012) and ‘Interactive Stories and Video Game Art’ (CRC Press 2016)—and provides techniques for affecting the physical and emotional state of players. Chris’ work has been described as gaming’s equivalent to Robert McKee’s screenwriting classic 'Story' (ReganBooks 1997) and Joseph Campbell’s universal storytelling structure—demonstrating VR/AR's undeniable ability to rival, even surpass the expressive qualities of classical art forms. \n\nAbout the speaker: https://solarskistudio.com\n\nThe speaker acknowledges the copyright owners of the artworks and media featured in the presentation for purposes of commentary, criticism and scholarship under the Fair Use Doctrine.
