language: English
recordingDate: 1626380292
description: "Low code/no code solutions for creating mixed reality apps enables a wider range of creators to build apps using emerging technology. Microsoft PowerApps provides the opportunity to quickly build and share low-code apps. The platform has expanded to include mixed reality components made to view 3D models, measure in mixed reality, and view models in mixed reality. In this session, April shares her experience with creating a prototype of an interior design app that uses the mixed reality components. Interested in giving PowerApps a try? Join this session to learn how you can get started with Microsoft PowerApps and mixed reality.\n\n\nApril Speight is a Sr. Cloud Advocate with the Spatial Computing technical team at Microsoft. She began her career in the luxury fashion industry as a menswear stylist and visual merchandiser and later transitioned into tech as a project manager. In her spare time as a project manager, she began learning the Python programming language and created educational content to help others learn. Through learning Python, she found a love for AI assistants and chatbots. Her love of the Python language and educating others led to the opportunity to publish her first book with Wiley titled Bite-Size Python: An Introduction to Python Programming, which will be available online and in stores late Summer 2020. In 2019, she was introduced to XR and approached the new technology with the same passion she held for Python. In January 2020, her team won Best in Learning, Education and Research as well as Best in Health and Wellness + Medical at the MIT Reality Hack for their VR learning experience Spell Bound, created to help children with dyslexia and dysgraphia learn letter formation and word recognition. She has since been helping the beginner XR community get started with creating their own experiences."
