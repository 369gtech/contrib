description: "6th Annual Google Test Automation Conference 2011 (GTAC 2011)\r\n\"Cloudy With A Chance Of Tests\"\r\nComputer History Museum\r\nMountain View, CA USA\r\nOctober 26-27, 2011\r\n\r\nPresented by Misko Hevery.\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nAngular teaches your old browser new tricks. It is what HTML would have been had it been designed for building web-applications. Angular is radical because it eliminates boilerplate code with declarative rather than imperative syntax.\r\n\r\nAngular:\r\n* Allows you to create custom HTML elements and attributes that provide dynamic behavior \r\n* Declaratively describe web-applications behavior with little JavaScript.  \r\n* Creates an environment that provides trivially reusable widgets, data-binding, \"automatic MVC\", server resources, and other primitives useful in building AJAX apps.\r\n* Builds apps that have orders of magnitude less JavaScript than equivalent apps written in classical way. \r\n* Eliminates waiting on compiling for UI changes.\r\n\r\nHaving an awesome framework is not enough, one needs to also have an awesome testability story. In this session we will focus on all of the work which we have done to make applications written in Angular a joy to test.\r\n\r\nMisko Hevery works as an Agile Coach at Google where he is responsible for coaching Googlers to maintain the high level of automated testing culture. This allows Google to do frequent releases of its web applications with consistent high quality. Previously he worked at Adobe, Sun Microsystems, Intel, and Xerox (to name a few), where he became an expert in building web applications in web related technologies such as Java, JavaScript, Flex and ActionScript. He is very involved in Open Source community and an author of several open source projects such as Angular (http://angularjs.org) and JsTestDriver (http://code.google.com/p/js-test-driver)."
