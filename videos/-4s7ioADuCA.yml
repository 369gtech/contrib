Ближайшая конференция — DotNext\_2020 Piter\n15-18 июня, Online\nПодробности и билеты: https://bit.ly/dotnext2020piter\n\n. Опытный спикер, который выступал на прошлом DotNext: [ссылка](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8O8rxJUqmY&index=26&list=PLtWrKx3nUGBfH5h9ago9ri5hxDT5HFH7I).*\n\nWe know it's useful to split up complex systems. We've seen the benefits of modular deployment of microservices. Dealing with only one piece of code at a time eases our cognitive load. But how do we know where to draw the service boundaries? In complex business domains, it's often difficult to know where to start. When we get our boundaries wrong, the clocks starts ticking. Before long, we hear ourselves say \"it would be easier to re-write it\".\n\nJoin Adam for practical advice on discovering the hidden boundaries in your systems. Help tease out the natural separation of concerns in a sample business domain. During 20 years of developing complex systems, Adam has had plenty of time to get things wrong. Learn to avoid the common pitfalls that can lead us down the path to \"the big re-write\"."
