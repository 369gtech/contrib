description: "DevConf - The Software Craftsmen Festival for Sharing Knowledge and Inspiration (https://devconf.pl/)\n\nAzure Functions is a key part of Microsoft serverless offering. At its core, it is a compute service, but its real power lies in integration capabilities. A lot has been said and written on how to use build in triggers and bindings to connect with databases, queues, web requests, and third-party APIs. There is however one aspect of Azure Functions which has been neglected - extensibility. This talk will walk you through Azure Functions extensibility with practical examples. It will give you the tools to push its integration capabilities further and get even more from Azure Functions."
