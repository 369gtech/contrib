title: 'Velocity NY 2013: Dany Rybnikov "Lightning Demo: Benchmarking Browsers'' Network Stack Performance"'
recordingDate: 1381947186
description: 'Browser performance is important especially on mobile devices where high latency network can have a major impact on the page load speed. Though many benchmarks exist to assess the performance of different browser components, most of them tend to minimize the network''s impact on the benchmark. So is there a way to benchmark the networking component as well? At Qualcomm we decided to create a benchmark tool that should answer exactly that question. This demo will show the benchmark in action, review its components and get a glance into differences in browsers performance that it can uncover.'
