description: "This video was recorded at Code Mesh LDN 18 http://bit.ly/2P7SPII\n\nGet involved in Code Sync's next conference http://bit.ly/2Mcm4aS\n\n---\n\nADDING KIND-POLYMORPHISM TO THE SCALA PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE\nby Miles Sabin\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nMoar\nPolymorphism\nFTW!\n\nTALK LEVEL: Advanced\n\nABSTRACT\nShapeless is the tool that people reach for when they have problems involving abstraction over data types of different shapes and sizes. But suppose we wanted to support this sort of data type generic programming directly in Scala? What sort of primitive mechanisms would we choose?\n\nIn this talk, Miles will argue that kind-polymorphism, the ability to abstract over type constructors of any arity, is one we should give serious consideration to. I will demonstrate a prototype implementation in the Typelevel compiler and show how it can be used to dramatically simplify generic programming in Scala.\n\nRead the full abstract: http://codesync.global/speaker/miles-sabin/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - MILES SABIN\nType astronaut, Typelevel co-founder and Shapeless hacker\n\nMiles has been doing stuff with Scala for more than a decade, currently with Underscore Consulting. He is a cofounder of Typelevel and his best known project, the Scala generic programming library shapeless, is the weapon of choice wherever boilerplate needs to be scrapped or arities abstracted over.\n\nMore on Miles Sabin: http://codesync.global/speaker/miles-sabin/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE MESH LDN 18\nCode Mesh LDN is powered by Code Sync.
