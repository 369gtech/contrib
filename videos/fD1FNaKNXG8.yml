title: 'Tanzu Tuesdays 55 - Orchestrating Data Pipelines with Data Flow with Glenn Renfro'
language: English
recordingDate: 1623213011
description: "With the quantity and types of data that must be processed in real time by enterprises today, we may be asking ourselves, “How do we create solutions to process this data and how do we orchestrate these solutions?” This discussion shows how Spring Cloud Data Flow (SCDF) can continuously deploy, scale, monitor, and manage your stream and batch workloads by using the capabilities on Kubernetes.\n\nThis session walks you through the tooling capabilities of SCDF. In addition to the core orchestration features, you will also see a demo of creating a real-time streaming pipeline on Kubernetes, using recipes such as functional composition of the applications, and managing workloads. You will also see a demo on scheduling and continuously deploying batch workloads on Kubernetes, creating a single-step batch job with no coding, and distributing batch job processing across multiple machines.\n\n---\nAs a VMware engineer, Glenn Renfro is a core committer for Spring Cloud Task, Spring Batch, and Spring Cloud Data Flow. He has 14 years of experience in designing, building, and delivering enterprise-level applications in Java and 21 years total of software development experience.\nhttps://twitter.com/cppwfs\nhttps://github.com/cppwfs"
