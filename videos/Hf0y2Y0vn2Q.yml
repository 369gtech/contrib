description: "Many Artificial Intelligence tools are difficult to implement and require dependency on closed vendor solutions. Linux Foundation Deep Learning Foundation (LFDL) was established to democratize AI. Acumos AI is one of the projects developed as part of LFDL, it is the first tool to give users a visual workflow for designing AI and machine-learning applications, as well as a marketplace for freely sharing AI models. In this session, Dr. Eyal Felstaine, Governing board member of the Linux foundation Deep Learning will walk you through the LFDL activity and projects, including Acumos AI distributed platform, explaining its benefits, including how it will free up data scientists, developers and model trainers across different industries and fields, (from network and video analytics, to content curation and threat prediction) so they can focus on their core competencies and accelerate innovation.\n\nVisit the largest developer playground in Europe!\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/wearedevelopers\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/WeAreDevs\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/_wearedevelopers/\n\n#WeAreDevs"
