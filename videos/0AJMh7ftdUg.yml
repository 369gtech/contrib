title: 'Demystifying Constraint Layout - James Williams - Codemotion Milan 2017'
recordingDate: 1511952358
description: 'ConstraintLayout has had the reputation of being very powerful but difficult to learn. Too many times have I talked to developers who were reluctant to use it in their designs because it was "too magical" and they couldn''t understand what it was doing. Despite the learning curve, ConstraintLayout allows you to make your designs more responsive and ultimately make your UI code faster to render. It also includes some design features that allow you to more accurately implement your designer''s work. In this session, you''ll learn how to make sense of the features of ConstraintLayout.'
