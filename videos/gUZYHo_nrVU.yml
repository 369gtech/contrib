title: 'YOW! Lambda Jam 2013 - Manuel Chakravarty - Do Extraterrestrials Use Functional Programming?'
recordingDate: 1380542784
description: "Is functional programming just the result of clever language design? Are there deeper reasons for the effectiveness of the paradigm? Why has functional programming not caught on earlier?\n\nIn this talk, we will have a look at the roots of functional programming, at their contribution to the success of the paradigm, and at the lessons we can draw to maximise the benefit we derive from functional languages. I will argue that the core of functional programming is a principled approach to software design compatible with both rigorous and agile methods of software development. It stems from a desire for purity, composability, and elegant logical properties, and I will outline how to leverage these ideas to solve practical programming problems.\n\nFor more on YOW!
