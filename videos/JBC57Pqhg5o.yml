Kim brings Mariesa, the author of “Hippocratic Oath for Technologists” and Daniel Jones, a strong advocate and ally for inclusivity, and Barb Darrow, veteran tech journalist who now covers innovation for Oracle, to discuss the ethical oath we need to take, the origins of the Hippocratic Oath, and the steps that must be taken to drive ourselves down a more ethical path.\n\nAbout Daniel Jones\nDaniel Jones is CTO of UK Cloud Foundry consultancy EngineerBetter, who have been improving value-delivery at the world’s largest banks, global wealth management firms, FTSE 100 retailers, governments and non-profit organizations.
