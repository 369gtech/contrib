description: "The Developer Experience – Zero to Hero - Jai Schniepp, Liberty Mutual\n\nDevelopers are integral to delivering on a company’s core business strategy, what often goes over looked is the amount of time they spend on non-value-added work. With introduction of Cloud Foundry, development teams are able to focus on business features and not the infrastructure—but that doesn’t resolve all the problems. Learn how Liberty Mutual has committed to our development teams. We work across the organization to deliver an end to end platform that offers a DevOps experience, focuses on ease of use, embedded security and abstraction. We use terms like developer experience, empathy and user-centered design because we understand if a developer is stuck in a process, our value is zero.\n\nAbout Jai Schniepp\nJai is the Director of Product for Secure DevOps Platforms at Liberty Mutual. Armed with a BS in Marketing and an MBA, she’s got the coveted soft skills her Information Technology peers long for—she’s outspoken, expressive and action-oriented. Her entire career is based on managing and building technical products from a non-technical perspective. She’s a product maven and an agile pro who's spent over a decade partnering with like-minded practitioners to introduce CI/CD practices, cloud native solutions, and deliver products that drive developers further up the value line. Customer point of view and the developer experience are her everything--yet she still wants to be an astronaut.\n\nhttps://www.cloudfoundry.org/"
