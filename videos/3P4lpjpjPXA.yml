language: English
recordingDate: 1544209887
description: "Many small engineering organizations, while trying to build products as quickly as possible, find themselves realizing the consequences of incurring technical debt. Different teams may choose incompatible technologies, using what is familiar to enable fast initial development. This becomes hard to maintain and introduces expensive context switching between projects.\n\nAs the number of teams grow, there comes a point when strategic investments in platform and tooling need to be made. Having a consistent technical stack across products and services is easier to support and allows for better collaboration. But engineers are opinionated, bikeshedding is real, and it can be hard to reach consensus when teams have leveraged competing technologies.\n\nPulling from examples of the successes and failures of the Web Platform team at Uber, this discussion will explore ways to build frameworks and libraries that increase productivity and maintain developer happiness by creating a seductive platform.\n\nNotes:\nhttps://github.com/fitcevents/webu-2016/blob/master/Seductive%20Platform.md\n\nFITC produces events for digital creators in Toronto, Amsterdam, NYC and beyond\nSave 10% off any of our events with discount code 'youtube'\n\nCheck out our events at http://fitc.ca\nor follow us at https://twitter.com/fitc"
