title: 'Building for Performance with Spring Integration & Spring Batch'
recordingDate: 1367346565
description: "Recorded at SpringOne 2GX 2012 in Washington, DC\nSpeaker: Andrew Elmore\nSpring Integration & Spring Batch greatly simplify the process of developing enterprise integration architectures and messaging systems. This session covers architectural patterns and real world examples showing how comprehensive the capabilities of Spring Integration & Batch are, while being lightweight enough to be suitable for very high performance environments.\n \nAt C24 we work closely with a large number of major financial institutions to help them architect high volume, low latency, scalable messaging systems. It's always great fun showing a client how a handful of Spring Integration configuration files can replace large chunks of their existing codebase, typically closing dozens of bugs in the process. Moreover, the resulting design is cleaner with a consistent approach to monitoring, error handling & processing. Spring Batch allows large file processing to be wired into the same flows usually with substantial improvements in throughput.\n\nWe'll review how to maximise performance while ensuring application robustness for mission critical usage."
