description: "CRD-ifying Cloud Foundry for Kubernetes - Angela Chin & Connor Braa, VMware \n\nFor more info: https://www.cloudfoundry.org/ \n\nOver the past year, there has been major effort invested in re-platforming Cloud Foundry to run on Kubernetes. As part of this re-architecture, the idea of utilizing Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) has come to the forefront of discussion. In this session, Angela and Connor will examine why CRDs are so compelling to use as a core component of the future cf-for-k8s. We will highlight the benefits of a CRD-centric approach for users, application developers, and contributors and offer some thoughts on what a CRD-centric cf-for-k8s might look like. Attendees should leave with a strong understanding of why and how they might utilize CRDs."
