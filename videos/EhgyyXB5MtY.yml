description: "Julie Kohler joins Scott Hanselman and shows you how you can generate an isochrone using Azure Maps. Isochrones represent the reachable range from a given point using a set of constraints such as fuel, energy or time. These polygons can be combined with a number of features to do things like search for gas stations within a given range or find restaurants within 15 minutes given current traffic conditions.\n\nFor more information, see:\n\nRoute Matrix, isochrones, IP lookup, and more added to Azure Maps (blog)\nhttps://aka.ms/azfr/480/01\n\nAzure Maps overview\nhttps://aka.ms/azfr/480/02\n\nAzure Maps docs\nhttps://aka.ms/azfr/480/03\n\nAzure Maps pricing\nhttps://aka.ms/azfr/480/04\n\nAzure Maps Functional API reference docs\nhttps://aka.ms/azfr/480/05\n\nCreate a free account (Azure)\nhttps://aka.ms/azfr/free"
