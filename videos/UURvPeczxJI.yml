description: "Pandas can be tricky, and there is a lot of bad advice floating around. This talk will cut through some of the biggest issues I've seen with Pandas code after working with the library for a while and writing two books on it.\n\nDo you struggle writing Pandas code?\n\nDo you spend too much time trying to understand code that you have previously written?\n\nWould you like to write code that your colleagues can easily understand and use?\n\nOur speaker, Matt Harrison, has been using Python since 2000. He runs MetaSnake, which provides corporate training for Python and Data Science. He is the author of Machine Learning Pocket Reference, the bestselling Illustrated Guide to Python 3, and Pandas Cookbook 1.x, among other books.\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nPyData provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish PyData talks.\n\nCREDITS:\nPyData YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOjD18EJYcsBog4IozkF_7w"
