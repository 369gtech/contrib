description: "Alec Clews\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/184/\n\nAn introduction to Docker for developers and testers who have never used it.\r\n\r\nDocker is a popular technology but it is often confusing for the novice. This talk makes no assumptions about prior Docker knowledge and takes the student through the basic concepts and terminology. Along the way  attendees will learn how to build images, run containers, map ports and create mounts. Finally Docker Compose is introduced.\r\n\r\nPlease make sure you install Docker **before** the workshop by\r\nfollowing the setup information at:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dockerfornovices/DockerSimpleDemo/wiki/SetUp\r\n\r\nThanks to @bretfisher and @jpetazzo for writing these setup instructions and saving me a lot of time.\r\n\r\nIf you have problems before the workshop ping me on twitter as @alecthegeek.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
