description: "Bridging the gap between on-prem and cloud: a story about Envoy + a hybrid boundary - Tristan J Blease, Groupon + Michael Chang, Groupon\_\n\nGroupon operates regional data centers where our product and platform engineering teams deploy and manage over 600 microservices on-premise. This year marks the start of our journey to migrate these microservices to the cloud where we expect them to run alongside our existing on-premise deployments. \n\nLike many others on similar journeys, we have an important problem to solve: how do we enable traffic to cross our new hybrid boundaries?\n\nFrom the previous usage, we know that Envoy can play a pivotal role in solving this problem, but what other components would be needed? How can we create a fully automated system that deeply integrates with our on-premise environments, which currently lack automation in key places? For this project to be successful, we have to answer these questions and more.\n\nJoin us to learn how Groupon is answering these questions and to learn how we are rolling out a fully automated system of edge proxies leveraging Envoy and other technologies for traffic management."
