description: "Burning Down the House: How to Plan for and Deal with Disaster Recovery in CF - Therese Stowell & Henry Stanley, Pivotal\n\nPeople make mistakes. Hardware fails. Hurricanes, volcanoes, acts of God. You’ve installed Cloud Foundry and are running 1000 mission-critical apps. You’re the operator and the health of CF is on your head, how do you sleep at night? \n\nBackups? But.. is backup an outdated term in a cloud native world? What does it mean to back up Cloud Foundry? What components are involved? What about data services? \n\nIn this talk Therese and Henry will dig into CF internals to map out what’s required to make reliable backups of Cloud Foundry and app data. They will talk through the challenges of engineering a robust b+r solution that works across IaaSs. They will look at different tools and approaches in use now, and discuss issues like downtime and consistency across multiple components. Finally they will present their proposed BOSH-based framework for backup and recovery plus other potential solutions, from disk imaging to event streams, while considering potential modifications to CF to make it more backup-able.\n\nAbout Henry Stanley\nSoftware Engineer, Backup & Restore, Pivotal\n\nAbout Therese Stowell\nTherese Stowell is Product Manager at Pivotal.
