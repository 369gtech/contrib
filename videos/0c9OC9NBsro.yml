title: 'The Frontend Is A Full Stack'

recordingDate: 1504709800
description: "Today's frontends embody the UI, the View Logic, some Business Logic and some Storage. This is a Full Stack on its own, on the client. Modern, component-oriented UI frameworks, together with state-action paradigms (like Flux and its most popular implementation, Redux) have formalized a lot of new concepts. And this radically changes the way we think our architecture.\n\nEVENT: Full Stack Fest, 2016\n\nSPEAKER: Luca Marchesini\n\nPERMISSIONS: The original video was published on Codegram Technologies YouTube channel with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nORIGINAL VIDEO: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtURpqTgtUs"
