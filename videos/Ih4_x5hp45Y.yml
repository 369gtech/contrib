description: "How do you grow an open source software project? How do you get to 100 contributors, 1,000 community members, 10,000 users or 100,000 downloads? How do you make it wildly successful?\n\nI’ve helped cultivate wildly successful open source communities on sparse budgets. Today, I want to share with you the rules I follow to build open source projects and communities.\n\nOpen Source works because it’s the right way. Open Source works because it’s the best way. There are no secrets that, once revealed, bring it all crashing down. Even with the cards face up on the table, we still feel good when someone thanks us for our contribution. When they don’t, we might decide to vote with our feet and leave.\n\nAttend this talk to learn everything you need to know about Open Source to make your community building efforts wildly successful."
