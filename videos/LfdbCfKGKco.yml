description: "Using BERT for abstractive text summarization on a small, curated corpus\n\nAbstract:\nMachine Learning provides a myriad of exciting new ways to extract and analyze data from the ever growing number of information sources we have today. While the internet indeed provides vast amounts of high-quality data, a lot of information is still enclosed in documents, and PDF documents in particualr. To unlock their potential, OCR and other information retrieval tools already provide a convenient way to extract knowledge from well structured files. An obstacle remains in the realm of tables: the format in which most quantitive information in documents are stored. And tables, while they can be extracted, usually only make sense in the context of their original document. In this talk, I'm going to share my experience working on a project to automatically compose informative table titles, using the powerful NLP model BERT, and connect the task to generative abstractive text summarization, for a specialized domain with limited amounts of data.\n\n\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
