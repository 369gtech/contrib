description: "Minimalism versus Types An experience report on the development of Titan, a statically-typed Lua-like language\nby Hisham Muhammad\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/K.4.201/minimalismversustypes.webm\n\n\nWe love minimalistic languages because they let us do so much with so little.\nBut when we start doing a lot with them, often we start yearning for types to help us make sense of it all.\nAdding types to a minimalistic language (well, adding anything!) makes it larger.\nIs this worth the price? Is a rich type system antithetical to minimalism? Let's find out! \n\nThis talk is based on the experiences in the development process of Titan, a statically-typed Lua-like language. \n\nRoom: K.4.201\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 12:25:00+01"
