title: 'Making Monitoring UIs Suck Less'

description: "Google Tech Talk\r\nFebruary 26, 2009\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nPresented by Conrad Albrecht-Buehler.\r\n\r\nTechnology users are technology observers as well: monitoring for problems or opportunities that might arise.  Designing interfaces to support the monitoring of technology presents unique challenges: from detecting situations to responding to situations, to changing the tools to match a changing operating environment or the changing knowledge of the observer.\r\n\r\nI present \"Heed\": a scale and framework to help observers of a system evaluate which situations need scrutiny and when, along with an example heed-based interface that encourages the development of situation awareness.  I discuss how the framework and interface can be applied to four different situations: server performance, a business's finances, user experience in a community forum, and the risk of disease outbreak at a veterinary clinic.\r\n\r\nConrad Albrecht-Buehler is always on the look-out for new and challenging user problems to explore and design remedies for.  He received his Ph.D. at Northwestern University studying human-computer interaction with Don Norman, and is now adjunct faculty at Northwestern's Segal Design Institute teaching user-centered design.  His research focuses on interfaces for situation awareness and information visualization.  In his spare time, he designs products for stroke survivors and enjoys dog training."
