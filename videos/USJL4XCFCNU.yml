description: "In this episode, Christos Matskas (@ChristosMatskas) joins us to share the story of an interesting application he built using the Azure SDKs for .NET and Cognitive Services. We not only get an overview of creating custom vision models, but also a demo of the docker containers for cognitive services. Christos also shares how he was able to leverage .NET standard libraries to maximize code portability and re-use. \n\n[03:27] - Overview of Cognitive Services\n[05:05] - Discussing AI Visual Provision Sample App\n[06:40] - azure sdk for .net and .net standard\n[08:58] - Options for deploying a custom vision model\n[11:55] - container support for cognitive services\n[19:10] - High level architecture breakdown\n\nUseful Links\n\nCognitive Services \nhttps://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/directory/?WT.mc_id=ondotnet-channel9-cephilli\n\nCognitive Services in containers \nhttps://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/getting-started-with-azure-cognitive-services-in-containers/?WT.mc_id=ondotnet-channel9-cephilli\n\nVisual Azure Provisioning from a Whiteboard\nhttps://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/XamarinShow/Visual-Azure-Provisioning-From-a-Whiteboard?WT.mc_id=ondotnet-channel9-cephilli\n\nAI Visual Provision Sample App https://github.com/Microsoft/AIVisualProvision\n\n.NET Libraries for Azure \nhttps://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net"
