description: "After Netflix helped popularize microservices, you probably heard the architectural pattern labelled a boon. However, if your team is tasked with implementing the pattern it is too easy to find yourself in a place where you've significantly increased your architectural complexity without deriving any of the benefits that microservices purport to bring, especially if implemented without proper organizational maturity or careful foresight and follow-through.\n\nThoughtWorks has led many teams and organizations along the path from monoliths to microservices and this presentation covers three of the major traps that weâ€™ve experienced (as well as how to avoid them). The traps covered are, underestimating the cost of a microservice, overcentralization, and neglecting the monolith."
