Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nChange is Hard - Securing the Future Today- Andrew Clay Shafer, Red Hat\n\nThe future of security is here now, but isn't evenly distributed. Change is inevitable, but resistance to change may be even more inevitable. What can we do to help organizations overcome the resistance to improve? The social engineering to solve is at least as hard as the technical challenges. This presentation will mix research and anecdote to discuss security as a socio-technical system recognizing the agency of the humans involved in addition to the technology advances that are driving the state of the art to solve security problems more holistically from first principles."
