title: 'What is an API?'
language: English
recordingDate: 1602904952
description: "When you start coding, you begin to see the word \"API\" a lot. Which is great. Because that's just what you always wanted - another TLA (three letter acronym). I remember when I first started my career I was confused by the concept of an API. What is an API? This code I'm using calls itself an API. And that website says it has an API. And this tutorial just said that I was writing an API. WHAT ISN'T AN API!?! In this session, we're going to demystify the idea of the API. Where did this phrase come from what does it really mean, and for goodness sakes, why does everything have to be an acronym?\n\nBuild Serverless APIs with Azure Functions: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/build-api-azure-functions/?WT.mc_id=8397-SDC-buhollan"
