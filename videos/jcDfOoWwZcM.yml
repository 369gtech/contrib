title: 'A more private way to measure ad conversions'
language: English
recordingDate: 1608084004
description: "The Chrome team is actively developing an API to recover a core ads use case without the need for third-party cookies: conversion measurement. This is the goal of attributing conversions (e.g. purchases) with prior ads engagement (e.g. ad clicks) for the purposes of measuring the performance of ads on the Web. We cover how the API works and what makes it more private than cookies.\n\nResources:\nEvent Conversion Measurement API → https://goo.gle/2KvhZ2c\nDemo: Event-level conversion measurement API → https://goo.gle/363BVBQ\nChrome Origin Trials → https://goo.gle/363XulL\nThird-party origin trials → https://goo.gle/3l1qIWs\nGitHub conversion measurement API → https://goo.gle/3m3r40d\n\nSpeaker: Charlie Harrison\n\nSubscribe to Google Chrome Developers here → https://goo.gle/ChromeDevs\nWatch all Chrome Developer Summit sessions here → https://goo.gle/cds20-sessions\n\n#chromedevsummit #chrome #advertisingAPI"
