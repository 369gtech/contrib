description: "by Vadim Markovtsev\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/H.2213/ml_on_code_code_review_suggestions.webm\n\n\nMany developers hate doing code reviews. Reading foreign code is hard, and suggesting improvements is even harder. Yet a dramatic portion of code review time goes to figuring out the boring details: formatting, naming, microoptimizations and best practices. We believe that all of those can be automated with ML on Code, either learning from a particular project or from all the open source code in the world which is relevant. This talk will be about open source \"analyzers\" - ML-driven code review agents which deal with the boring but important details. \n\nRoom: H.2213\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 09:50:00+01"
