description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTOpia November 2020. #GOTOcon #GOTOpia\nhttp://gotopia.eu\n\nPaulien van Alst - Passionate Software Engineer at OpenValue Teaching Kotlin\n\nABSTRACT\nMost of the Java applications are written in Java 8 nowadays and people are looking around to upgrade to Java 11 or even migrating to Kotlin. Both are promoted as the new way to go and both have their own strengths and weaknesses. Upgrading to Java 11 might be an obvious next safe step to do. But what if you could migrate to Kotlin with the same effort? This would bring you additional advantages like: data classes, very concise list manipulations, extension functions, DSL's and even more to get your code more readable and maintainable.\nConsidering the Kotlin migration, the first questions that pop up are: What are the wise steps to take? And where to start? Some experiences and thoughts answering these questions will be shared [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n00:48 My story with Kotlin\n02:47 Who am I?\n03:34 Highlights Java 9/10/11+\n04:43 Reasons to switch to Kotlin\n08:19 What to keep in mind\n10:03 Let's start!\n11:20 Migration plan\n12:38 Demo\n35:40 Migration plan continued\n36:00 Welcome on board/Outro\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotopia.eu/november-2020/sessions/1630/upgrade-time-choose-java-11-or-the-other-one-kotlin\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#Kotlin #Ktor #Coroutines #Micronaut #Java #Java11 #Java8 #Java9 #Java10 #ProgrammingLanguages #Programming\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
