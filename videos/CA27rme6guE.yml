title: 'Berta Devant - The Fake Problem with Junior Developers'
recordingDate: 1555663839
description: "There is a common misconception that junior developers are a burden and wonâ€™t be delivering value for the first months or even years. Yet after observing not only my own but other's contributions to teams while still being junior developers, I realised that even though our technical skills were still developing, our insights could prove useful to the teams from day one. \n\nIn this session, I want us to discuss some of these misconceptions and help juniors and teams alike understand the real value they can bring to a project or company. Because a good developer is worth hiring no matter their experience level."
