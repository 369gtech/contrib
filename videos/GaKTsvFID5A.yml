description: "Artificial Intelligence, machine learning, and autonomous vehicles are some of the hottest areas of research and business today. Talk about self-driving cars, and the names Uber, Tesla, Waymo, Volvo and NVIDIA come to mind. \n\n\n\nEmploying a massive number of Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques to enhance their products, models and autopilot capabilities, these companies are at the forefront of autonomous vehicle technology, deployment, and adoption. \n\n\nDonkey Car is an open source hobbyist project powered by volunteers with a shared interest to build their own self driving car and is currently one of the most popular self-driving car repositories on Github.  \n\n\nUtilizing high-level self driving libraries written in Python, Donkey was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation and easy contribution. Built on Raspberry Pi and powered by a simple convolutional neural network (CNN), Donkey Car is the standard hardware car that most people build first. The parts cost about USD250 to USD300 and take 2 hours to assemble however you can do everything you’d normally do in The Donkey Gym! An OpenAI virtual environment for you to build, test and deploy your AI networks. \n\n\n=== \n\n\nJonathan Tse is the project maintainer of the open source Donkey Car project. He is also the founder of robocarstore.com, the official store selling Donkey Car Starter Kit for people who want to build their own self-driving car. He believes that AI education should be for everyone and AI should be made easier to learn for students. He is actively promoting Donkey Car to K12 schools and designed a curriculum suitable for K12 students.\n\n\n--- \n\n\nDhillon Andrew Kannabhiran (@l33tdawg on Twitter) is the Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Hack in The Box (http://www.hitb.org), organiser of the HITBSecConf series of network security conferences which has been held annually for over a decade in various countries including Malaysia, The Netherlands and the UAE.\n\n\nPrior to quitting his day job to lead the HITB team on crazy adventures around the world, Dhillon started off at the height of the dotcom craze as a technology journalist with PC World, ZDnet, MIS Asia and CNet. When the bubble burst, he moved on to a Malaysian telco as Chief IT Officer to spend his days in the world of Cisco AS5300s, in a land of packet switched networks at a time when Asterisk did not just mean ‘*’"
