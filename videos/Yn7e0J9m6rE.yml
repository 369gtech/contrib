description: "Google Tech Talks\r\nJuly 1, 2010\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nPresented by Randy Farmer.\r\n\r\n*This talk is ideal for system architects, PMs, community managers, UI designers and anyone working on social initiatives.*\r\n\r\nWhat do Amazon's product reviews, eBay's feedback score system, Slashdot's Karma System, and Xbox Live's Achievements have in common? They're all examples of successful reputation systems that enable consumer websites to manage and present user contributions most effectively. Randy will talk about these examples and why reputation systems are critical for any organization that draws from or depends on user-generated content. \r\n\r\n\"Randy\" Farmer has been creating online community systems for over 30 years, and has co-invented many of the basic structures for both virtual worlds and social software. His accomplishments include numerous industry firsts (such as the first virtual world, the first avatars, and the first online marketplace). Randy worked as the community strategic analyst for Yahoo!, advising Yahoo properties on construction of their online communities. Randy was the principal designer of Yahoo's global reputation platform and the reputation models that were deployed on it.\r\n\r\nSlides available at http://www.slideshare.net/soldierant/5-reputation-missteps-and-how-to-avoid-them"
