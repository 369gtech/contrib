description: "CF-Motion: Live Migration of Cloud Foundry Applications and Data [I] - Xuebin He & Thinh Nguyen, Dell EMC    \n\nCloud Foundry can provide application portability across multiple Cloud Foundry instances. Developers can push applications to different Cloud Foundry instances easily. However, data and services have traditionally tied applications to a Cloud, limiting application portability. With CF-Motion, applications and data can now migrate across multiple Cloud Providers with minimum to no downtime. In this talk, Xuebin and Thinh will walk through design and architecture of CF-Motion with a demo.\n\nXuebin He\nSoftware Engineer, Dell EMC\nCloudFoundry Contributor, working at Dell EMC Dojo focusing on research and advanced development. @hexuebin0201\n\nThinh Nguyen\nSoftware Engineer, Dell EMC"
