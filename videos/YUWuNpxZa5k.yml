description: "We have learned to avoid repeating ourselves in code, and yet we keep writing things like:\n\n\n\nIn this session I will show techniques from modern C++ that helps you construct abstractions for those micro repetitions. These will allow you to write:\n\n\n\nCode like this expresses intent more clearly, and therefore makes it easier to follow the logic of the intended functionality instead of focussing on code details. This makes it easier to understand the functionality, and also makes it easier to spot mistakes. Better yet, these abstractions carry no run time\ncost.\n\nAfter this session, you will be able to write your own zero-cost abstractions that helps getting rid of the patterns that keeps repeating in your code.\n\nSave the date for NDC TechTown 2020  (31st of August - 3rd of September)\n\nCheck out more of our talks at: \nhttps://ndctechtown.com/\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/"
