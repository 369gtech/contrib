description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM SF 2020 - http://bit.ly/2wpn0SM\n\nGet involved in Code Sync's next conference - https://codesync.global\n\n---\n\nGEORACER: BUILDING A REAL-TIME MULTIPLAYER MOBILE GAME IN ELIXIR IN 6 WEEKS.\nby Zack Kayser and Beau Heubach\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nElixir LiveView Real-Time\n\nABSTRACT\nPhoenix Phrenzy was an app building competition to show off a brand-new feature in the Phoenix web framework called LiveView. LiveView allows developers to build dynamic, real-time web interfaces using only Elixir. Our team wanted to push the boundaries of LiveView, so we built a geo-location based racing game we called GeoRacer and were delighted when our app won. In this session, we'll share the story of building GeoRacer and show how LiveView can give you web app building super powers.\n\nSlides & full abstract: \n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - ZACK KAYSER\nElixir Evangelist Everywhere\n\nZack is a software engineer at Gaslight in Cincinnati, Ohio, and has spent the last couple of years working on a wide variety of projects -- ranging from server-side applications, to iOS and web frontend enterprise applications, to one-day hackathon projects, all the way to game development for personal enjoyment (and pain :-D). Ever since being introduced to Elixir, Erlang, and OTP in 2016, he has been a huge proponent of functional programming and an evangelist for a movement towards more immutability and no shared state wherever possible. Prior to entering the software industry, he was a professional translator specialising in English to Japanese translation. \n\nOutside of work, Zack is an avid traveler.\n\nMore on Zack Kayser: https://codesync.global/speaker/zack-kayser/.\n\nTHE SPEAKER - BEAU HEUBACH\nPixel Pushing User Advocate\n\nBeau is a UX designer, front-end developer, and father of six with 15 years of experience working to solve complex usability problems and learning how to measure user experience.
