It excels in horizontal scalability and can easily scale to 100+ terabytes of data.&lt;br &lt;br In this talk, Yi Wu will take a deep dive into the architecture of TiKV and the recent development of the TiKV project. Additionally, they will introduce the new Titan storage engine and multithreaded raft store introduced in TiKV 3.0 in-depth and detail how the new features helped TiDB serve 1.6 trillion rows and more than 200 terabytes of data within a single cluster.\n\nhttps://sched.co/bRVh"
