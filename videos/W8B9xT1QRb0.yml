recordingDate: 1368732378
description: "SoundCloud has 30 million registered users, 10 hours of audio is uploaded every minute, and since the end of last year has transitioned their entire site to a single page Javascript application using Backbone.js. This didn't come easy. So, Darrell Stephenson visited HTML5DevConf to talk about the troubleshooting that went into the implementation for a site with a large, and growing, online community.\n \nThis talk is geared towards the developer who is using, or is interested, in Backbone.js. Darrell shows some of the issues that his team faced while re-imagining the site as a single page app, how they addressed these concerns, and uses examples from the SoundCloud page."
