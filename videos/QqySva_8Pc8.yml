description: "12 million developers across 80% of the enterprise, run Java. It is the #1 language in the world, yet when it comes to serverless, rarely seen in the top 3. Why? I will review some of the recent improvements to the language, platform, and ecosystem, as well as offer a glimpse into upcoming features targeting both developer productivity and program performance while retaining Javaâ€™s core values of readability and compatibility. Come away with confidence that your Java skills can be applied to the next generation of serverless workloads.\n\nAbout:\nChad Arimura, VP Serverless - Oracle\n\nI am a 3x entrepreneur, most recently as co-founder and CEO of Iron.io where we grew a multi-million dollar ARR business helping pioneer serverless computing including some of the earliest usages of the term \"serverless\" in 2010. Sorry for that. We sold the company in 2017 and joined Oracle. I am now Vice President of Serverless at Oracle, currently leading The Fn Project, open source serverless FaaS platform and orchestration."
