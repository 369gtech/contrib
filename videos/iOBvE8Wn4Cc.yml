recordingDate: 1404936002
description: "Originally recorded April 29, 2014. Don Coleman, Tom Igoe, and Brian Jepson (authors of Beginning NFC ) will introduce you to Near Field Communication using Android phones, Arduino, and NFC readers for computers and Arduino. Learn how information on NFC tags is stored and retrieved, how to write applications on Arduino and Android to read and write tags, and how to integrate NFC into larger projects. Two demos in this session will feature :\n\nReading a tag with an Android PhoneGap application\nWriting to a tag from Arduino\nAnd when both are done, we'll be able to show you how an Android device can read the tag you wrote from Arduino and take an action based on the data you stored.\n\nAbout Don Coleman:\nDon Coleman is a software developer who enjoys hacking with phones, Arduino and other hardware. At Chariot Solutions, a consulting company near Philadelphia, he works with teams and clients to reinvent their existing technology and lay the groundwork for the future. Don is the co-author of \"Beginning NFC Near Field Communication with Arduino, Android, and PhoneGap\" and is currently working on a book about Bluetooth Low Energy.\n\nAbout Tom Igoe:\nTom Igoe likes playing with electronics, mechanics, and programming, making things that let people express themselves, and unusual clocks. He has written two books for makers, Physical Computing with Dan O'Sullivan, and Making Things Talk, and is a contributor to Make magazine. He teaches at the Interactive Telecommunications Program at NYU. He is a co-founder of Arduino because he believes that open fabrication can change the world. He is a fan of women's flat-track roller derby and lives in Brooklyn with a cat named Noodles. He is currently realizing his dream of working with monkeys, and wants to visit Svalbard someday.\n\nAbout Brian Jepson:\nBrian Jepson is an editor with Maker Media (publisher of MAKE magazine) and co-organizer of Providence Geeks and the Rhode Island Mini Maker Faire. He's also been involved in various ways over the years with AS220, a non-profit arts center in Providence, Rhode Island. AS220 gives Rhode Island artists uncensored and unjuried forums for their work and also provides galleries, performance space, fabrication facilities, and live/work space.\n\nDon't miss an upload!
