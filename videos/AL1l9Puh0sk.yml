What is MariaDB all about, and what is its future?\n\nWhat can you do with new features added in the first GA release of MariaDB 5.1, such as additional Storage Engines (Maria, PBXT, XtraDB, FederatedX), faster complex queries, pools of threads, speed improvements, extensions (more index parts, new startup options, etc.), table elimination, slow query log extended statistics, and more?\n\nMonty Widenius is the founder of MySQL(R) AB, and the original author & architect of MySQL(R) Database Server. Monty has founded Monty Program Ab and hired many of the top core developers of the database to create MariaDB, a backward compatible, drop-in replacement branch of MySQL(R) Database Server, in collaboration with the community."
