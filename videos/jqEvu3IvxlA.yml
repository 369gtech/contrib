description: "“Why’d you have to go and make things so complicated?” - Avril Lavigne, implementing Angular forms in 2019\n\nForms are such a basic part of web applications; how did they get so complicated? This talk will walk through Angular template driven vs. reactive forms and use cases for their implementation, basic & more complex form-validation, & custom component implementations like typeahead and date-pickers. This talk will also include some useful workarounds for those more complex PITA requirements that always seem to pop up in projects.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks, courses, and conferences in the following links:\nhttps://ndcsydney.com/\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
