description: "Recorded at PyData SÃ¼dwest Meetup\nJoin us on meetup: https://www.meetup.com/PyData-Suedwest\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PyDataSW\n\nMaking Sense out of Sensor Data: Optimizing Energy Consumption of the Transalpine Oil Pipeline\n\nWe explain the key success factors of a concrete Data Science project with TAL-Group, which is the operator of the transalpine oil pipeline transporting about 45 millions of tons of crude oil every year across the alps. Based on the experiences made in that project we focus on two questions:\n1. How did we convert raw sensor data to a concrete Data science problem definition?\n2. How did Machine Learning algorithms help in order to identify root causes for efficiency losses while pumping raw oil?\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
