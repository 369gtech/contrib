description: "The act of discovering and displaying digital art created for 20th century computing and telecommunication environments places the character of these systems in stark relief. Most exhibitions require an archeological undertaking and an enormous effort to execute a single artifact from forty years ago.\n\nThe software I feature in this talk operated at the edge of digital systems. Artists often behaved like hackers: working off hours, pushing a system beyond its specification, and inventing new possibilities for human interaction along the way. They were some of the most eager practitioners of early computing but often found it difficult to obtain access. Their work often saw limited distribution and few updates.\n\nThese challenges exasperate the difficulty of building a retrospective of digital art. The software's brittle nature reflects the environment within which it ran. The engineering decisions that lead to these systems were often informed as much by culture as science. \"Misuer\" will illustrate this connection and build a framework to examine the value of conventions and what we can learn by working outside of them.\n\nSpeaker: David Schmudde"
