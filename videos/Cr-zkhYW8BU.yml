title: '#ChefConf 2014: Yvonne Lam, "Get Up Again (Over And Over): Learning And Relearning With Chef"--SFW'
recordingDate: 1400782874
description: 'One of the great things about Chef and its ecosystem is that things move fast. That is also one of the inconvenient things about Chef and its ecosystem. New tools, patterns, and ideas are coming out all the time that fix some problems, cause new ones, and bring into question previous approaches. This means that unless you are totally happy with your workflow, your infrastructure, and your processes (and who is?), you are going to keep refactoring and relearning. This talk is about how to do that: how to pick your battles if you don''t want to chase the new hotness all the time, how to structure experiments, and how to keep your code and infrastructure in shape so that you can try new things (and back them out if you hate them).'
