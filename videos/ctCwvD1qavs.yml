description: "Since APEX 18, external REST Services became a first-class data source for APEX applications. Web Source Modules allow to create create reports, Charts, Calendars or other components directly on top of the REST service - all low-level work, like making the HTTP request or parsing JSON will be done by APEX. This session walks through the architecture and demonstrates how Web Source Modules work with a public REST API from the internet.\n\n\nA recording provided by the awesome APEX community, that built a virtual 24 hour conference called APEX@Home held on April 16th 2019.\n\nWith 24 world renowned speakers and nearly 5000 virtual attendees, this event was a huge success.
