title: 'Chris Monnier: Travel Stories'
recordingDate: 1535399283
description: "In early 2017, Airbnb launched a feature that showcases travel stories from Airbnb users. Theses stories are an authentic portrayal of life in cities and towns around the world and inspire travelers as they dream about and eventually plan trips on Airbnb. These stories also give Airbnb hosts and guests an opportunity to express themselves creatively and share with the Airbnb community how their lives were affected by travel.\n\nThis talk will focus on the research that was conducted throughout Europe, China, and the US to determine how to design stories in a way that is interesting, helpful, and meaningful both to the users that consume stories and the users that create stories.\n- Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/amuse\n\nSave the date! Amuse will be back on October 16-18, 2019.\nhttp://amuseconf.com/"
