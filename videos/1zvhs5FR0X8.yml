description: "Colton McAnlis, Noel  Allen\n\nIn this talk, we will be porting an application to Native Client in 60 minutes, LIVE; showing the power of what Native Client can provide for traditional C++ developers looking to move to the web. In the porting process we'll cover specific tasks that a developer would need to perform during a port, and how to to address them with new tools and technologies including debugging integration with Visual Studio and a set of newly added utility libraries to the SDK.\n\nAttendees to this session will walk away with a clear understanding of what's required to port their applications to Native Client so that they can start their own projects\n\nFor all I/O 2012 sessions, go to https://developers.google.com/io/"
