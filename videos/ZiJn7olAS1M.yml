description: "Lightning Talk: Spawning Kubernetes In CI For Integration Tests - Marko Mudrinić, Loodse \n \nMaking sure a Kubernetes operator works correctly is a very important step before deploying it to production. Without good integration and E2E test coverage, it’s easy for a bug to get in.Therefore everybody who is seriously developing operators will face the problem of spawning Kubernetes in CI: integration tests assume a complete Kubernetes cluster. There are many solutions for bootstrapping clusters, but many of them don’t work in CI or require additional configuration.In this talk we’ll take a quick look at the most popular solutions for running Kubernetes in CI, such as Minikube and DIND. We’ll compare those solutions and see what the requirements for each of them are. \n\nTo learn more: https://sched.co/GrUv"
