Future data processing platforms will need to not just scale cost-effectively; but to allow ever more real-time analysis, and to support both simple queries and today's most sophisticated analytics algorithms. Through the Spark project at Apache and Berkeley, we've brought six years research to enable real-time and complex analytics within the Hadoop stack."
