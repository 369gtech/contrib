description: "Authentication and Authorisation can be tricky, with many different methods of performing similar tasks and it can be hard to figure out what's best for your projects. It gets even trickier when you start thinking about how to authorise cross platform applications including web and apps (and now with Xamarin thrown in, it's even murkier!).\nThrow in WebAPI2 on the other side and it's starting to become unclear how to make a great experience for developers and end users alike. In this session Jordan will demonstrate how to build a centralised authentication system that supports web and apps, passing claims around all over the place using Json Web Tokens ending up in a WebAPI2 based API site. The session will investigate a range of concepts from web to app to API, including best practices, Autofac powered filters, OWIN and other cool concepts that your services need!Any sample code, video, or other supporting content for this presentation (if available for this session) is loaded in the zip file."
