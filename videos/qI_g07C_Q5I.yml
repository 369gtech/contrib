description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2012\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nMartin Fowler - Author, Speaker, Consultant & General Loud-mouth on Software Development\n\nABSTRACT\nMartin gives a rapid introduction to NoSQL databases: where they came from, the nature of the data models they use, and the different way you have to think about consistency. From this he outlines what kinds of circumstances you should consider using them, why they will not make relational databases obsolete, and the important consequence of polyglot persistence.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
