description: "Talk from ChernivtsiJS #3, 10 June 2017 (chernivtsi.js.org)\n\nArtem Yavorsky, Hell Yeah LLC (Kyiv)\n\nI'm going to start with Babel 7 changes explanation. Then, let's meet our most powerful and flexible preset - babel-preset-env aka autoprefixer for Babel. I'll show how to decrease compilation time for development environment. How to compile for production with safety and get the lowest possible bundle size at the same time. I'll work through some gotchas like dealing with ES2015 code and UglifyJS. I will try to explain why you don't need to support Chrome 45 and Safari 6. And for an extra treat, I'll show how to build and serve user agent-specific bundles."
