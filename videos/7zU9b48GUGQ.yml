description: "Video recording of a presentation given at JDK IO conference in Copenhagen in June 2018 at the IT-University organized by the Danish Java User Group - Javagruppen.\n\nhttps://jdk.io/jdk-io-2018/speakers/222-ensar-basri-kahveci\n\nFrom AP to CP and Back: The Curious Case of Hazelcast\n\nSpeaker: Ensar Basri Kahveci\n\nDistributed databases employ replication to achieve performant, available, and fault tolerant solutions.\n\nHowever, managing replicated data is challenging.\n\nBuilding a distributed database is hard, and clarifying its high level properties is even harder.\n\nHazelcast makes use of several replication techniques together to offer choices for the trade-offs between consistency, availability, and latency properties.\n\nIn this talk, I take a closer look at these techniques, and discuss them from the perspective of the CAP and PACELC principles."
