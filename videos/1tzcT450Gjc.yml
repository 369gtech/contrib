To give you an example of its accuracy, it predicted a friend and colleague’s change of career days before he called and told me of his move!”\n\nBy mimicking the working of the human mind and simulating thought processes, AI has stepped out of the pages of science fiction to offer unparalleled guidance for this mission critical activity. In a world where the war for talent is ongoing, progressive companies are not questioning the use of cognitive computing but implementing it to gain first mover advantage and competitive edge.\n\nWith a Masters degree in Ethnography and Social Anthropology from the University of Aarhus, Denmark, Sören Leth-Nissen has profound understanding and insight into organizational dynamics, corporate culture and human behaviour. Together with nine other luminaries who connect the Mars landing to advanced robotics, identity management and access governance, Leth-Nissen will be speaking at GOTO Accelerate London 2016.\n\nThe conference programme is uniquely designed to provide CIO's and IT executives with thought provoking research and case studies from companies who have successfully implemented software to transform their business through the use of social platforms, mobile, analytics and big data. GOTO Accelerate London 2016 takes place on June 15th – 16th at East Wintergarden, One Canada Square, Canary Wharf, E14 5AB\n\nSign up here:  http://gotocon.com/accelerate-london-2016\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotoldn\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
