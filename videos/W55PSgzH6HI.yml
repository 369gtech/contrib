title: 'Polly McEldowney - Custom Layout Managers for RecyclerView'
recordingDate: 1554745232
description: 'Bored of straight lines? On the BBC Sounds app, we used a custom LayoutManager for RecyclerView to shape a list of radio stations into a circular dial. This talk will describe how to hook into this flexible and powerful Android API to showcase your collections in any configuration you want. I will lead you through the process I used, building up the custom view code incrementally, and designing the code for testability and accessibility.'
