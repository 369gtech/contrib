title: 'GopherCon 2020: Michael Knyszek - Evolving the Go Memory Manager''s RAM and CPU Efficiency'
language: English
recordingDate: 1608668654
description: "This talk will discuss recent changes to the Go memory manager, which improved both the runtimeâ€™s responsiveness in giving up unneeded memory and the scalability of the memory allocator. In this presentation, Michael peeks under the hood of the runtime, examines motivating examples, and recalls the bugs encountered in making it all work. He hopes to have advanced Gophers walk away with a new or updated understanding of how the Go runtime functions, as well as how these changes might impact the performance of their applications.\n\nA basic understanding of operating systems concepts is recommended, but the talk will briefly introduce any concepts as necessary."
