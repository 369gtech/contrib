However, Ethereum Certification Training is best suited for the below mentioned profiles:-\nSoftware Developers\nFull Stack Developers\n\nWhy you should go for this ethereum developer's course?\n\nEthereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third-party interference. These apps run on a custom built blockchain, an enormously powerful shared global infrastructure that can move value around and represent the ownership of property. This enables developers to create markets, store registries of debts or promises, move funds in accordance with instructions given long in the past (like a will or a futures contract) and many other things that have not been invented yet, all without a middleman or counterparty risk.\n\nUsing Ethereum, you can create a contract that will hold a contributor's money until any given date or goal is reached. Depending on the outcome, the funds will either be released to the project owners or safely returned to the contributors. All of this is possible without requiring a centralized arbitrator, clearinghouse or having to trust anyone. You can even use the token you created earlier to keep track of the distribution of rewards.\n\nFor more information, please write back to us at sales@edureka.co\nCall us at US: 18442306362 (toll free) or India: +919019117772"
