title: 'Agile embedded development under regulatory constraints - Espen Albrektsen - NDC TechTown 2021'
language: English
recordingDate: 1635790747
description: 'We have developed a wireless, low-power gas detector certified according to Functional Safety SIL2 (IEC61508). Developing software under regulatory constraints poses extra challenges. The standards have requirements for code quality, language features, software design, testing - and especially documentation. Trying to combine this with agile methods is a challenge. During this talk, we will present how we solved this in our project - and how we were able to minimize the rigidity of the standard and maximize our agility.'
