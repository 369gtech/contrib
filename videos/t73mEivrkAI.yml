recordingDate: 1628270649
description: "In Grokking Machine Learning, expert machine learning engineer Luis Serrano introduces the most valuable ML techniques and teaches you how to make them work for you. You’ll only need high school math to dive into popular approaches and algorithms. Practical examples illustrate each new concept to ensure you’re grokking as you go. You’ll build models for spam detection, language analysis, and image recognition as you lock in each carefully-selected skill. Packed with easy-to-follow Python-based exercises and mini-projects, this book sets you on the path to becoming a machine learning expert. When you’re done, you’ll have an intuitive understanding of the right approach for any machine learning task or project.\n\nCheck out Luis Serrano's book 📖 Grokking Machine Learning | http://mng.bz/1reV 📖 To save 40% off this book ⭐ DISCOUNT CODE: twitserr40 ⭐ Luis explains how deep reinforcement learning works, focusing on Q-networks and policy gradients, over a simple example.
