description: "Armands has been in the Information Technology industry for 9 years and currently is a solution architect in a recently founded company eBIT Ltd. His diverse professional interests span from SOA concepts and augmented reality to Agile practice implementation and usability.\n\nHe is also guest lecturer at Riga Technical University and Riga Business School.\n\nMaking most of Scrum and Kanban with Jira\nReal life case study focusing on \"\"why?\"\" and \"\"how?\"\" Scrum and Kanban were implemented side by side in several maintenance projects.\n\nThe reason for this presentation is the fact that Scrum is widely used for IT development, however maintenance projects struggle with Scrum due to unpredictable nature of workload and drop Agile practices altogether. However Kanban can be used along side Scrum to cover for the unpredictable nature of demand as well as expose bottlenecks in current processes. Presentation will also show how these process tools were implemented from an everyday work perspective using standard possibilities of Atlassian Jira."
