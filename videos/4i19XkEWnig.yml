description: "Mohammad Azam on AskTHAT Live! We talk AR, Education and everything development.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/azamsharp \nhttp://www.azamsharp.com\n\nMy name is Mohammad Azam and I have been developing iOS applications since 2010. I have worked as a lead mobile developer for VALIC, AIG, Schlumberger, Baker Hughes, Blinds.com and The Home Depot. I have also published tons of my own apps to the App Store and even got featured by Apple for my app, Vegetable Tree. I highly recommend that you check out my portfolio. At present I am working as a lead instructor at DigitalCrafts."
