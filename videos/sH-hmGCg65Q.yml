description: "Use the Cluster API to Deploy Clusters On-Prem and in Public Clouds - Loc Nguyen, VMware & Kris Nova, Heptio \n\nDeploying and managing kubernetes clusters has a reputation filled with stress and headaches. On top of this, there are dozens of tools, APIs and services available to use but they donâ€™t all interoperate. Some tools work best with on prem while others works best with a specific public cloud.  The Cluster API is a new project bringing in members from many of these well-known tools and members from both public clouds and on-prem infrastructure software providers. The goal is to create a common declarative, kubernetes-style API, tools, and best practices that can be used to create day-zero solutions for deploying kubernetes to multiple platforms. Come learn about the goals of this project and see a demo of it in use in both on-prem and in a public cloud. \n\nTo Learn More: https://sched.co/GrWT"
