description: "In this episode, Rick talks with Doug Sillars about the state of video on the web. Serving video may seem like a daunting task given the array of formats, codecs, browser support, player functionality, and hosting options. But, like images, there are simple best practices to ensure that there is a healthy balance between visual quality and the user experience (performance, accessibility, page weight, etc). Doug describes the best practices for including video on your page and some reasons you might actually *not* want to include video.\n\nMore info about everything discussed in this episode:\n2019 Web Almanac: https://goo.gle/36CQJFO\nStreamOrNot: https://goo.gle/32mpOKM\nThe Video Embed element: https://goo.gle/2JUOjsf\n\nThe State of the Web â†’ https://goo.gle/2nBiwEL\nSubscribe here: https://goo.gle/ChromeDevs"
