language: English
recordingDate: 1585652316
description: "Transfer learning has been called “NLP’s ImageNet moment”. Recent work has shown that models can be initialized with detailed, contextualized linguistic knowledge, drawn from huge samples of data. In this talk, I’ll explain spaCy’s new support for efficient and easy transfer learning, and show you how it can kickstart new NLP projects with our new annotation tool, Prodigy Scale.\n\nThe speech took place on 9th of May on Deeptech Stage during Infoshare 2019 in Gdansk, Poland.\n\n#Python #DeepTech #NLP #Tech"
