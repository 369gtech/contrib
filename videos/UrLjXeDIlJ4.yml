description: "This is a technical talk about the various compilation options that\nthe compiler hides in comments. In the talk, I'll go over 3-5 of the\nmost useful (some aren't useful at all, they can only be used inside\nthe runtime package), show some code demonstrating what they do and\nhow you can use them in your Go code."
