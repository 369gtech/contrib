description: "Build a Kubernetes Based Cloud Native Storage Solution From Scratch - Sheng Yang, Rancher Labs \n\nWhen it comes to cloud-native and container-ready storage, most industry discussions focus on how to make existing storage systems work with Kubernetes/Docker. But the rapid development of SSD technology, along with container and Kubernetes, make it possible to create a more elegant solution from scratch, compared to the storage technologies exist tens of years ago.\n\n So they have created a storage solution based on Kubernetes\n\n In Longhorn, control flow is driven by Kubernetes's controller model; deployment is done using Kubernetes workload; HA is backed by Kubernetes's HA capability. Though sometimes it's easy to say than done. As a result, lots of insights were gained on how to write an application based on Kubernetes. In this talk, Sheng Yang will give a talk about the experience and insights he has gained as a part of building a Cloud Native storage solution on Kubernetes. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPXK"
