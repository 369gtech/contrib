description: "This video was recorded at Code Mesh LDN 19 - http://bit.ly/37xc3Nr\n\nGet involved in Code Sync's next conference - http://bit.ly/2Mcm4aS\n\n---\n\nCONCURRENCY BEFORE ERLANG \nby Bjarne Däcker\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nConcurrency\nApplied research \nPrototyping\n\nTALK LEVEL: Intermediate\n\nABSTRACT\nThis talk covers (1) concurrent languages at Ericsson before Erlang, (2) imperative concurrent languages Modula, Chill and Ada (the last two large international efforts), (3) start of the Computer Science Lab at Ericsson and experimentation with language paradigms, and (4) the prototyping that led up to Erlang.\n\nSlides & full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/bjarne-daecker/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - BJARNE DÄCKER\nMember of the Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering. For five years chairman of the committee for funding Computer Science research. For six years Swedish member of the committee for EU's IT prize. Member of the society of researchers and members of parliament.\n\nBjarne worked for 36 years at Ericsson first as programmer and systems analyst, then involved with programming language design and creation of programming environments. Together with 3 other persons proposed the creation of the Computer Science Lab and its manager for 18 years. The Computer Science Lab pioneered Unix, work stations, graphics, expert systems and other techniques but the main goal was to create a software technology for telecoms programming which lead to the definition of Erlang.\n\nMore on Bjarne Däcker: https://codesync.global/speaker/bjarne-daecker/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE MESH LDN 19\nCode Mesh LDN is powered by Code Sync.
