description: "More Culture, More Engineering, Less Duct-Tape\n\nErica Morrison, Director, Software Development & Operations, CSG International \nScott Prugh, VP Software Development and Operations, CSG International \n\nOver the past four years CSG has undergone a major transformation from traditional siloed orgs across development and operations to true cross functional teams in 2016.\n\nLast year we discussed the structural culmination of this journey with the rollout of DevOps teams that follow the model of “You Build It, You Run It” teams. This places Accountability, Understanding and Engineering of the entire lifecycle of design, development and operations on one team.\n\nThis transition has taught us a lot of how Cultural norms of individuals and teams affect behavior. We have learned a lot about technical debt in legacy technologies and how duct-tape fixes pile on to create difficulties and problems in operations.\nIn this presentation, we will further discuss the techniques we have used to influence behavior, incent learning and knowledge sharing and change the cultural norms of established IT enterprises and practices. We will also reflect on applying modern engineering and architectural principles to established and seemingly intractable technologies often found in the enterprise space.\n\nDOES17 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
