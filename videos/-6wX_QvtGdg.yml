description: "RubyConf 2018 - Code Review, Forwards and Back by Sumana Harihareswara & Jason Owen\n\nYour team’s code review practices cause ripple effects far into the future. In this play, see several ways a single code review can go, then fast-forward and rewind to see the effects – on codebase and culture – of different code review approaches.\n\nThe setting: an office conference room. The characters: a developer, who’s written a chunk of new Ruby code, and a team lead, who’s about to review it. The code is not great.\n\nSee a fast-paced montage of ways things can go. Recognize patterns from your past and present. Learn scripts for phrasing criticism constructively. And laugh."
