recordingDate: 1383937174
description: 'Building great HTML5 games starts with picking the correct tech to build on. WebGl, Canvas, and NaCl will be covered. Games often push the browser to the limit, so you must become familiar with builtin performance analysis tools and best practices for keeping the GC under control. Finally, Polymer can allow your game to be built with custom elements, a demo of a 3D graphics engine built on top of Polymer will be shown.'
