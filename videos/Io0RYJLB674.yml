description: "Curious about EcmaScript 6 / 2015? Want to use it today? JavaScript has come of age, and this latest version adds lots of syntactical sugar to make our code clearer.\nYou can use these tools in ES5 browsers today by leveraging a code bundler and transpiler. We'll look at the new syntax such as , code et, code import, and code class, transpilers like Babel, and Code Bundlers like Webpack. You can use these open-source technologies in production today to quickly build very powerful web apps."
