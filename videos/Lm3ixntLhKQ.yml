description: "Going from imperative code to a reactive programming model enables us to scale our apps in ways that aren't possible with a scale-out approach. In this session, the presenter discusses & demonstrates: * How Project Reactor builds on reactive streams to help you create performant & scalable reactive microservices * Message brokers & streaming platforms like RabbitMQ & Apache Kafka * How Spring Cloud Stream leverages Reactor to provide fully reactive pipelines for system-wide (ridiculous!) scalability The presenter will code all examples using 100% open source software live and in real time.\n\nSpeaker: Mark Heckler, Developer Advocate, Pivotal Software, Inc.\n\nMark Heckler is a Java Champion, published author, conference speaker, and Spring Developer & Advocate for Pivotal developing innovative production-ready software at velocity for the Cloud and IoT applications.
