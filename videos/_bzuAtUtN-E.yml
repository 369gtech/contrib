title: 'Faster Object Arrays'

description: "Java is fast. Really fast. But the memory layout of object arrays is an area where Java still inherently lags (in speed) behind the C family of languages. This session introduces StructuredArray, a new Java collection class designed specifically to enable JVMs to optimize memory layout for arrays of objects in a way that closely matches the performance behaviors of arrays of structs in C. StructuredArray works on any JDK (version 5.0 and above), but when  intrinsified  in newer JDKs, it brings dead-reckoning and streaming speed to what is in essence an array of Java objects. The presentation covers the APIs and design considerations behind them and demonstrates the performance benefits of intrinsic implementations.\n\n\nAuthors:\nGil Tene\nGil Tene is CTO and co-founder of Azul Systems. He has been involved with virtual machine technologies for the past 20 years. Gil pioneered Azul's Continuously Concurrent Compacting Collector (C4), and various managed runtime and systems stack technologies that combine to deliver the industry's most scalable and robust Java platforms.\n\nGil is a frequent speaker at technology conferences worldwide, and an official JavaOne Rock Star. In 2006 he was named one of the Top 50 Agenda Setters in the technology industry by Silicon.com. Prior to co-founding Azul, Gil held key technology positions at Nortel Networks, Shasta Networks and at Check Point Software Technologies, where he designed ground breaking traffic management solutions. He architected OSs at Stratus Computer, HA solutions at Qualix/Legato, and served as an officer in the Israeli Navy Computer R&D unit.\n\nGil holds a BSEE from The Technion Israel Institute of Technology, and has been awarded 31 patents in computer-related technologies.\nView more trainings by Gil Tene at https://www.parleys.com/author/gil-tene\n\n John Cuthbertson\nJohn Cuthbertson has been a Hotspot JVM developer for almost 12 years for HP, Intel, Sun/Oracle, and Azul.
