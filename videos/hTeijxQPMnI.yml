title: 'DrupalCon Baltimore 2017: Migrate all the things!'
recordingDate: 1493232607
description: "The new Migrate module in core is great for upgrading sites from Drupal 6 to Drupal 8. But it's useful for a lot more than just that! Migrate\_adds the power of any\_external tool\_to your content workflow.\n\nNot every client is accustomed to using Drupal. Some clients might like Google Spreadsheets; others prefer\_Markdown files in version control. Using Migrate,\_you can let your clients use\_their preferred content building tools—even before you have a Drupal site ready for them! I'll talk about my experiences with several different Migrate-based workflows that we've used at Evolving Web.\n\nThere's already\_information out there about building\_migrations, but most of it focuses on very limited use cases: direct upgrades, or\_simple nodes. I'll cover many other bits and pieces\_you\_need for real-life migration projects, including:\n\nHierarchical menus\nPaths and redirects\nMultilingual data\nFiles and images\nMerging multiple migrations\nWriting custom migration sources and transformations\nFiguring out why your migration isn't working\n\n\nAttendees with some PHP experience will get the most out of this talk—but many parts will be interesting to site builders and project managers as well."
