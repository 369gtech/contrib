title: 'DrupalCon Vienna 2017: Core Accessibility: How are we doing, and what can we do better?'
recordingDate: 1506507120
description: "We often hear \"I don't know what accessibility means\" or \"accessibility is hard\" or \"we don't have budget to deal with accessibility\". We sometimes hear \"the site must be 508 compliant\" or the vague \"the site must be accessible\".\n\nAs we build Drupal websites, our exposure to the world of accessibility is often driven by the client or website owner. If they have accessibility requirements, we learn about these and try to met their needs. Sometimes, it's driven by our own desire or need to make our websites consumable for more people.\n\nIn Drupal core, we've been making good strides incorporating accessibility best practices into the UX and markup. Itâ€™s not only important to help increase Drupal product adoption in\_some markets (e.g. the public sector) that have strict requirements, but accessibility is important to make Drupal sites reach the most people with varying backgrounds and abilities. This can be good for business. It is certainly good for our humanity.\n\nLet's discuss:\n\nBriefly, what are some components of accessibility\nWhat are some recent core accessibility improvements?\nHow do we think we are doing overall in core?\nWhat are we working on now?\nWhat are some of the challenges we face?\nHow can the community help?\nThis is a core conversation, so bring your concerns, opinions, and suggestions, and be ready to chime in!\n\nIntended Audience:\n\nAnyone interested in how we are doing on accessibility in core and with ideas of how we might improve.\n\nSkill Levels:\n\nThis session is suitable for all levels."
