description: "Grab your ticket for QCon Plus November 1-12, 2021: https://bit.ly/3dJxdwm\n\nThis November 2021, Glenn Engstrand, Software Architect at Rally Health will be giving a talk on Managing Tech Debt in a Microservice Architecture. In a recent interview with Dio Synodinos, he covers the motivation for the talk, the target audience, main takeaways, and software trends you should look out for.\n\n“Engineers want to be productive; they want to be able to implement things, cool features they're excited about. When tech debt piles up and starts to get in the way and obstructs them from that, they get frustrated and don't feel good about themselves. I think it's a serious problem that plagues our industry.” - Glenn Engstrand, Software Architect at Rally Health\n\n#QConPlus #SoftwareConference #Software"
