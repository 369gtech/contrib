description: "Spring I/O 2017 - 18 -19 May, Barcelona\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/fbenz/introducing-spring-auto-rest-docs\n\nThis talk introduces Spring Auto REST Docs, an extension to Spring REST Docs that helps you write less and get more. We have been using and evolving our Spring REST Docs extension for over 1.5 years and recently open sourced it: https://github.com/ScaCap/spring-auto-restdocs Spring Auto REST Docs uses tests, introspection and Javadoc to automatically document request and response parameters. We will look at how much work this saved and how it increased the quality of our documentation. Sprint Auto REST Docs proposes a tight coupling of code and documentation. This way we make it easy to add documentation in the first place, and to keep it up to date as your platform evolves. During the presentation, we give instructions on how to use the extension and discuss pros and cons of the proposed approach. We will present our own system as a real-life implementation and highlight the benefits of reusing tests, bean validation and Javadoc together with the freedom of AsciiDoc to generate documentation.\n\nFor further reading: https://dzone.com/articles/introducing-spring-auto-rest-docs"
