description: "\"Event-driven architectures are helping developers convert new product ideas into application quickly, and companies of all sizes love the productivity and velocity of this approach. Using Azure Functions and event-driven patterns, you can now build in days what usually used to take weeks in the on-premises world. \nJoin us to learn how you could benefit from event-driven design patterns in  your applications. We will share learnings gathered from customers running event-driven apps at scale, and discuss best practices and common pitfalls to avoid.\"\n\nMicrosoft Learn -- https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/?WT.mc_id=Build2020_presentation_additionalresources\nMicrosoft Docs -- https://docs.microsoft.com/?WT.mc_id=Build2020_presentation_additionalresources\nChannel 9 -- https://channel9.msdn.com/?WT.mc_id=Build2020_presentation_additionalresources\n\n\nRelated Sessions\nINT161A -- https://mybuild.microsoft.com/sessions/INT161A?wt.mc_id=yt_PLlrxD0HtieHhlbuh4wiUVHGeVw8vY4Rco\nINT161B -- https://mybuild.microsoft.com/sessions/INT161B?wt.mc_id=yt_PLlrxD0HtieHhlbuh4wiUVHGeVw8vY4Rco\nINT161C -- https://mybuild.microsoft.com/sessions/INT161C?wt.mc_id=yt_PLlrxD0HtieHhlbuh4wiUVHGeVw8vY4Rco"
