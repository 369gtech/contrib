description: "The dreaded moment: you feel stagnant, creatively uninspired, maybe even, dare I say it… burnt out? Whether it’s a result of long hours or boredom through familiarity, being blocked can be disheartening —something we all experience in varying degrees. How can you bounce back from a creative block as a developer? How can you re-discover your own motivation and desire to make work that interests you?\n\nThis session will propose ideas and strategies to ban your inner critic and to embrace your inner 5 year old to stomp through creative blocks. We will look at the output of some of these ideas a from slightly burnt out developer – from programming experiments to mentoring initiatives.\n\nStacey Mulcahy\nTechnical Evangelist, Microsoft\nhttps://twitter.com/bitchwhocodes\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
