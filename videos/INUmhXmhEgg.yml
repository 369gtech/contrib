description: "Further information: https://foss-backstage.de/session/labyrinth-400-contributions-game-students-one-month\n\nThe FOSSASIA labyrinth is a game for kids to change to their liking: new rooms, music, features. The architecture and process allow steady contribution to the game with gradually increasing difficulty.\n\nHow can we make open-source projects a place for learning and continuous growth? How can we bring young people into open-source? These are questions I would like to answer. Over the past three years of Google Code-In, I maintained two games with increasing contributions by students. I would like to share the experience I have gained and end with a discussion about how to open up the contributing process for younger people and newcomers and how to keep them engaged.\n\nLabyrinth: https://github.com/fossasia/labyrinth\n\nGoogle Code-In with FOSSASIA: https://gci17.fossasia.org/\n\nLearnings: http://niccokunzmann.github.io/blog/2018-01-18/designing-living-architectures"
