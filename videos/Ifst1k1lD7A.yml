title: 'Using CI/CD to Deploy IoT Edge Modules with Confidence'
language: English
recordingDate: 1571854085
description: "Deep Dives are interactive live events where we do technical deep dives into a new topic to help developers, architects, or anyone building an IoT solution be able to learn and ask questions live with our engineers from Microsoft! \n\nAzure IoT Edge scales out your IoT solution by packaging your business logic into standard containers, then you can deploy those containers to any of your devices and monitor it all from the cloud. However, integrating containers into a continuous delivery pipeline is far from easy. Along with the benefits Azure IoT Edge brings, there are challenges both tech and process related.\n\nThis Deep Dive outlines the steps you need to take for a fully automated CI/CD pipeline that builds IoT Edge modules deployed into Azure IoT Edge devices at scale with confidence. We will show how solution developers and operators can setup the pipelines with their preferred CI/CD tools like Azure Pipelines, Jenkins, etc.\n\nSpeakers:\nDeep Dives are hosted by Pamela Cortez from the Azure IoT Team.\n\nSpecial guests:\nXin Shi - PM\nKat Ngov - Software Engineer\nHadwa Abdelhalem - Software Engineer\n\nResources:\nWatch 'IoT Edge + DevOps':\nhttps://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Internet-of-Things-Show/Azure-IoT-Edge-development-with-Azure-DevOps\n\nRead 'Continuous integration and continuous deployment to Azure IoT Edge':\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/how-to-ci-cd"
