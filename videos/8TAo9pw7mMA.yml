title: 'Rafael Benevides - How not suck at Microservices'
language: English
recordingDate: 1555263232
description: "With people trying MSA architectures, some failed, some succeeded. This talk will show what they need to not fail with MSA architecture.\nYou’ve been hearing about Microservices for months, and probably have taken a look about 12-factor and cloud-native apps too.\nBut there’s a myriad of different Java frameworks and tools that you can use to craft your software and join the pieces together into a Microservices Architecture. You want to use the best platform to deploy all of them.\nJoin this session to see how you can combine a lot of different technologies and tools in a live demo that will open your eyes for the huge possibilities that Microservices can enable you to achieve.\nWe’ll have it all: containers, Docker, Java EE, Vert.x, Wildfly Swarm, Spring Boot, OpenShift, Jenkins, Kubernetes and perhaps much more."
