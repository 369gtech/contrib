description: "Serverless Functions are hot and developer and corporate interest is exploding!

We’ll also dig into the open source Fn Project’s unparalleled Java support which makes it possible to build, test, and scale out Java-based functions applications.\n\nhttps://developer.oracle.com/\nhttps://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/tryit"
