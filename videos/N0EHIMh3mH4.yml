description: "Many have said that Java has no future. But it is now 2015, the new APIs and trendy lambda dances in Java 8. And a crowd of advanced neighbors?? that have their own means of asynchronous processing for ‘going to production quickly.”\n\nLet’s talk about other languages ??and libraries a bit. For a long time we already have Future and ExecutorService for asynchronous execution.
