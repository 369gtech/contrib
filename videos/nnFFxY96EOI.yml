description: "In this session, the developers of the CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java present a selection of real exploits that have compromised Java programs in the field. For each, they describe the core vulnerability exploited, present techniques for avoiding or repairing the vulnerability (including code examples), and discuss existing (or possible near-future) static analyses that can diagnose similar problems.\n\n\nAuthors:\nDean Sutherland\nDean F. Sutherland is a senior software security engineer at CERT. He is a coauthor of The CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java (Addison-Wesley, 2011). Dean received his Ph.D. in software engineering from Carnegie Mellon in 2008. Before his return to academia, he spent 14 years working as a professional software engineer at Tartan, Inc. He spent the last six of those years as a senior member of the technical staff and a technical lead for compiler backend technology. He was the primary active member of the corporate R\nView more trainings by Dean Sutherland at https://www.parleys.com/author/dean-sutherland\n\nRobert Seacord\nRobert C.
