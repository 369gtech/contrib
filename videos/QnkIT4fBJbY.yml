description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2020 by Antoine Danois, Citymapper.\n\nMore info: https://android-makers-2020.firebaseapp.com/schedule/?sessionId=176363\n\nFor a ton of reasons, we want our apps to be lighter. To take less storage space? To be quicker to download?  To get the next billion users? But yes, it takes time to do everything… But... NO. I promise, it can be really easy to lose weight! (At least for your app)\r\n\r\nI want to show you, with only a few hours, your app can be smaller and everybody can do it. WEBP, R8, Lint, so many tools to help us achieve this, I’ll explain everything to you."
