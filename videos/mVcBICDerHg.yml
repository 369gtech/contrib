description: "Resource Oriented Computing and its implementation NetKernel are in danger of becoming a ten-year old overnight sensation. In this webcast Tom Geudens, author of Resource-Oriented Computing with NetKernel, aims to answer the following questions:\n\n    What is it about?\n    What are its origins?\n    What can it do?\n    What are its strengths?\n    What are its weaknesses?\n    Why did I not hear about this before?\n\nAll that will be sprinkled with a liberal dose of examples (the slideshow itself is one of them). And finally I will answer the question ... do I (listener) have to take your (speaker) word for it?\n\nAbout Tom Geudens\n\nAt the age of 15, Tom Geudens' parents gave him a choice. Either become a baker or go into IT. That Christmas Santa brought a MSX homecomputer, the choice was made. At twenty and with a Bachelor in IT under his belt, he joined the IT department of Colruyt, a Belgian retailer specialized in 'Lowest Price' and doing this through automation. Recently he set up his own IT consultancy company, Elephant Bird Consulting. He has worked with technologies from PL/1 through HPUX and Linux, and battled distributed applications development and configuration management issues."
