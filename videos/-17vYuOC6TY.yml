This talk will look at “free range” farming principles and how they might apply to best practices for getting the most out of Kubernetes at scale - across the data centre, the cloud and the edge. What principles could we adapt & apply, and what would the outcomes look like. E.g. alignment to upstream, open standards, CNCF, multi-cluster, multi-cloud."
