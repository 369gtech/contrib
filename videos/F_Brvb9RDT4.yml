description: "(Tom Kunc) This talk is a crash course in teaching and communicating technical topics better, regardless of your own technical skill. It was originally part of a workshop I delivered for new tutors in my University CS programs, with tips to help students learn programming more effectively both in one-on-one and group environments. It spans topics from psychology, to lesson design and to communication skills, and in the small and the large will help you communicate topics better.\n\nhttps://pretalx.com/pycon-au-2021/talk/87NDMH/\n\npython, pycon, australia, programming, conference, technical, pyconline, developers, panel, sessions, libraries, frameworks, community, sysadmins, students, education, data, science\n\nVideos licensed as CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0\r\n\r\nPyCon AU is the national conference for the Python programming community, bringing together professional, student and enthusiast developers, sysadmins and operations folk, students, educators, scientists, statisticians, and many others besides, all with a love for working with Python.\r\n\r\nPyCon AU informs the countryâ€™s Python developers with presentations, tutorials and panel sessions by experts and core developers of Python, as well as the libraries and frameworks that they rely on.\n\nProduced by Next Day Video Australia: https://nextdayvideo.com.au\n\nFri Sep 10 15:00:00 2021 at Education"
