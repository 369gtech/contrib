description: 'The big data world by definition has enough bigness  in it to appreciate optimized algorithms. During the presentation I will illustrate this point by analyzing a geo-spatial problem from the domain of delivery routing. I will present a practical experiment using the OpenStreetMap road graph data for the Malopolska region in Poland. A few solutions with varying time complexities will show that the bigness of data might sometimes indeed be relative.'
