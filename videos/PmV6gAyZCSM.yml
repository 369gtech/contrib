description: "The speech is in Polish. \n\nWe all want to think about ourselves as conscious marketers, entrepreneurs, and consumers. We use a lot of data to learn everything about our personas. We support the highest technology to build a business run supported by proven methods. But still, over 90 percent of how we build our brands, communication and how we make decisions is directed by our subconscious, which ignores all the latest trends - just as it has been doing for ages. This presentation explains why we so often submit to the subconscious, limit our view, and allow ourselves to be guided by prejudices, simplifications, and stereotypes. I will show how to use the power of our brain to strengthen the brand and its communication. \n\nThe speech took place on 9th May 2019 on Marketing Stage during Infoshare 2019."
