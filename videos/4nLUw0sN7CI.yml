title: 'Anne Cahalan Premise: Promises at Mobile Era 2019'
recordingDate: 1574093771
description: "The promise construct has been around since the late 70‘s, and iOS has had libraries for promises since at least 2015. Still, it seems like Swift has been slower to adopt promises than other languages. Promises can make tangled networking code more readable and can simplify complicated API business. Let’s take a look at how a tangle of calls to separate API’s, some using information dependent on previous calls, can be simplified into a series of promises fulfilled or rejected. We’ll investigate the pros and cons of various promise frameworks for Swift and of the promise pattern itself.\n\nAbout the speaker:\nAnne is an iOS developer at Team Snap, where she is constantly delighted by the niftiness of Swift. Passionate about clean code, craft cocktails, and nice yarn, she dreams of an elegantly-designed app that pairs cocktails with knitting patterns. She is contractually required to mention her three-legged cat, Wobbles.\n\nAbout Mobile Era\nMobile Era is organized by a team of enthusiasts across several technology companies in Oslo. We're passionate about developing mobile apps and want to see a kick-ass event in Oslo for people like ourselves. The organizing committee consists of developers who are also active in organizing open events, conferences and meetups in the Oslo developer community.\n\nOur topics: iOS / Android, Mobile web / PWA, Cross-platform / JS-to-Native, IoT / Hardware, Mobile UX / Accessibility\n\nFollow us on:\n\nWebsite: mobileera.rocks\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/mobileeraconf\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/mobileeraconf/\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/mobileeraconf"
