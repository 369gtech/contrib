description: 'We wouldn''t be where we are at Google without you, the developer community. We are working to support you better by bringing together all developer resources, programs, events, tools, and community into one place, developers.google.com. As part of this project, we''re introducing a new identity, complete with a new look, to unify all of our developer offerings.Our new logo says Google Developers, and that''s intentional: it reflects our focus on you, not just the tools we provide. We hope you like it.'
