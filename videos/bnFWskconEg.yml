title: 'Ron Evans: Cylon.js: The JavaScript Evolution Of Open Source Robotics [JSConf2014]'
recordingDate: 1406557403
description: "The robotics revolution has already begun. You can even buy drones and robotic devices at local retail stores. Unfortunately, it has been too hard to develop code for robots, and nearly impossible to create solutions that integrate multiple different kind of devices. \n\nThat is why we created Cylon.js, a JavaScript framework for open source robotics & the Internet of Things. Cylon.js makes it easy to write apps that communicate with many different kinds of hardware devices all at the same time. The time has come for the next generation of open source robotics, and Cylon.js is ready to help!"
