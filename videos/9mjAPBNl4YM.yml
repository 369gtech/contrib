title: 'Flink Forward 2016: Maxim Fateev - Beyond the Watermark: On-Demand Backfilling in Flink'

description: "http://flink-forward.org/kb_sessions/beyond-the-watermark-on-demand-backfilling-in-flink/\n\nFlink has consistency guarantees and efficient checkpointing model which make it a good fit for Uber’s money-related use cases, such as driver incentives. However, Flink’s time-progress model is built around a single watermark, which is incompatible with Uber’s business need for generating aggregates retroactively. The talk covers our solution for on-demand backfilling. It also outlines other abstractions and features we expect Flink to support as it matures."
