description: 'Catch2 is a popular unit testing framework with a new major release is coming soon. In this talk, we will go over what has changed in Catch2 recently, and what further changes you can expect as a part of the next major (v3) release. First, we will take a look at the runtime and compile-time improvements that the new major version brings. Then we will take a look at other changes, including changing the distribution model to a proper library, and new features, such as support for multiple reporters, improved matcher framework and other miscellaneous changes.'
