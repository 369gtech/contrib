description: "Presented at Code & Supply in Pittsburgh.\n\nDeploying changes to your application can be scary. But with good procedures in place and proper tooling, much of the fear can be taken away. In this talk, Cory Gwin will explore some of the best practices he has seen working with a number of large codebases to release changes including things in place at GitHub. He will explore:\n\n- Automating tasks.\n- Processes for reviewing code.\n- Deploying code incrementally.\n- Team culture.\n- Schema and data change best practices.\n- CI/CD.\n- Monitoring / alerting.\n- and more.\n\nAbout the CMU+C&S Confluence Talk Series:\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nFrom AI-powered computer vision to ultra-massive distributed systems, the interwoven nature of the research/practice dynamic can’t be understated.\n\nConfluence is a talk series that grabs that dynamic by the horns.\n\nJointly produced by Carnegie Mellon University’s Institute for Software Research and Code & Supply, Confluence is a free tech talk series that will bring together Pittsburgh’s most bleeding-edge researchers and influential front-line developers to learn, inform, guide, and inspire one another."
