A GUIDE TO WRITING PROPERTIES OF PURE FUNCTIONS\nby John Hughes\n\nABSTRACT\nProperty-based testing is an appealing approach to testing, but requires developers to identify suitable properties to test--and many find this difficult, and find the simple properties in tutorials difficult to generalize. In this talk, I'll present five different strategies for coming up with properties of pure functions, and I'll compare their effectiveness as tests; I'll also warn of the biggest pitfall to be avoided. You'll leave my talk with new ideas for writing properties of your own functions. I'll be using the Haskell version of QuickCheck for my examples, but the ideas are usable with any property-based testing tool.\n\nSlides & full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/john-hughes/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - JOHN HUGHES\nCo-designer of Haskell and QuickCheck\n\nJohn Hughes has been a functional programming enthusiast for more than thirty years, at the Universities of Oxford, Glasgow, and since 1992 Chalmers University in Gothenburg, Sweden. He served on the Haskell design committee, co-chairing the committee for Haskell 98, and is the author of more than 100 papers, including \"Why Functional Programming Matters\", one of the classics of the area. With Koen Claessen, he created QuickCheck, the most popular testing tool among Haskell programmers, and in 2006 he founded Quviq to commercialise the technology using Erlang. In 2018 he became an ACM Fellow.\n\nMore on John Hughes: https://codesync.global/speaker/john-hughes/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE MESH LDN 19\nCode Mesh LDN is powered by Code Sync.
