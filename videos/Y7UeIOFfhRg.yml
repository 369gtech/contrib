description: "What’s the relationship between features and stories? What is a ‘user’ story anyway? Where do acceptance criteria fit in? These questions (and more) are often answered badly - when they aren't ignored completely.\n\nIn this session Steve will dissect a user story and find that they come in several shapes and sizes (that change throughout the project lifecycle). He will walk through the evolution of a feature file and see why so many of the text-book examples actually encourage bad habits.\n\nBy the end of this session, attendees will walk away being able to describe the multiple uses of user stories as well as understand that misuse is commonplace. They will learn to recognise the value of user stories, appreciate the strengths and weaknesses of typical user story templates, as well as having gained in depth knowledge of the relationship between feature files and user stories. We hope also that attendees will have learnt to identify the shortcomings of typical text-book feature file examples."
