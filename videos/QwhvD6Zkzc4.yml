description: "GPU Machine Learning From Laptop to Cloud - Mark Puddick, Pivotal \n\nIn this session Mark will talk about how to setup and build containers to run GPU accelerated Machine Learning workloads on your laptop and move these easily to cloud. The session will cover setting up a local GPU accelerated environment, which can be great for testing on smaller data, then moving this over to run on larger sets in the cloud. Although the concepts in this session will focus on Python and Kersas workloads this can easily be applied to other machine learning technologies. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPaW"
