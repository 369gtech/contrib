title: 'Keynote | Flink Ahead 2.0: The Sequel - Konstantin Knauf'
recordingDate: 1604057385
description: "In the last few years, SQL has been making a comeback as a way to lower the entry barrier to distributed data processing. The rise of Flink SQL is a manifestation of this process in the realm of stream processing. Flink SQL was originally released in 2016 as a way to make stateful stream processing accessible to a broader audience. Today, the Flink SQL ecosystem accounts for about fifty percent of overall development in the Apache Flink project.\n\nOver the years the community has built a SQL engine that unifies batch and stream processing while simultaneously providing best-of-class capabilities for real-time use cases and materialized view maintenance including streaming joins, pattern matching and out-of-the-box support for change-data-capture formats.\n\nIn recent months the team at Ververica has worked hard on creating an environment that makes Flink SQL shine even brighter. I believe we have managed to make this versatile framework more accessible, its features more visible and its operations more manageable. But judge for yourself as I demonstrate Flink SQL in a diverse set of use cases during this talk."
