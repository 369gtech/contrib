description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nDiscussion & Comments: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2019\n—\nThis Session is the Closing Keynote of the Back to Basics Track.\n\nIt’s been said that a programming language is a tool, and that different tools are designed to be good for different tasks. What is C++ good for? How is it a different sort of tool than other popular languages?\n\nThis talk will go into some depth on the design priorities of C++ (from the perspective of both language and library participants on the committee). We’ll dive into the ways that C++ distinguishes itself from other languages with surprisingly consistent (if unusual) design priorities. We’ll also point out ways that C++ is a wholly different tool than other languages, sometimes resulting in novel gotchas and failure modes.\n\nIf you’ve ever been interested in the raw material for a deep comparison on “Which language is better suited for a task”, this talk should provide a lot of material for understanding what C++ really is.\n— \nChandler Carruth\nGoogle\n\nTitus Winters\nGoogle\nC++ Codebase Cultivator\nNYC\nTitus Winters has spent the past 6 years working on Google's core C++ libraries. He's particularly interested in issues of large scale software engineer and codebase maintenance: how do we keep a codebase of over 100M lines of code consistent and flexible for the next decade? Along the way he has helped Google teams pioneer techniques to perform automated code transformations on a massive scale, and helps maintain the Google C++ Style Guide.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
