title: 'Adapting the Squad Model at IBM: DevOps and the IBM Marketplace'
recordingDate: 1480625794
description: "Adapting the Squad Model at IBM: DevOps and the IBM Marketplace\n\nAnn Marie Fred, Senior Software Engineering Manager, IBM\n\nIBM is a company that loves to re-invent itself, but adopting a new culture within a company as large as IBM is a gradual process. I'll talk about my personal experience with our transformation of the IBM Marketplace, starting in May of 2015. We started with an ugly website running on traditional enterprise web infrastructure, with four-week sprints and a remote operations team. Within about six months we built a far more agile, squad-based organization that uses true continuous delivery. The Bluemix infrastructure that runs the new Marketplace platform is also lightweight and modern, with very high availability, and our developers manage their own infrastructure. Finally, I'll talk briefly about the design evolution of the website, which proceeded in parallel with the organizational and engineering infrastructure changes.\n\nDOES16 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
