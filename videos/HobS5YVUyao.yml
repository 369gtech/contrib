description: "\"My Daddy Killed the Bookstore. And Now He's Killing the Book: Disruption and Responsibility\"\n\nCharles Stack \n\nFounder & CEO, Sideways\n\nCharles Stack is a successful, serial entrepreneur who launched the first online bookstore -- Books.com -- in 1992. Charles pioneered most of the features we now take for granted in today's internet retailers. Books.com offered millions of books, comprehensive searching, collaborative recommendations (patented), shopping carts, price comparisons (patented), real-time credit card processing, affiliate programs, and he introduced many other now standard internet retailing concepts. Books.com was acquired by CUC in early 1996 and subsequently by Barnes & Noble in 1998.\n\nAt CUC Charles designed and launched groundbreaking sites for online music sales, movies, gifts, computer software, and games.\n\nIn 1998, Charles founded Flashline to address the new opportunity in software components and web services. After navigating Flashline through the technology meltdown of 2001-2003, Charles focused the company on the expanding web services management market and created the leading web services repository solution. BEA acquired Flashline in 2006. The Flashline product was the fastest growing piece of BEA's most important product line, Aqualogic, at the time of BEA's acquisition by Oracle in May 2008.\n\nWith Sideways, Charles is on a mission to evolve the publishing industry and take storytelling to the next level."
