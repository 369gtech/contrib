title: 'Jon Crowley: Data vs insights'
recordingDate: 1542033807
description: "When it comes to content, ”data-driven“ has been the watchword for a while now. Site analytics, media metrics, surveys, device behaviours, video views, social sharing, clicks—every one of these metrics is used as proof in our industry. Someone started, not that long ago, calling these data points insights.\n\nXX% increase in visitors who buy, if they saw X piece of content.\n\nPeople in X age group are more likely to read reviews before deciding to purchase.\n\nThe chances of subscription skyrocket after reading X articles.\n\nThese aren't insights. They're data points. And content created against data points is missing an essential piece of the puzzle: the understanding of why people do what they do. Letting data overtake insights has led many of us to confuse the journey we want to take people on (the sales funnel), for the journey that people actually take (the customer journey). It's time to rethink the way we understand and interpret data. - Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/amuse\n\nSave the date!
