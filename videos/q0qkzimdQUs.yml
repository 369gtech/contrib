This will allow customers to leverage the best system for the job, in a world where new systems are constantly appearing. We will be enabling customers to execute functions on OpenWhisk, V8 Isolates, Knative, and other systems through a unified developer experience. This approach allows the development experience to remain consistent, while being able to take advantage of the latest execution approaches."
