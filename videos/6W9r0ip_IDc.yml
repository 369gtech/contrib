title: 'DEF CON Safe Mode Hardware Hacking Village  - Joseph Long - HackerBox 0057 Build'
language: English
recordingDate: 1597706535
description: "Build HackerBox 0057 to explore microcontroller programming, IoT WiFi exploits, Bluetooth control, IR hacks, lockpicking tools, audio/video signaling, and more. HackerBoxes are the monthly subscription box for DIY electronics and computer technology. Each monthly HackerBox is a surprise. But this month the cathode is out of the bag, so to speak. The theme is SAFE MODE.\n\nThere will be an indie badge kit featuring dual core ESP32, IPS full-color 240x135 display, AV out, IR in/out, micro joystick, USB-C interface, battery charger, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and it's Arduino programmable. Of course there will be swag galore. HackerBox 0057 will bring home a \"village\" of IoT, Wireless, Lockpicking, and of course Hardware Hacking that should not disappoint.\n\nMonthly HackerBoxes usually ship around the last day of the month. However, SAFE MODE HackerBox 0057 will ship a few days early (for both existing a new members) and should be received in time for DEF CON 28 SAFE MODE. We recommend ordering by July 22, but earlier is always better in light of recent postal delays."
