description: "droidcon Italy webinar\n7 June 2020\n\nControlling Bluetooth Mesh Networks with Android Applications\n\nBluetooth mesh is a new Bluetooth technology which was released in 2017.  It allows secure networks of tens of thousands of Bluetooth devices to be created and truly smart, self-optimising buildings to be created, with sensors, lights, air-conditioning units and more, all working wirelessly and automatically together.\n\nBluetooth mesh networks and the devices they contain need to be monitored and controlled, sometimes by humans using a GUI application. This session will explain how Android can be developed for this purpose.\n\nhttps://it.droidcon.com/2020/\nhttps://twitter.com/Droidconit\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/showcase/dro...\nhttps://www.instagram.com/droidconit/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/droidconIt"
