language: English
recordingDate: 1632327349
description: "New laptop, new team, new project. How much time does it take you to complete a cycle around your inner loop, much less the outer loop? Are you wasting time installing SDKs, CLIs, IDEs, and peripheral software? Are you working within a locked down corporate environment? No direct public internet access? When was the last time you were able to go from zero to first code deploy in less than 30 mins? We’re going to review some techniques and a super slim toolset that’s meant to work consistently on Mac, Linux, or Windows OS.\n\n Anand Rao, Advisory Platform Architect at VMware\n Chris Phillipson, Manager, Solutions Engineering, MAPBU at VMware\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/making-onboarding-suck-less"
