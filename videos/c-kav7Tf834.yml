description: "Video of Nicholas Zakas from his Fluent Conference 2012 Presentation\n\nMaintainable JavaScript tackles the difficult problem of writing code as part of a large team. When you're writing code that only you will change, there aren't any issues. As soon as you're writing code that someone else is going to also be changing, you need to think harder about the decisions you make. Will another developer be able to understand what you did? Did you organize your code in such a way that it's easy to adapt and extend? Long after you're gone, will others be able to continue using the same code, or will it need to be rewritten because no one understands it? This session shows the best practices used by teams to ensure their JavaScript is as maintainable as possible.\n\nNOTE:  To view an HD version go to: http://youtu.be/nZihjH6_Qns\n\nAbout Nicholas Zakas\n\nNicholas C.
