description: "20 years of web cryptography, and its amazing how frequently its configured sub-optimally. We've had numerous encryption algorithms, digests, protocols come, and should have GONE, but everyone has just left them on. Its time to shut out the legacy browser. The vast majority of the worlds browser install base now auto-updates, and with strict (and prescriptive) compliance in force, we get to drop the bloat form the past. In this talk we'll cover the current TRANSITIONS we're going through from a web admins perspective: TLS, Cipher Suites, HTTP Security Headers, CAs, the move to an encrypted-by-default web, and more.\n\nEVENT:\n\nlinux.conf.au 2019 â€” Christchurch, New Zealand\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nJames Bromberger\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nATTRIBUTION CREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99Nj-_oaQc"
