recordingDate: 1558618376
description: "Welcome at this conference! We are here today to enjoy all the goodness of this conference. Some people are coming for the talks, some people are coming to network, and some of them are coming for both. Networking at conferences is for some people really difficult. People who are introvert, and for (some) people with autism sometimes find it difficult to network.\n\nIf you network at this conference you make contacts you need for your future development. Some people want to network with speakers, some want to network with other attendees. Networking is great! I give you a plan, tips and tricks to network especially if you have autism or introvert. Enjoy this talk and the rest of the conference!\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndcminnesota.com/"
