description: "So Long and Thanks for All the Tests \nby Seb Rose\n(@sebrose)\n\nDo unit tests make life better? Should we develop using test driven development (TDD)? What exactly are our customers paying for?\n\nThese questions, and others, will be answered definitively in this session.\n\nSoftware development is hard. Unit testing and Test Driven Development (TDD) can make it easier, but only if done well – and that takes time. In this session we will cover:\n\n– HOW these practices can help your project,\n\n– WHAT you can do to get better at them, and\n\n– WHY your boss should care.\n\nYou’ll learn about project risk and how developer testing can improve the chances of a successful delivery. You’ll see how developer tests don’t just protect against regression, but also act as a primary source of documentation. And we’ll take a few hints from the ancient Egyptians!\n\nYou might have heard people say:\n\n– “Tests make it hard to refactor.”\n\n– “The customer doesn't care how many tests there are.”\n\n– “If we had to work the way the agile gurus tell us, nothing would ever get done.”\n\nIf you've ever struggled to respond to these challenges, then this session is for you.\n\nA note about the title: In Douglas Adams’ Hitchhiker’s Guide To The Galaxy the dolphins leave planet earth before it gets destroyed, with their last enigmatic message “So long, and thanks for all the fish” being misinterpreted. Is our software giving us the same message? After all, the software would still perform the same function without the tests, wouldn’t it?\n\nAccess The Slides : http://www.nordevcon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/SebRose-SoLong.pdf\n\nCheck out Nor(DEV):con's website : http://www.nordevcon.com/nordevcon2015/\n\nSeb Rose's Website : http://claysnow.co.uk/"
