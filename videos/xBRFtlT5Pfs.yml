description: "I missed the simplicity of of computers like the C64 and the Apple II and I wondered if I could recreate something like that, but using the Cortex M4 devboard on my desk and a handful of resistors. Can you generate VGA without a video chip? Can you render text without enough RAM for a framebuffer? Can you read from a PS/2 keyboard? Can you get any audio out of it, while doing video at the same time? Can you do it all in Rust, and run tests on an actual PC? Will it run fast enough to be useful?\n\n---\n\nSenior Embedded Systems Consultant at Cambridge Consultants, specialising in wireless communications systems.
