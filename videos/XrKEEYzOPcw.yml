title: 'No Nonsense UI Design - Erik Engheim'
recordingDate: 1569575860
description: "UI design today is often following the latest fad or trend. To a novice it may seem hard to determine what is just about making something cool and trendy vs actually making your application easier to use.\n\nThis talk is intended for developers making applications with complex interfaces, and who struggle with concrete choices: what GUI component is best used in a given circumstance? How should the UI components be laid out? How do I make the user understand which parts are related? How do you pick or design an appropriate icon for a given situation?\n\nWe will look at concrete examples of bad design and how the design can be improved upon.\n\nSave the date for NDC TechTown 2020  (31st of August - 3rd of September)\n\nCheck out more of our talks at: \nhttps://ndctechtown.com/\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/"
