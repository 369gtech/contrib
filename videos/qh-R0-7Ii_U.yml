description: 'In this webcast, Matthew McCullough and Tim Berglund, authors of the O''Reilly Git Master Class videos, introduce you to the very edges of Git''s capabilities. There are plenty of "Getting Started with Git" sessions on the web, but we''d like to take 40 minutes of your time in an entirely different direction. These 40 minutes (followed by Q&A) are primarily live coding with a few diagrams for reference. We show you how Git reaches further than any other version control system to provide capabilities for both the novice and the master craftsperson.'
