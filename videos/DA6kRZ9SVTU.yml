description: "How are you testing with your database?\n\n* Mocking is not an option since you want to test the actual system.\n* In-memory databases, like H2 or HSQLDB, have subtle differences and not all datastores have in-memory cousins.\n* Managing and running tests in parallel against the actual datastore is a pain.\nSo what is the solution? There are some very neat solutions based on containers, namely the Docker-Maven-Plugin and Testcontainers. From your tests you can start a lightweight, throwaway instance of your datastore and this talk will walk you through how to do that.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com\nhttps://ndcporto.com"
