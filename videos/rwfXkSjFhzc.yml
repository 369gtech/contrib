description: "Video sponsor: United States Digital Service (https://usds.gov)\n\nAs technologists and technology leaders, we live in an interesting and chaotic time. The days of ivory-tower enterprise architects doling out treatises on approved technologies are over, instead, we have agile, two-pizza teams building using emerging architecture techniques and the latest languages. How do we get a handle on this environment and make sure what's being done is documented and communicated out to the larger organization?\n\nIn this talk, I'll discuss three techniques that can be used to help:\n\nLightweight Architectural Decision Records\nTechnical Architecture Guilds\nBuilding Reference Implementations\nAll of these may not be right for everyone, but taken together, they can be a powerful force to help document and communicate the decisions that your teams are already making every day.\n\nAbout David Ayers\nDavid Ayers is a Group Vice President of Technology with Leslie's Poolmart.
