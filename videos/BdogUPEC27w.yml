description: "Video from Devoxx Poland 2019.\n\nMicroservices brought you significant benefits, which allow you to structure teams based on business capabilities, improve scalability and enable the flexibility of being polyglot. Unfortunately, these powerful architectures are often complemented by a feature-rich browser application which ends up way too often in the creation of as a single, big and sprawling frontend-monolith.\n\nThe approach of micro frontends is an effective strategy to tackle this problem and first appeared at the end of 2016 on the ThoughtWorks Technology Radar. By going into detail about the idea of extending the concepts of microservices to the frontend world, the importance of end-to-end verticals, the difference of an orchestration- or choreography-based implementation, and the trade-offs in reusability become reasonable.\n\nUpon a closer look at the advantages and challenges you’ve experienced in customer projects, it turns out that micro frontends are not a silver bullet either. Rather, they are suited for a specific set of problems. In a nutshell, micro frontends can be a powerful tool to avoid frontend monoliths and this talk will give you the needed knowledge to decide if it’s the right one for the job."
