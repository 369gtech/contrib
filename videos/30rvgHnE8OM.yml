description: "In this presentation you will learn how to create modular, robust, and durable enterprise Java applications fit for the Cloud Age. Using a modular development approach with Java, OSGi, and a wealth of open source components, you will be shown how to combine these into coherent applications without locking into one of the existing PaaS providers. Finally, we will focus on deployment, introducing Apache ACE, that allows to centrally manage and distribute software components to target systems in the cloud or on premise. And of course there will be lots of live coding!\nLanguage: English\n\nUrl slides: http://www.slideshare.net/Codemotion/building-modular-application-ertman"
