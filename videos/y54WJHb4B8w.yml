description: "Google Tech Talk (more info below)\r\nJuly 7, 2011\r\n\r\nPresented by Robert Nemiroff.\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nThe Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) web site continues to display and annotate many of the best astronomy images of our time. From the Grand Canyon of Mars to distant spiral galaxies sporting powerful explosions, some of the most spectacular images of our universe will be reviewed along with explanations and stories behind them. Started in 1995, APOD has been written and edited by only two people, one of whom will be relating a few of the occasionally humorous happenstances that have occurred while updating daily the same website over a changing web for more than 16 years. \r\n\r\nSpeaker Info:\r\n\r\nRobert Nemiroff has been interested in astronomy since the second grade when he clearly demonstrated an early proficiency by reciting the names of the planets faster than any classmate, including the teacher. Nemiroff received a Ph D. in astronomy and astrophysics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1987. He is now a Professor of physics and astronomy at Michigan Tech, where his current research interests include sky monitoring and cosmology. Since 2006, Nemiroff has frequently tried to teach his classes without a textbook, using only web materials, and placing all of his video lectures freely online. Nemiroff is currently trying to build the world's most useful astronomy portal."
