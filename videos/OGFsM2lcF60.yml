description: "Kind Engineering: How to Engineer Kindness\n\nEvan Smith, Solvemate\n\nSoftware Engineering is an environment that is rife with worrying stereotypes like the \"\"Brilliant Jerk\"\" and the \"\"Peter Principle.\"\" How do you be a kind engineer and encourage kindness in engineering? For the last couple years, Evan has been exploring what it means to be a Kind Engineer through books, media and interviews. It's called different things in different circles but ultimately it leads back to one fact: people who give more unconditionally make themselves happier, their teams happier and their companies happier.\n\nThis talk will cover practical tips for becoming a kinder engineer through the following topics: code reviews, psychological safety, giving/receiving feedback and honesty in the workplace.\n\nView the full LISA21 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa21/program"
