description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nHands-On Stateful Serverless Applications with K8s and Stateful Functions - Seth Wiesman, Ververica \n\nStateful Functions (https://statefun.io/) is a framework that makes it simple to build consistent stateful serverless applications. StateFun is designed to work with popular event-driven FaaS platforms like AWS Lambda, KNative, etc., and provides out-of-the-box consistent state and reliable messaging to FaaS platforms, in a way that preserves the serverless experience and elasticity of these platforms. Stateful Functions is not a library that proxies state access to a database, but an independent event-driven stack replacing the traditional database. The talk will take the audience step-by-step through building and deploying a Stateful Functions application that tracks user events and runs a stateful ML classifier. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ekEk"
