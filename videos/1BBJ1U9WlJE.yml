description: "Google Tech Talk\nMarch 15, 2013\n(more info below)\nPresented by Joseph Kim, President, Genesis International College.\nABSTRACT\n\nJapan has some of the oldest and most respected universities in the world. However, higher education in Japan is only for the privileged and is inaccessible to the majority of high school graduates. Genesis International College of Osaka, Japan (www.genesiscollege.jp) is a non-profit startup English-language college scheduled to launch in 2015 that is aimed at the working class poor of Japan. After giving an overview of Japan's economy and educational system, Joseph Kim will discuss innovation/disruption in higher education and how Genesis College hopes to reach the 15+ million people in the working class poor in Japan through a globalized English-language curriculum. \n\nAbout the Speaker: Joseph Kim is the founding president of Genesis International College. He brings to Genesis College a unique blend of leadership in academics, non-profit organizations, and church ministry. Previously, he was the Executive Vice-President of CBI Japan in Nagoya, Japan. He has taught philosophy and business ethics for Hope International University, Arizona State University, and the University of California, Santa Barbara. He has also taught public speaking and organizational strategy at キリスト聖書神学校 in Nagoya. Although his academic research is primarily in philosophy, the majority of his writing is now focused on leadership, organizational strategy, and effective communication. He is the author of Reformed Epistemology and the Problem of Religious Diversity, a book at the intersection of epistemology and the philosophy of religion. He is currently working on his newest book, Personal Strategy: a Competitive Life, a book which is focused on the personal strategic choices a young person faces when deciding upon their future.\n\nHe has been a keynote speaker or seminar leader, mostly on the topic of leadership, for more than 30 international organizations such as Nagoya University of Foreign Studies (Japan), Handong Global University (South Korea), Torch Trinity Graduate School (South Korea), EMA Nairobi (Kenya), Midwest University, Asia Center (Thailand), Gracepoint Hsinchu (Taiwan), Covenant Seminary (USA), and JAMA Leadership Conferences (USA). He is an alumnus of Harvard Business School (GMP) and Arizona State University where he received his Ph.D. in Philosophy."
