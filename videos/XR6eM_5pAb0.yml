description: 'Last year, myself and a few others started discussing ideas about how we could enhance CSS — ideas about isolation of styling information, reuse of visual traits, and improving developer experience. Some projects had already suggested a solution by converting CSS into JavaScript in some form, but we didn''t want to lose what we loved about CSS. We discovered that by making CSS files local instead of global, a huge class of problems disappeared, and the CSS Modules project was born. But there''s another core problem in CSS — sharing. What''s the best way you could publish a CSS framework like Bootstrap? How could publish a suite of React components with styling that is customisable yet consistent? Where do Web Components fit into the mix? Despite all the progress we and other teams have made, these questions remain unanswered. But there is a change coming. Native CSS Variables are now supported in a majority of browsers and have the power to completely upend the way we write and share CSS. This is a talk about what that might look like.'
