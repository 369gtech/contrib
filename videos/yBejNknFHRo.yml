description: "Speaker: Lynus Hee\n\nWith the increasing popularity and different application of 360 VR, it is important to discuss an import issue that comes naturally with video: Editing. Ever since the first continuity cut was used in 1898 by Rober W. Paul, there has been a development of rules in film montage in which film makers “abide by” such as the 180 degree rule and match action cuts. \n\nSpeaker Lynus Hee has recently been concluded a year-long research into this area of 360 VR video editing and will share his findings. So if you don’t have anyone to celebrate Valentine’s day with, head on down to Toa Payoh Library at 7p.m.\n\nEvent Page: https://www.facebook.com/events/1797368173846126\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/4HYe/"
