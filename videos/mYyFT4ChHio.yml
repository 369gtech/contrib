description: "Deep Dive: Cortex - Tom Wilkie, Grafana Labs & Bryan Boreham, Weaveworks \n\nCortex provides horizontally scalable, highly available, multi-tenant, long term storage for Prometheus metrics, and a horizontally scalable, Prometheus-compatible query API. Cortex allows users to deploy a centralised, globally aggregated view of all their Prometheus instances, storing data indefinitely. In this talk we will discuss the benefits of, and how to deploy, a fully disaggregated, microservice oriented Cortex architecture. We'll also discuss some of the challenges operating Cortex at scale, and what the future holds for Cortex. Cortex is a CNCF sandbox project. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPjK"
