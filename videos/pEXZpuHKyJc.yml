description: "Speaker: Juanito Fatas, Software Engineer, Cookpad\n\nFinally convinced your new client to switch from X to Rails? Did your company acquire a non-rails site? Then you probably need to migrate their data to your existing system. In this talk, I will share some false starts, lessons, tips, optimisations and decisions from a recent data migration I performed. How to migrate large amount of photos and records? What tools will you need and how to test the data migration. What do you need to do before & after the data migration. What I tried and how I migrated large amounts of data while kept the site up and running.\n\nSpeaker's Bio\n\nJuanito is a developer at Cookpad, based in Tokyo, Japan. He spends most of his time programming in Ruby, choosing which emoji to use, and seeking for good ramen.\n\nEvent Page: http://www.reddotrubyconf.com/\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/8HYR/"
