description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nTaking Bare Metal to the Clouds with Tinkerbell - Mark Coleman, Equinix Metal\n\nThe technologies involved in provisioning bare metal machines have remained mostly unchanged since the 1990s. With the recent surge in interest in running cloud native workloads on-prem, this previously underappreciated part of the stack is experiencing a renaissance. Tinkerbell, an open source project for provisioning bare metal using the same API-centric, declarative configuration and automation approach pioneered by the Kubernetes community, helps companies bring cloud native workloads to bare metal. In this talk, Mark Coleman will discuss how the project is built with a focus on openness and transparency, demonstrate how to get from a bunch of servers to a cloud native application, and explain how attendees can get involved with the project."
