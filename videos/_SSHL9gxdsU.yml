description: "Project management in a studio or agency seems to be a black art. Some do it well, others struggle. There are numerous methodologies and frameworks out there to manage your projects well, but what about just managing the entire process, from conception to execution?\n\nThe truth is, we can learn a lot about managing our projects better by looking at how the programming world is evolving. We’ll learn to stay DRY, not become WET and define how each of us can individually lead our teams to better communication and morale.\n\nWe’ll take a look at some of the main ingredients behind a good creative and programming process, how to interact with clients and the team, look at some tools that will help (but not overwhelm us), and establish some really easy techniques that will make the whole thing run much smoother.\n\nDaniel Schutzsmith\nCreative Technology Director, Mark & Phil\nhttp://www.twitter.com/schutzsmith\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/danielschutzsmith\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
