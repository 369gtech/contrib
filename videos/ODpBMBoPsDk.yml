description: "Finding Truth in Legacy Systems\n\nDaniel Cordes, Portware\n\nSystems can go sour even when from day one we try to hew to the best practices of server and configuration management. But it can seem a lost cause to make that effort in inherited legacy environments that no one truly understands.
