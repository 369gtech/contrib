description: "Flutter: The cross platform mobile framework we've all been waiting for?\nTom Alabaster\n\nFlutter is Google's cross-platform framework to join the likes of Microsoft's Xamarin and Facebook's React. Why will Flutter be making waves in the mobile sector? That's what we'll be looking at in this talk.\n\nI'll be talking about why Flutter is different from the rest, giving an example of earthware using it in production, and giving a 10 minute live demo of what can be achieved in a short space of time!\n\nTom Alabaster\n\nTom is a mobile developer at earthware (earthware.co.uk) and has been doing mobile development for more than 4 years. He's used native development tools and various cross-platform technologies in the past but has always been hunting for the \"holy grail\" of mobile app development."
