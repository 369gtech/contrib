description: "Distributed applications are now the norm. Distributed across services, servers, across data centers, and across clouds. On different platforms and by different teams.\n\nHow do we connect all of these? It turns out that events are a good tool for this. Instead of tight coupling directly between your services, opt for a loose and flexible event based architecture.\n\nWe'll look at different types of events and where to use them, and we'll look at some examples on how we've used events in production.\n\nIf you want to rapidly build a robust and scalable event-based backend, this session is for you. Glenn will teach you the concepts you need and show you how to put them into practice."
