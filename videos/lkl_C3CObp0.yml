description: "The full title of the speech is: Micro frontends: extending service-oriented architecture to front-end development\n\nWith the ongoing transformation of StepStone's core application from monolithic to a service-oriented architecture, our frontend developers faced new challenge – how to implement a user interface in this new landscape of distributed systems. We decided to adapt the concept of micro frontends, which is service-oriented approach to frontend development. In this talk, I'll explain our reasoning behind this choice, show how we enhanced our software engineering processes in order to implement micro frontend approach, and share most valuable lessons we've learned during this journey.\n\nThe speech took place on 9th May 2019 on DevTrends Stage during Infoshare 2019."
