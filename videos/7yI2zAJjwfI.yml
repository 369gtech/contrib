description: "Big data is powerful. It helps you make informed decisions about your business, but putting it to use can be time consuming. There's nothing worse than taking the time to build out a dashboard only to realize that it isn't useful.\n\nIn this session Jen Tong, a Developer Advocate on Google Cloud Platform, will show you how cloud computing makes it easier to explore big data. She'll use Google BigQuery to poke around some really big data sets including the GDELT news database, Wikipedia logs, and weather data going back to 1929.\n\nYou'll leave knowing how to use the cloud to effectively explore all that valuable data you've been logging.\n\n# Jen Tong\nJen is a Developer Advocate on Cloud at Google. In this role she helps developers build cool stuff on all sorts of platforms. If she’s away from her laptop, she’s probably skating around a roller derby track, or hanging from aerial silk."
