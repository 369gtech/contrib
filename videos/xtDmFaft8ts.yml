language: English
recordingDate: 1476119557
description: "Apache Geode is a low latency, high concurrency key/value object store. If you are building high-speed, data-intensive applications that need to elastically meet performance requirements at scale, then Geode is the right tool for you. Apache Geode provides database-like consistency, reliable transaction processing and a horizontally scalable shared-nothing architecture to maintain predictable low latency performance with high concurrency processing. Learn about the features of Apache Geode at this session. The Apache Geode project is released under Apache 2 license. The Apache Geode project is the power behind Pivotal's commercial GemFire product.\n\nSpeaker: Mike Stolz, Principal Engineer & Gemfire Product Manager, Pivotal"
