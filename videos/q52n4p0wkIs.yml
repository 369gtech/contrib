description: 'Writing tests is a significant part of the development process, especially in Ruby and Rails community. But usually, we do not care too much about tests'' code organization, optimization, conventions, etc. â€“ all these lovely things we always do with our application code.

I want to share some tips & tricks on how to make your tests run faster, look prettier and be maintainable.'
