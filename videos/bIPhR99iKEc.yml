description: "Killing Our Darlings: How to Deprecate Systems\n\nDaniele Sluijters, Spotify\n\nA lot of the duties of SRE's involve around helping with the creation of new (infrastructure) services and supporting these while they're in use. What we don't talk about very often is how to shut these services down once they've reached EOL. \n\nThis talk focuses on what SREs can do, from the start right to the end, in order to facilitate being able to deprecate and shut down services with minimal impact on the rest of the organisation.\n\nView the full SREcon17 Americas Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon17americas/program"
