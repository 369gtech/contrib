description: "Don't miss the Deno Train\nSpeaker : M4dz\n\nAnnounced when no one expected it, the Deno project appeared to be what we all wanted Node was: a secure, well-designed, TypeScript natively compatible, and modular runtime ready to power high-demanding applications in the modern Web Dev era.\n\nThere it is: Deno is now more and more in mind, and itâ€™s time to jump into the Deno train! This talk is a state-of-the-art tour of the technology: what Deno exactly is? How to use it to power a backend API for PWAs? What to expect in term of front-end revolutions?\n\nA show with Demos, Code, Advanced use-cases, and Jokes: Spared no expense!"
