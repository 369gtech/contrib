description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2013\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nBen Christensen - Software Engineer at Netflix\n\nABSTRACT\nRxjava is a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs using observable sequences for the Java VM that supports Java 6+, Clojure, Scala, Groovy, JRuby and Java 8 lambdas.\n\nLearn how the Netflix API uses RxJava (http://techblog.netflix.com/2013/02/r...) to implement highly concurrent web services against asynchronous data sources without blocking, synchronization or thread-safety concerns by using declarative functional reactive composition.\n\nCome see what functional reactive programming looks like, how it fits into Java, what use cases it addresses and real-world examples of how it can become a tool in your application development. \n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
