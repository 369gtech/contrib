description: "ðŸ”¥Edureka Machine Learning Engineer Masters Program: https://www.edureka.co/masters-program/machine-learning-engineer-training\nThis Edureka video is a part of the Python Tutorial series which will give you a detailed explanation of how neural networks work in Python. Modeled in accordance with the human brain, a Neural Network was built to mimic the functionality of a human brain. The human brain is a neural network made up of multiple neurons, similarly, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is made up of multiple perceptions.\nTopics covered:\n00:00:00 Introduction\n00:00:24 Agenda\n00:03:05 Introduction to Python\n00:04:56 Why Neural Networks?\n00:09:45 Motivation behind Neural Networks\n00:12:50 What are Neural Networks?\n00:14:11 Single Layer Perceptron\n00:14:14 Multi Layer Perceptron\n00:25:17 Application of Neural Network\nPython Tutorial Playlist: https://goo.gl/WsBpKe\nPython Tutorial Blog Series: http://bit.ly/2sqmP4s \n\n#Edureka #PythonEdureka #neuralnetworks #pythonneuralnetworks #pythonprojects #pythonprogramming #pythontutorial #PythonTraining  \n\nðŸ”´Subscribe to our channel to get video updates.
