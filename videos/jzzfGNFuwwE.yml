description: "Panel Discussion: Care and Feeding: Burnout and Self Care in our Community - Aaron Crickenberger, Google; Rithu Leena, Lyft; Ashley McNamara, Microsoft; Stephen Augustus, VMware; and Noah Kantrowitz, Ridecell \n\nBurnout has recently been discussed a lot in both the open source community and broader tech industry, but too often these discussions simply acknowledge that burnout exists. We can do better. The care and feeding of ourselves is a start. How about the care and feeding of our community?  Together we will talk about the symptoms, sources, and (sometimes) solutions that we have used within the Kubernetes community to address burnout  Whether you are personally struggling, know someone that is, or just want to know more about the difficulties our community faces, please join five of our community leaders in a discussion about burnout. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPZt"
