description: 'Do you remember Equifax? How did they manage to steal data from almost 200 million users? They simply fell victim to a vulnerability on a framework, Struts, which older developers like me remember well. But you who now use cooler things like Guava or Jackson, do you feel safe? Unfortunately, you are not. After a clear introduction to the problem, with a couple of other illustrious examples, we will perform a couple of exploits together live and then take a look at possible prevention strategies. This talk will open your eyes to a problem you did not know you had, and that, I am sure, you want to fix.'
