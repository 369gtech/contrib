title: 'Polyglot Enterprise Development on the JVM'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433517041
description: "In the past decade, many promising non-Java languages have targeted the JVM as an ideal runtime. However, from Ruby to Lisp and JavaScript, developers are now finding that they need enterprise capabilities, such as messaging or transactions, that their Java counterparts have taken for granted for more than a decade. In this session, you will see that rather than reinventing the wheel, it is possible for developers using these non-Java languages to utilize many of the capabilities in a Java EE 6 application server and, importantly, do so in a way that makes sense for their community. The fact that Java implementations underlie these approaches can be completely hidden. The session includes a look at some illustrative successful community projects.\n\n\nAuthor:\nMark Little\nDr. Mark Little leads JBoss technical direction, research and development.
