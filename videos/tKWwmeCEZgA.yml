description: "Wix Engineering hosts renowned developers and speakers Dan North & Roy Rapoport (Slack)!\n\nAn evening's conversation with Dan and Roy - The two discuss Process and Procedures versus People and Culture, with the conversation driven by audience participation (via sli.do).\n\nTwo masterminds, unveiling insights from their vast experience over the years.\n\nDan North - Dan has been coaching, coding and consulting for over 25 years, with a focus on applying systems thinking and simple technology to solve complex business problems. He uses techniques from Lean operations, Theory of Constraints and Agile software development to help organisations anticipate and respond to the challenges of changing business needs. Dan is the originator of Behaviour-Driven Development, an agile approach to software development that encourages teams to deliver the software that matters by emphasising the interactions between stakeholders. He also proposed Deliberate Discovery, which challenges assumptions around software planning and estimation. He argues that there are no best practices and that everything we do is subject to opportunity cost.\n\nRoy Rapoport - Roy leads the Data Engineering organization at Slack, where he is tasked with helping scale Slack's data organization to deal with massive data, tractable questions in need of answers, and the fundamental question frustrating data people everywhere: \"What does this even mean?\" (but he's not speaking for Slack). Before this he spent some years at Netflix, both in IT and in Engineering responsible for Netflix's real-time operational insight systems. He has an eclectic[0] background in software engineering, IT, operations, network and systems engineering, and QA, which is probably about as relevant as mentioning that he owns goats."
