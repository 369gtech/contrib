description: "Learning to Map\n\nA narrative and exploration of how one person’s understanding of the application and theory of mapping has changed through usage and experience. This talk will outline some of the key ‘aha!’ moments where shifts in understanding happened, as well as the ways mapping was practically used to help drive digital change in automotive. Looking at Wardley maps, a revised approach to Impact Mapping, Maturity mapping and Cynefin we will look at how they have helped create direction and insights, as well as building a common language with the team and stakeholders."
