Then we'll cover Qt Basics, Dialogs, Widgets, Drag and Drop Interfaces, Creating / Opening / Saving Files, Menus, Toolbars, Icons, Printing, and much more.\n\nQt is an amazing framework for creating cross platform C++ GUI applications.\n\nBrought to you thanks to contributions from my Patreon subscribers such as https://perl6.org/"
