language: English
recordingDate: 1596959881
description: "As the previous DEF CON Voting Villages have proved, our voting equipment and infrastructure are very vulnerable to multiple types of attacks. But now, with everything thatâ€™s going on in the world ,voting by mail is the new vulnerable thing! Instead of focusing on problems and broken things, this talk will focus on simple fixes that vendors and governments can put into action right now. Starting with the registering to vote, then moving through parts of the entire system, BiaSciLab will offer suggestions on how simple practices and changes in thinking can improve the security of the entire system.\n\nLast year, in the Voting Village BiaSciLab did a talk on the election systems problems and howto fix them. This year with voting by mail, new problems are appearing! Like States not allowing people to vote by mail! Breaking down these flaws and offering real solutions for each one, BiaSciLab will bring hope in the face of this daunting and complex security problem in these hard times."
