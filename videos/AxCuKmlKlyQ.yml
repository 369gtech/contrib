title: 'Immutable Infrastructure in the Age of Kubernetes'
language: English
recordingDate: 1584045937
description: 'Immutable infrastructure promises huge benefits to most software application architectures. Stateless containers promise more stable upgrades and rollbacks, resulting in less downtime and more deployment flexibility. As sophisticated container orchestration tools like Kubernetes become more commonplace, the additional layers of abstraction and better tools and platforms have made the golden image dream a reality. But these benefits have primarily been realized at the application level, not at the host operating system level. In this talk, weâ€™ll demonstrate a reference architecture for an immutable, API-driven infrastructure using Kubernetes and Talos, and describe ways that organizations can realize the benefits of immutable infrastructure at the host OS level.'
