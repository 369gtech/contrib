title: 'Betting on evolutionary architecture - James Lewis'
recordingDate: 1539326841
description: "We often think of software architecture as one of those things we just have to do right at the beginning of a project, often using fancy tools.\nIn this talk, James offers an alternative. What decisions would we make differently if we had the ability to rapidly evolve our architecture? The tools and techniques we now have available allow a new type of architectural decision making possible; from Software Defined Networking, IaaS and Continuous Delivery to Real Options and Architecture Decision Records. James will cover pre-requisites that allow us to make small bets on architecture and explore the strange world of evolutionary design that this technique makes possible.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcsydney.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
