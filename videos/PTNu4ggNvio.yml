description: "Aidas Pasilis – database and warehouse development lead at CIG (Callcredit information group - UK based credit referencing agency) with over 10 years of experience in IT industry. As a development lead Aidas is responsible not only for design and development of new and existing solutions, but also working with different departments and people across the whole business to ensure on time delivery of existing products. He has taken on many roles and has worked with different Agile methodologies (Scrum, Kanban, DSDM, XP, etc.), by adapting and shaping team approaches to best fit different project types and delivery goals. He had to take Agile beyond the boundaries of a team and expand Agile best practices to other areas of influence. He’s active member of DevOps movement in CIG and is at the frontier of continuous and effective adaptation of Agile practices.\n\nOh my AGILE!\n\nOver years of work I’ve found that often people know a lot of theory and stick to cliché terms, but don’t necessarily know what it actually means in practice. So in this session I will look at practical side of delivery with a grain of humour - Agile theory versus practice, failure versus success, will talk about different things that make teams tick and some, sometimes even small things, that can change the outcome of the project."
