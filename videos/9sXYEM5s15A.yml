title: 'Sharding in Oracle Database'
language: English
recordingDate: 1530321570
description: "Held in March 2018\n\nOracle Sharding is a scalability and availability feature for custom-designed OLTP applications that enables distribution and replication of data across a pool of Oracle databases that do not share hardware or software. The pool of databases is presented to the application as a single logical database. Applications elastically scale (data, transactions and users) to any level, on any platform, simply by adding additional databases (shards) to the pool. Scaling up to 1000 shards is supported.\n\nAskTOM Office Hours offers free, monthly training and tips on how to make the most of Oracle Database, from Oracle product managers, developers and evangelists.\n\nhttps://asktom.oracle.com/\n\nOracle Developers portal: https://developer.oracle.com/\nSign up for an Oracle Cloud trial: https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/tryit\n\n\nmusic: bensound.com"
