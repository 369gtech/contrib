description: "PyData Berlin 2018\n\nIn the recent times, several meta-algorithms in deep learning have opened up the possibility to use Computer Vision in various applications. Particularly in the field of Object detection, Semantic Segmentation and Instance Segmentation there has been a steady improvement in algorithms like Faster R-CNN, SSD, YOLO, MASK-RCNN. When to apply what and how to leverage those in real-world applications?\n---\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
