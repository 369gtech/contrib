description: "Lets build a simple machine learning API together! I'll use the now classic neural style transfer algorithm to create a simple API that takes in an image and returns a stylized version of it. We'll use the FloydHub cloud service to both train and serve our model in the cloud. We can easily turn a deep neural network into a REST API that anyone can use, i'll detail those steps in this live stream and we'll build it using Tensorflow.\n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/Machine-Learning-API-Tutorial\n\nPlease Subscribe!
