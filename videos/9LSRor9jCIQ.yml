description: "OWASP AppSec EU 2018 DevOps Track - Day 2, talk 2\n\nAre you responsible for more than just AppSec? What do you do when you have more teams to support than security experts? How can you make security champions out of dissenters in the development team?\nThere just aren’t enough security experts to go around. You have to support the multitude of Agile and DevOps teams that are making production software changes anywhere from once a month to several times a day. The lack of resources coupled with the ever increasing responsibilities can make you feel like a rouge warrior in the battle against cybercrime. What’s a security professional to do? Whether you are a team of one or five, there aren’t enough hours in the day and even if there was more budget, good luck finding someone to fill that security role. What if I told you that through careful selection and good training it is possible to build your own army from the very people who own the development process?\nWhat you will learn:\n1. Who to recruit as security champions\n2. How to train these champions in productive application security\n3. How to measure success\n4. How to build a scalable security program\n 5. What to expect from champions (responsibilities)\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
