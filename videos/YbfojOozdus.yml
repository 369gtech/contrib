description: "The Java EE platform aims to increase your productivity. It encompasses a range of specifications such as JPA, EJB, JSF, and JAX-RS. How do these specifications fit together in an application, and how do they relate to each other? And where does HTML5 fit in? In this session, the NetBeans IDE is used to help you understand the Java EE platform in the context of the HTML5 platform, thanks to the many code generators and editor features the IDE provides. By the end of the session, you will have an understanding of the aims and usage of the Java EE platform, be able to leverage it in the context of HTML5, and know how to start developing your own Java EE/HTML5 applications.\n\n\nAuthors:\nGeertjan Wielenga\nGeertjan Wielenga is a NetBeans product manager working at Oracle, focused on Java development and HTML5 development with NetBeans IDE and the NetBeans Platform.
