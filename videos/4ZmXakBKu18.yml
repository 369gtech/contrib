description: "You may have heard the news that functional programming is in and object-oriented programming is out. Well, that's not actually true, but it's safe to say that functional programming is grabbing the attention of more and more software developers. A rapidly growing programming paradigm, functional programming is about tackling software complexity by focusing on loosely coupled functions building up to larger-level programming abstractions. In this webcast talk I'll run through the basic concepts behind functional programming using JavaScript and build up to more complicated topics along the way. \n\nCan data and connectivity improve criminal justice and mitigate conflicts?\nA world of sensors gives us almost complete surveillance. Every mobile device tracks moves, forming a digital alibi or new evidence for the prosecution. And with the right data, predictions look frighteningly like guilt.\n\nHow does a data-driven, connected world deal with crime, conflict, and peacekeeping? Will we be prisoners in a global Panopticon, begrudgingly honest because we might be surveilled? Or will total transparency even the balance between the enforcer and the citizen?\n\nJoin a lineup of thinkers and technologists for this free online event as we look at the ways data is shaping how we police ourselves, from technological innovations to ethical dilemmas.\n\n - Don't miss an upload!
