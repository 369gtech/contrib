description: "Incrementally Building Incremental - Alec Holmes\n\nThis talk walks through the development process of incremental xDS lead by Alec Holmes and Joshua Rutherford inside the open source repository “envoyproxy/go-control-plane” . It touches on differences between SOTW and Incremental xDS, implementation hurdles tackled when building out the new protocol, and design changes in the pre-existing codebase needed to build out Incremental. Alec will lay out the remaining goals, and discuss the next steps for the repository."
