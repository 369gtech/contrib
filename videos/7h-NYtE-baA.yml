title: 'Who Wants to Be a Code Millionaire? ft. Kamil Debowski'
language: English
recordingDate: 1603066431
description: "Competitive Programming is a mind-sport involving solving timed math & programming puzzles. Kamil Debowski is one of the world's top competitive programmers. In this spinoff of \"Who Wants to be a Millionaire\" I invited Kamil to solve 5 programming questions in order to win a million points (not dollars), which can be traded in for a signed copy of my book Decentralized Applications and an unreleased song. The programming questions from CodeChef normally require code input, but i've modified them to be multiple choice by creating several possible code snippets. The math & machine learning questions are my own. Follow along with Kamil and see if you can make it to the end without getting an incorrect answer, enjoy! \n\nPlease Subscribe! It means a lot to me.\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/sirajraval\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/sirajraval\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/sirajology\nLinkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/sirajraval/\nWebsite: www.sirajraval.com\nEmail: hello@sirajraval.com\n\nKamil's Channel:\n@Errichto \n\nLearn Machine Learning in 3 Months:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch/Cr6VqTRO1v0\n\nLearn Data Science in 3 Months:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rDhY1P3YLA\n\nCheck out any of the free playlists on my channels if you want to learn machine learning & other computer science topics in a really easy and fast way."
