description: "Speakers: Josh Long, Adam Koblentz - ZeroTurnaround\nSpeaker: Adam Koblentz, JRebel and Josh Long, Pivotal\nSlides: https://speakerdeck.com/joshlong/bootiful-jrebel\nSpring Boot, the new convention-over-configuration centric framework from the Spring team at Pivotal, marries Spring's flexibility with conventional, common sense defaults to make application development not just fly, but pleasant! Spring Boot gives you a huge leg up over normal starter projects, now let's give you another boost by adding JRebel. With JRebel, the average Java developer saves over 1 work-month per year by using JRebel to skip rebuild, restart, and redeploys of their application. JRebel 6 launches on November 4, 2014 and includes complete Spring Boot integration. Join Spring's Josh Long and ZeroTurnaround's Adam Koblentz and learn how to combine Boot with JRebel and get more done, in less time with less configuration."
