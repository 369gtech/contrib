description: "ABOUT POLYMER\nWeb Components are a new set of emerging standards that allow developers to extend the web platform by creating their own HTML elements. Imagine if the web had its own mobile SDK, and building a web application meant wiring together well encapsulated components with scoped CSS. That’s the future Web Components will bring about. And using a library like Polymer, we can actually start building projects that leverage these future technologies, today!\n\nPolymer does two things:\n– It polyfills Web Components in modern browsers that lack support (IE 10+, Safari 6+, Mobile Safari), this means you can create projects that use Web Components and actually run them cross browser.\n– It adds features to the browser which are not part of the Web Components standards, but make working with Web Components easier. These features include data-binding, gesture support, property observation, and a clean, declarative syntax for creating new components.\n\n\nABOUT POLYTECHNIC\nPolymer Polytechnic is an event series of in-person, community-run events to help developers learn Polymer. These events are run by local Google Developer Groups or other developer meetups all over the world. Each event is a little different, but generally, Polymer Polytechnic can include a tech talk, series of code labs, and time for personal hacking.\n\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry in the Malmö/Lund region. Foo Café is aimed at those interested in sharing, learning and creating. \nJoin the fun at foocafe.org"
