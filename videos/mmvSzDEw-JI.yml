description: "Kanary - Automated and Integrated Canary Testing Using CRD and an Operator - David Benque, Amadeus & Cédric Lamorinière, Datadog \n\nThe Kubernetes ecosystem provides primitives to easily deploy applications. Now, how might we simplify validation of a new application version before triggering its complete rollout? Canary testing is a popular answer. There are solutions to pilot canary testing from outside Kubernetes. How about driving it from inside Kubernetes instead? Kanary is a new Operator proposing an easy, automated and integrated way to orchestrate the canary testing phase, while controlling the traffic, the validation, and the rollout of a new version. After a quick recap of challenges in managing canary deployments within Kubernetes, this talk will present how Kanary offers a fully integrated and automated canary solution by assembling several cloud-native solutions: Prometheus, Istio, K8s resources and CRD. The talk will end with a demo! \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPaB"
