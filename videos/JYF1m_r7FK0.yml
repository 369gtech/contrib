description: "by Bernard Tyers and Amit Nambiar\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/H.2213/pitch_your_project.webm\n\nIf you contribute to a free / open source project in need of design contributions, come and pitch it to the designers in the room.\nIn this session, FOSS projects as given time to present and ask for contributions to the designers in the room. Each project is given 3 minutes to present. In those 3 minutes, they should briefly introduce the project, explain what design help they need, and provide contact details so designers can reach them after FOSDEM.\n\n\nThe Open Source Design collective will use the information to submit a \"job\" for each project to the Open Source Design \"jobs board\" (https://opensourcedesign.net/jobs/), so that the request for design help reaches not just the designers in the room, but also the wider design community.\n\nRoom: H.2213\nScheduled start: 2020-02-02 15:30:00"
