description: "Talk recording from AmsterdamJS December 2018 Meetup https://www.meetup.com/AmsterdamJS/events/255511327/\n\nRefactoring on a massive scale is a different beast. What to do when \"find and replace\" simply isn't enough? We faced this challenge when we needed to unify the way an initial state of a React component was set across the codebase consisting of thousands of files. This is a story about how we created a faultless commit that touched around 100,000 lines of code. Our solution was to write a program that did the required modifications for us. These kind of programs are often called codemods. Languages and concepts are like tools in a toolbox. Codemods are a new tool to your toolbox.\n\nAbout Tijn\n\nTijn is a software engineer at Reaktor. He mainly writes Node.js/React applications, is interested in anything functional or reactive, and is rarely seen without a cup of coffee. After office hours he likes to play around with esoteric compilers."
