Linda Rising will share one small but important bit of advice that she has uncovered--the power of movement. Some of what she will say will be surprising, even counterintuitive. Linda will report on the research and provide some tips for better thinking, problem-solving, and decision-making.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
