language: English
recordingDate: 1531817091
description: "This talk presents multiple centralized logging approaches and patterns with their advantages and disadvantages, so you can pick the one that fits your organization best:\n\nParse: Take the log files of your applications and extract the relevant pieces of information.\nSend directly: Add a log appender to send out your events directly without persisting them to a log file.\nStructured file: Write your events in a structured file, which you can then centralize.\nFrom a container: Keep track of short lived containers and configure their logging correctly.\nIn Kubernetes: Stay on top of your logs even when services are short lived and dynamically allocated.\nEach pattern has its own demo, so you can easily try out the different approaches in your environment."
