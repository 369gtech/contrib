title: 'Travis Vachon - cljs All The Things: Full Stack Apps with ClojureScript'
recordingDate: 1395788930
description: "JavaScript has a ubiquitous presence in the modern web, not only in the browser but as the substrate for platforms on which developers build web and mobile applications. Thanks in part to Clojure's attitude toward its host platforms, using ClojureScript on these platforms is easy, fun and extremely productive.\n\nIn this talk, we'll discuss 8 months of developing mobile and web applications using ClojureScript for both client and server development. We'll discuss the joys of a single-language stack, the pitfalls of riding the bleeding edge, and Clojure's influence on the design and layout of projects at Utah Street Labs. We'll also introduce parseapp-cljs and its accompanying Leiningen template, two tools we built to enable ClojureScript development on parse.com's Cloud Code platform."
