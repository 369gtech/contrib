description: "Surviving the Grand National\n\nKevin Bowman, Head of Operations, Sky Betting & Gaming\n\nAs one of the UK's largest online betting websites, the Grand National always breaks records by every metric. We have a complex technical platform, involving in-house and 3rd-party provided software, serving a highly dynamic website on the busiest day of the sports betting year.\n\nI'll tell the story \"from the trenches\" of how we planned for and ran the day, and what lessons we learned to make next year's even better. Including technical details (keeping our website running whilst normal customer traffic looks to most companies like a DDoS) and how we organised our responsibilities on the day itself, I'll go through the various challenges we faced and how we overcame them to have our most successful Grand National yet.\n\nDOES16 London\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/eur/"
