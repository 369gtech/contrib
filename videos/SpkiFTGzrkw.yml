description: "So your team is part of a highly innovative, totally disruptive company/organisation/team/university department/cult and you're going to conquer the world? Wonderful. I'm happy for you.\n\nI'm the security person that unicorns call when they need to survive the dark and nasty side effects of becoming \"the next big thing\".\n\nWith lessons learned from helping disruptive and fast paced (often low resourced) teams in 7 countries, let me share with you the reality of security when you are living on the bleeding edge of business and technology.\n\nThis is more than just software security, this is survival."
