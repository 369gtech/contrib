description: "Domain-Driven Design Europe 2020\nhttp://dddeurope.com - https://twitter.com/ddd_eu\n\nIf all models are wrong, but some are useful, what makes for a good model?\n\nWe will look at modelling from a Systems Thinking perspective, with a particular focus on the art of simplification.\n\nEinstein said “Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler.” In modelling terms, we are looking for techniques to help tame complexity.\n\nSometimes, to find the nub of the issue, other times to find new ways of looking at your system.\n\nThis is an interactive session, with brain teasers and puzzles used to challenge people's thinking.\n\nDriven to find better ways of producing code, and then teaching the next generation of developers all our hard-won lessons!"
