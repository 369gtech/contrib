title: 'Open Source Tools for Publishing and Processing Earth Observation Imagery'
recordingDate: 1548395118
description: "Paul Haesler\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/152/\n\nThere are now several earth observation satellites in orbit around our fair planet, beaming down huge volumes of gorgeous imagery every day. Digital Earth Australia (DEA) is a platform managed by Geoscience Australia (GA) to make this imagery of Australia available to government, industry and researchers for easy use. At the heart of DEA is the Open Data Cube, an open source Python platform for working with Earth Observation data. Data 61 has been working with GA to develop open source web services and clients to make this rich source of data accessible to both expert users and non-technical people who just like to look at cool satellite images in the comfort of their own home.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/\n\n#linux.conf.au #linux #foss #opensource"
