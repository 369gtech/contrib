Bruno will also address some strength and weaknesses relating to Node's single threaded architecture, demo TCP-based architectures and how to work with basic socket communications. Finally he'll demo a  chat server written in Node and a client app written in C# will be created using multi-threaded programming techniques. \n\n** More educational resources on open source development at http://marakana.com"
