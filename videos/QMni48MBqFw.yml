description: "RubyConf 2019 - Building a Ruby: Artichoke is a Ruby Made with Rust by Ryan Lopopolo\n\nArtichoke is a new Ruby implementation. Artichoke is written in Rust and aspires to be compatible with MRI Ruby 2.6.3. Artichoke is a platform that allows experimenting with VM implementations while providing a VM-agnostic implementation of Ruby Core and Standard Library. This talk will discuss Artichokeâ€™s history, architecture, goals, and implementation.\n\n#confreaks #rubyconf2019"
