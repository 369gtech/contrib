description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2013\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nDan North - Agile Troublemaker, Developer, Originator of BDD\n\nABSTRACT\nThus begins an old, and sadly lost in the mists of Usenet, love story about Vi and Ed (who becomes her \"ex\"), told entirely in Unix commands. I had no idea when I started learning these arcane (guess how the \"dd\" command got its name) and cryptic (what about \"grep\"?) Unix commands how incredibly useful they would become over the next two decades. If your primary OS is Linux or OSX on the desktop, and maybe iOS or Android on the move, you'll find this 40-something year joke (\"Unix\" itself was a bad pun) has managed to embed itself into every facet of your technological life.\n\nBeing comfortable at a shell prompt and having a healthy working knowledge of Unix commands and regular expressions will give you a whole new level of capability. In this fun talk I'll introduce a few commands and shell tricks you should have in your back pocket, and show you how to start taking control of your operating system. If you ask nicely I'll even tell you about the production system I wrote using Makefiles.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
