description: "Not so much time is left till the new major version of one of the most popular unit testing frameworks will be released – JUnit 5 is coming! \nIn this talk I will show you which new features this version will introduce, which possibilities we need to know to be ready for release, what kind of vision JUnit 5 assumes – not very deep in the code, just as overview what can be done with the power of All-new JUnit.
