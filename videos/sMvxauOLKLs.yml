title: 'Building a private CI/CD pipeline with Java and Docker in the Cloud'
language: English
recordingDate: 1492679011
description: "A private Java (Maven or Gradle) repository as a service can be setup in the cloud. A private Docker registry as a service can be easily setup in the cloud. But what if you want to build a holistic CI/CD pipeline, and on the cloud of YOUR choice?\n\nIn this talk Arun and Baruch will take you through steps of setting up a universal artifact repository, which can serve for both Java and Docker. You'll learn how to build a CI/CD pipeline with traceable metadata from the Java source files all the way to Docker images. Amazon, Azure, and Google Cloud (do you have setup that works on these?) will be used as an example although the recipes shown would be applicable to other cloud as well.\n\nBaruch Sadogursky (a.k.a JBaruch) is the Developer Advocate at JFrog. For a living he hangs out with JFrog’s tech leaders, writes code around the JFrog Platform and its ecosystem, and then speaks and blogs about it all. He has been doing this for the last dozen years or so, and enjoys every minute of it.\n\nBaruch is @jbaruch on twitter and mostly blogs on http://www.jfrog.com/blog/ and http://blog.bintray.com. He is a professional conference speaker on DevOps, Java and Groovy topics, and is a regular at the industry’s most prestigious events including JavaOne (where he was awarded a Rock Star award), DockerCon, Devoxx, DevOps Days, OSCON, Qcon and many others.\n\nArun Gupta is the vice president of developer advocacy at Couchbase. He has been building developer communities for 10+ years at Sun, Oracle, and Red Hat. He has deep expertise in leading cross-functional teams to develop and execute strategy, planning and execution of content, marketing campaigns, and programs.\n\nGupta has authored more than 2,000 blog posts on technology. He has extensive speaking experience in more than 40 countries on myriad topics and is a JavaOne Rock Star. Gupta also founded the Devoxx4Kids chapter in the US and continues to promote technology education among children. An author of a best-selling book, an avid runner, a Java Champion, and a JUG leader, Docker Captain, he is easily accessible at @arungupta."
