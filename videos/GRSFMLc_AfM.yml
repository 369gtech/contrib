title: 'Eve: Programming Reimagined'
recordingDate: 1484744201
description: "Programming has become increasingly complex and hard to handle. It feels like we are fighting the computer to accomplish even the simplest task. But does it have to be this way? \n\nWhat if your programs were just a collection of facts that you queried? What if the database wasn't external to your program but an integral part of it? What if regardless of the order of statements in your program it would always be the same output? What if you could ask the program why it got a certain value and it would point to the place where it got it from? \n\nWelcome to Eve, a reimagining of programming. \n\nBring a computer because we will be learning by doing. \n\nRuben Niculcea from the Carnegie Museumâ€™s Innovation Studio presented live on Jan 17, 2017 at Code & Supply in Pittsburgh, PA.
