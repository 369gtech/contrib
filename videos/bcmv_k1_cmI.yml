description: "Speaker:  Lionel Chok\n\nNo one could have guessed what was on Mark Zuckerberg's mind when Facebook acquired Oculus for $2 billion back in 2014. Not until a year later, when 360 videos became a news feed feature on Facebook's wall, Google Cardboards shipped over 5 million; and Virtual Reality became a buzz word across industries and investors.\n\nJust what is the hype behind 360 and Virtual Reality? More importantly - can you be part of it? How technical is the progress and what does it entail?\n\nIn this hour-long session, VR Technologist Lionel Chok will attempt to answer some of the above, demo some of his works, as well as how to get you started in the live action 360 and VR space, plus also differentiate those in CG, Animation and Gaming.\n\nEvent Page: https://www.facebook.com/events/1547724118867473\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/MlfO/"
