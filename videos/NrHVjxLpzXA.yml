See http://fitc.ca for details.\n\nOverview\nIn the last few years, we’ve seen an emergence of a modular way of thinking about code and design. We’ve seen the rise of SMACSS, BEM, and Atomic Design. This talk will look at those modular concepts and how they can streamline development for large and long-running projects. We’ll also look at how these approaches can ease responsive design and development. Lastly, we will look at where the modular approach is going in the future as Web Components slowly make their way into browsers and application frameworks.\n\nJonathan Snook\nWeb Developer, Snook.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/snookca\nhttps://instagram.com/snookca\nhttps://github.com/snookca\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
