description: "When you work with a large project or team over time, you either develop an airtight system for writing CSS or you spend half your day deciphering mystery code while fighting specificity battles.\n\nAfter a lengthy process of investigating systems like BEM, OOCSS, SMACSS and more, we decided to take pieces of each and create our own. This talk is not the announcement of a new system we want you to use, instead it’s a deep dive into the discussions and decision-making that happened as we developed one.\n\nYou’ll walk away with an understanding of how you might go about choosing a CSS methodology or developing one of your own, and get a first-hand look at the complexity management problems faced by today’s larger projects.\n\nDave Shea\nVP, User Experience, Mobify\nhttps://twitter.com/mezzoblue\nhttps://github.com/mezzoblue\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
