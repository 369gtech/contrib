description: "Scrum master’s story – from Shu to Ha. (A lot of pain included)\n\nThis is my very personal story about how I did change my way of working. It’ll be useful to any change agents in organisation – perhaps you’ll know yourself in my thoughts and it’ll help you to boost up your personal growth. Otherwise – you’ll listen to emotional and sometimes funny story. It would be please to me if you’ll join my story as a listener."
