description: "Drupal's front-end architecture has become quite complex over the past years. Even though the theming experience has gotten a lot better, it still doesn’t fit into the expected workflow that many front-end developers now follow. In addition, organizations using Drupal are having a hard time finding front-end Drupal talent, as compared with JavaScript talent.\n\nAt the same time, expectations from users are growing at a striking speed. To accommodate these needs, front-end developers are inventing new tools to make their lives easier. Nonetheless, it's difficult to try to always provide the right tools since different problems need different solutions. As a result, many initiatives around decoupled Drupal have been gaining momentum.\n\nThe key questions that we want to discuss on this core conversation are:\n\nShould we as a community put more focus on decoupling than trying to create a monolithic application that could solve all different aspects of front-end development?\n\nIf Drupal is being used for decoupled purposes, there is quite some unnecessary complexity that comes from the subsystems that are not required for decoupling. How could we reduce that complexity?\n\nIs not decoupling even an option? Do we believe that there would be one solution that could work for everyone?\n\nWe don’t have answers to these questions yet, so please join the conversation!"
