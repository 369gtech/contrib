title: '#DCBerlin18 406 Corti The Curious Case of Android Button DAY1'
recordingDate: 1534021448
description: "Nicola Corti, Android Engineer, Yelp Inc.\n\nTHE CURIOUS CASE OF ANDROID BUTTON\nIntermediate / Design / UI/UX / Talk\n\nWe interact with buttons every day to get coffee, order pizza, or start a new Gradle build. They may look simple and straightforward, but they have a fundamental role in our environment: create a sense of power. We all love to feel empowered and we all hate being frustrated by bad design. Your users know this as well, they want to feel immediately rewarded when they interact with your UI, and they will quickly drop your app if they get annoyed. At Yelp, we get tens of millions button clicks a day. At that kind of scale, every pixel matters. We tune every single aspect of our buttons to make them simple and powerful, but adjusting every single shadow cast, click animation, or color layer can be tricky. In this talk, we will provide a deep dive into the Android framework and the Support Library to understand how buttons are rendered."
