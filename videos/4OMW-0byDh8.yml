title: 'Adam Trimble: Pwas - Beyond Beginnings: Service Workers at Scale  | March 2020'
language: Spanish
recordingDate: 1597958857
description: 'I want to talk about what service workers look like at scale. We''ve been working on our PWA at GOAT, and many of the articles online about service workers are simple "get started" tutorials. There hasn''t been a lot of discussion about the problems, solutions, pitfalls, etc of deploying service workers to apps with high traffic and complex CI/CD. We would cover cache invalidation, quota storage limits, SWs on testing environments, SWs behind authentication, and other things we''ve run into.'
