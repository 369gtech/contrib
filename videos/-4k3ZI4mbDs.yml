description: "In this talk, we are going to look at what web components are, including upcoming additions like lit-html & Shadow parts.\n\nThen we will take a look at how easy it is to create web components with Angular. One of the main reasons for this is because of all the tooling that the Angular platform provides for us.\n\nOnce we have created these web components we will then walk through how to add them to different projects."
