description: "NOTE : if you know how the Pokémon game works skip to 4 mins in. \nCORRECTION : Richard refers to 750 Pokémon being available,he confused total Pokémon (722 according to Wikipedia July 2016) with those available in the game (\"more than a hundred\" according to Pokémon.com July 2016)\n\nWhy does Pikachu sometimes pop up in inappropriate places? 'Phone zombies' glued to their devices at major landmarks, are probably playing Pokémon GO. Richard Wetzel from the MRL (University of Nottingham) and intLab; (University of Lincoln) takes us through it.\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/computerphile\nhttps://twitter.com/computer_phile\n\nThis video was filmed and edited by Sean Riley.\n\nComputer Science at the University of Nottingham: http://bit.ly/nottscomputer\n\nComputerphile is a sister project to Brady Haran's Numberphile.
