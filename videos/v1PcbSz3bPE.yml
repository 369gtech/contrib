title: 'Kicking up the Dust with NodeJS and a Bunch of Other JavaScript Goodness'
recordingDate: 1376330634
description: "Bill Scott joined PayPal 1.5 yrs back from Netflix. The first thing he noticed was a number of technology choices had been made that inhibited rapid development, experimentation and productivity. The first technology that Bill & his team brought into house was dustjs. The next major technology was the introduction of nodejs. Simultaneously, a number of other open source technologies were incorporated (LESS, requirejs, backbone, twitter bootstrap, bower, etc.). In progress now is a project internally called \"Kraken\" in which nodejs is being made a full production stack at PayPal. This latter effort will be the subject of Bill's keynote: \"Clash of the Titans: Releasing the Kraken | NodeJS @paypal\"\n\nWhat has been the effect of this? These technologies have enabled both Lean UX and Lean Engineering to take hold. A whole set of new experiences for developers, consumers and merchants are being built and released in a way & speed that was not possible before. In this webcast, Bill will lay out how JavaScript is front and center to this new revolution in progress.\nAbout Bill Scott\n\nBill Scott is the Sr. Director of UI Engineering at PayPal.
