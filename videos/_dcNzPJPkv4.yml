recordingDate: 1545239106
description: 'DevOps is a hot topic during last several years. Some companies, teams and products have achieved quite impressive results in this area making cultural changes, transforming their processes and practices, introducing new roles, tools and techniques. At the same time there is no common approach for measuring achievements and understanding “how DevOps” the current team/company is. In this talk I will provide attendees with basic checklist to start with and some reliable tools/techniques to monitor progress of “DevOps transformation”.'
