description: "HTTP2 is here to solve all our performance woes. Well, not quite, even on websites that enable it, a significant proportion of traffic uses the older, slower protocol. It’s our job as web developers to account for both.\n\nEverything just got a whole lot more complicated.\n\nDiscover some of the techniques available to developers during this transitional period, the new catches in HTTP2 and – importantly – how to keep your visitors from giving up before your site even loads.\n\nPeter Wilson is a web developer with 20 years experience. He has a healthy obsession with CSS, PHP and keeping the web fast.\n\nPeter is an engineer at Human Made where he makes websites that scale. He has worked on a range of sites for companies over three continents.\n\nFor more on YOW! West, visit http://west.yowconference.com.au"
