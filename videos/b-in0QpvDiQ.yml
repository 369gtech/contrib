description: 'Codemotion Milan 2015 - "CSS3 Layouts: Flexbox vs CSS Grid" by Sara Vieira - The way we create layouts is messy we have to admit it, those floats and inline-block''s don''t make anyone''s life any easier and they aren''t exactly tools for creating massive layouts, just properties we adapted for our layout needs because, well, they worked and we got used to them. With CSS3 we got Flexbox and the CSS grid , two things created especially for the creation of layouts , in here I will talk about each one, the pros , the cons and why you should be looking forward to using these in production. All of this so you can go home with even more hope for the future of CSS.'
