description: "TestCon Vilnius 2016. Software Testing & QA Conference. \nOctober 21, 2016 | www.testcon.lt\n\nHow can we manage quality? How can we reach the top in Quality? How do metrics fit in that picture?\n\nIn this talk, the practical guidance will be provided and personal experiences will be shared on the process improvement tracks based on metrics in order to make a step upwards in finding the top in Quality. By comparing key metrics used in two different software development lifecycle models, it will be explained why metrics are useful and how can they be a thread for improvement instead of a treat."
