description: "John Resig (Mozilla Corporation), \n\nWorking on the development of jQuery one tends to learn about all the\nperformance implications of a particular change to a JavaScript code\nbase (whether it be from an API change or a larger internals rewrite).\nPerformance is an ever-present concern for every single commit and for\nevery release. Performance implications must be well-defended and\nwell-tested."
