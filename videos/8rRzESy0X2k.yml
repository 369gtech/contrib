description: 'While often conflated with its syntax, Datalog is actually the system defining the set of semantics used by many database query languages, including SQL, SPARQL, and Datomic queries. However, Datalog also defines semantics for “Production Rules”, allowing logic programs to be executed similarly to Prolog.'
