description: "Panel: Fifty Shades of Grey: Different Models for Reliability Work\n\nFernanda Weiden, Facebook; Stephanie Dean, Dropbox; David Barr, Twitter; Abe Hassan, Google\n\nThere are many different approaches for reliability work, and different needs depending on each company's needs and infrastructure. One might spend time dealing with private clouds, public clouds, in-house software, third-party software, developing, watching, instrumenting, and debugging. Sometimes we need to build, sometimes we need to optimize, sometimes we need to un-break things.\n\nHow do we build teams that adapt to the different needs, and how can we hire effectively for each one of those cases? What are the different approaches we can take for the work? In this panel we'll discuss some of that, and compare different approaches from different organizations actively working on systems reliability.\n\nView the full SREcon15 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon15/program"
