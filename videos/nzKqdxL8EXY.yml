title: 'Nikita Lipsky - JIT vs. AOT: Unity And Conflict of Dynamic and Static Compilers for Java'
language: English
recordingDate: 1497006137
description: "Java had been constantly criticized for poor performance ever since its inception, but not so much in recent years. Thanks to optimizing dynamic native code compilers, Java performance today is very close to the performance of low level languages ​​such as C/C++, and is even better on some classes of applications. Along with dynamic compilers, static compilers for Java have been evolving as well, so there is still no clear winner among these two approaches. It should then come as no surprise that an AOT compiler is finally going to appear even in the HotSpot JVM and OpenJDK via JEP-295, which is officially included in Java 9.\n\nIn this session, I would like to dispel common myths around the old dispute on whether dynamic or static compilation is better, show that both approaches have their strengths and weaknesses, and explain why the future is the hybrid approach."
