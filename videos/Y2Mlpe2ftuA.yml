title: 'That''s How You Scale MICROSERVICES'
language: English
recordingDate: 1526306403
description: "While moving to a microservices architecture provides many benefits, it also brings up a slew of challenges. Unlike monolithic architectures, microservice architectures have to deal with coordinating, organizing, and managing a collection of different services with different scaling needs. On top of these, each microservice needs a lightweight, efficient, and maintainable API to facilitate the high level of communication between services. \n\nI’ll show you how Kubernetes and gRPC, two open source projects based on experience Google has gained running microservices at scale, can help solve these problems!\n\nKubernetes lets you manage and orchestrate Containers over a fleet of machines as if they were running on a single computer. With Kubernetes, it’s easy to create, run, and scale microservices independently while providing an easy way for them to communicate with each other. \n\ngRPC is a language and platform-neutral RPC framework, based on HTTP/2 and Protobuf, used to build highly performant and scalable APIs. gRPC benefits from new features introduced in HTTP/2 like framing, bidirectional streaming, header compression, multiplexing, and flow control. gRPC is not just a blueprint for high performance RPC, but also provides a toolset to generate services and clients in multiple languages.\n\nIn this talk, I’ll demo the core concepts of gRPC and Kubernetes, and show you how to combine these two technologies to create scalable and performant microservices rooted in lessons learned from Google’s experience!\n\nEVENT:\n\nNodeJS Interactive 2016\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nSandeep Dinesh, Google\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nThe Linux Foundation provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsIwYL-N4vI"
