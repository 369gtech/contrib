description: "Recording brought to you by American Express. https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs\nDomain-specific languages (DSLs) are a great way to create beautifully readable code. This session will explore why Kotlin's syntax lends itself to creating elegant DSLs by examining how to build a full-stack web app with:\n- #Ktor to create an asynchronous backend\n- Exposed to develop a data access layer\n- kotlinx.html to build a frontend\n\nI will introduce each framework/library briefly, illustrate the DSL using examples, and explain why itâ€™s an example of a great DSL. By the end of the session, you will have a new appreciation of the beautiful DSLs that can be created using Kotlin!\n\nResources:\nKotlinConf website: https://jb.gg/fyaze5\nKotlinConf on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlinconf\n\nKotlin website: https://jb.gg/pxrsn6\nKotlin blog: https://jb.gg/7uc7ow\nKotlin on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlin\n\n#KotlinConf19 #Kotlin #JetBrains #DSL\n\nAbout the Presenter:\nPamela is a second-generation coder and holds BSc IT and BSc (Hons) Computer Science degrees from the University of Pretoria, South Africa.
