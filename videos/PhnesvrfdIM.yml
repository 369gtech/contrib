description: "Google I/O 2009 - Building Applications with Google APIs\r\n\r\nRay Cromwell\r\n\r\nGoogle offers a wide variety of APIs in many domains that together form a complete platform, from authentication and authorization, cloud computing, and social networking, to visualization, mobile computing, and Google Web Toolkit. In this talk, we will walk though a complex application that integrates many APIs together, how each can solve a different need in your application, how you can share code between GWT, Android, and App Engine, and how you can monetize your application with Google Checkout.\r\n\r\nFor presentation slides and all I/O sessions, please go to: code.google.com/events/io/sessions.html"
