title: 'YOW! Lambda Jam 2018 - Tom Sydney Kerckhove - Signature inference for functional property discovery'
recordingDate: 1533708000
description: "Property discovery is the process of discovering properties of code via automated testing. It has the potential to be a great tool for a practical approach to software correctness. Unfortunately current methods remain infeasible because of the immense search space. We contribute a new approach to taming the complexity of a state-of-the-art generate and test algorithm. Our approach runs this algorithm several times with carefully chosen inputs of smaller size: signature inference. We implement this approach in a new tool called EasySpec. The results suggest that this approach is several orders of magnitude faster, fast enough to be practical, and produces similar results.\n\nTom is interested in software that works. In particular, He focuses on (property) testing and devops.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
