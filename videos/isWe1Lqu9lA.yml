recordingDate: 1557862089
description: 'Sometimes it can be hard to get ''buy in'' from investors or management when you have an idea for an AI application. You can talk about the idea, maybe produce some mock-ups, possibly walk through your algorithm design? But … wouldn''t it be brilliant to provide your team with a Proof-of-Concept application, infused with intelligence, that took you the fraction of the time to build? Could showing something ‘real’ really test the viability of an idea and gain buy-in for further development? In this interview, Amy will show you how she has built a prototype application infused with intelligence using Azure Platform-as- a-Service (PaaS) offerings such as Azure Custom Vision service, Azure Logic Apps and Microsoft PowerApps''s platforms. By linking these services together you can build reliable, scalable AI applications and get your customers testing them as soon as possible. In this interview, Amy will show you how she has built a prototype application infused with intelligence using Azure Platform-as- a-Service (PaaS) offerings such as Azure Custom Vision service, Azure Logic Apps and Microsoft PowerApps''s platforms.
