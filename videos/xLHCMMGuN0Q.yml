description: "Let's use an evolutionary algorithm to improve a Tetris AI! We'll be coding this in Javascript (gasp) because I want to try something different. Through the process of selection, crossover, and mutation our AI will eventually be able to reach the high score of 500 in record time.\n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/How_to_make_an_evolutionary_tetris_bot\n\nPlease Subscribe!
