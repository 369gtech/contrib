description: 'After joining Wix three years ago, I was exposed to the amazing world of Scala. While the maturity and wide range of tools Java offers is great, the language doesn’t seem to keep up with market requirements as other languages do. In Scala the code is much more concise, less ceremonious, immutable by default, combines functional with object oriented, seamlessly interoperates with Java and the JVM ecosystem, and many software engineering patterns are already baked into the language. Most importantly – Scala is FUN. By the end of the session you too will, hopefully, convert to Scala and never look back.'
