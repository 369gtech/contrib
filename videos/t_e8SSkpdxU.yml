This session will concentrate on presenting new features and capabilities as well as focus on day 2 operations and troubleshooting. We will also have a detailed discussion on our future roadmap, key functionality that we want to enable, and open the floor for Q&A with customers and members of the SIG-Windows community. Some familiarity with Windows on Kubernetes is required for the deep dive part since we will have an in-depth discussion on key features that are in the pipeline for Windows, explain their implementation and have a discussion on trade-offs with the community. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UagU"
