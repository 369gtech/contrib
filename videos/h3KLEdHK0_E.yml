description: "O'Reilly Strata Online Conference\nMoving to Big Data\n\nThis Strata Online Conference has ended. A recording of the program is available for viewing until March 7, 2012. Registration(free) is required to access the recording.\n\nEveryone buys in to the mantra of the data-driven enterprise. Companies that put data to work make smarter decisions than their competitors. They can engage customers, employees, and partners more effectively. And they can adapt faster to changing market conditions. It's not just internal data, either: a social, connected web has given us new firehoses to drink from, and combining public and private data yields valuable new insights.\n\nUnfortunately for many businesses, the information they need is languishing in data warehouses. It's accessible only to Business Intelligence experts and database experts. It's encased in legacy databases with arcane interfaces.\n\nBig Data promises to unlock this data for the entire company. But getting there will be hard: replacing decades-old platforms and entire skill sets doesn't happen overnight. In this online event, we'll look at how Big Data stacks and analytical approaches are gradually finding their way into organizations, as well as the roadblocks that can thwart efforts to become more data-driven.\n\nPart 6: How to Get There from Here: The Road to Enterprise Data (15m)\nLynn Langit (Teaching Kids Programming)\n\nHow will companies familiar with BI and SQL gradually embrace unstructured data and noSQL models? Will this be through a \"layer\" of SQL emulation? Through an Excel plug-in that generates Hadoop workloads? A rethinking on the part of database vendors? Or something else entirely?\n\nIn this session, cloud and data expert Lynn Langit explores the roadmap to Big Data adoption by traditional enterprise IT and corporate software developers."
