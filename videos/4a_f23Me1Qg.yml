description: 'Wireless Networks (Wifi) are the most used type of network nowadays and most people don''t know really how vulnerable they are, even WPA/WPA2 Enterprise. In this workshop we will cover most wifi encryptions being used today, how they work behind the scenes and the theory of the cracking process. Also, you will be able to apply this knowledge on the spot with some real-life-scenario wifi networks. Some encryptions are mathematically difficult to crack, where the cracking process could take lifetimes. But not to worry, there still are ways to get around this with an attack called Man-in-the-middle (MITM). Be wary! You never know to whom''s Internet Access Point you''re connecting and who''s eavesdropping on you. Ever wondered how to get somebody''s passwords of a website? After this workshop you will be able to supplant a website without the victim ever knowing it with Wifiphishing or DNS Spoofing the client''s router.'
