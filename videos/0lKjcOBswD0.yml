Where are they headed?\"\r\n\r\n\"The stairs… no… maintenance.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's not us! We're safe, right?\"\r\n\r\n\"They're sabotaging us. Room scanner offline. We've lost visual on the corridor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did... Did you just hear that noise?\"\r\n\r\n\"Forget the console; barricade that door... NOW!\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\"Room Service\" is a physically immersive, multi-player, horror escape room created by Pop Up Playground in Melbourne, Australia, and constructed using arduino-compatible processors, C++, and open source software and hardware designs.\r\n\r\nWe'll examine how to build a physically immersive game, hardware used, embedded testing frameworks, the platformio software development environment, player creations, software challenges, and improvements over time."
