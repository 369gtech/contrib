title: '12 Factor MicroServices - Andy Davies'
recordingDate: 1535378006
description: "Whether we want to deploy our applications inside a Docker container, as a Lambda function, a cloud provided VM, or onto bare metal, the same questions come up over and over again: How do I handle Configuration? What about Logging? or Concurrency? and many others.\nThe 12 Factor methodology helps answer all these questions, and provides a \"recipe for success\". Originally developed by people targeting Heroku, we can use the same methodology with our .net applications to provide all the deployment, scalability and stability benefits too.\n\nIn this talk, we will create an ASP.NET Core application which fulfills the 12 Factor requirements and go through why each of the requirements matter, and what impact they have on the rest of your ecosystem."
