description: "You won’t win if you keep doing the same thing over and over again. And you won’t be world-class if just you do what others have done before you. To truly make it, you need to be different and develop a world-class innovation mindset!\n\nIn the world of professional sports, innovation, persistence and rapid learning are everything! In this very personal talk I, a former Olympian, will share key learnings from my professional sports career. I will delve into topics such as choosing the team that’s right for you, rapid feedback, radical candour and high-performance teams.\n\nI will contrast the perspectives and attitudes of professional sports with modern work life and will extract guidelines and tools that we can apply to our professional lives. From critical communication skills to collaboration and effective teams, come along and learn practical ways for how to apply ideas from Olympic sports to your professional agile career!\n\nSandy is an Agile consultant at Nomad8 with a focus on culture and leadership. She moved to New Zealand in 2007 (for a brief trial period) and has been living in Wellington and Auckland ever since. From working with global enterprises in Amsterdam, Stockholm and Copenhagen to being one of NZ’s leading coaches, she brings a practical flair and passionate advocacy for all things Agile to businesses around the world. She is a former Olympian, a geek, a gadget junkie, international speaker and knows quite a lot about Agile.\n\nFor more on YOW! conferences, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
