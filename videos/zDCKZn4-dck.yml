description: "Filmed at https://2017.dotgo.eu on November 6th in Paris. More talks on https://dotconferences.com/talks\n\nBill learned over time that itâ€™s best to forget about how channels are structured and focus on how they behave. So now when it comes to channels, he thinks about one thing: signaling.\n\nA channel allows one goroutine to signal another goroutine about a particular event. Signaling is at the core of everything you should be doing with channels.\n\nThinking of channels as a signaling mechanism will allow you to write better code with well defined and more precise behavior."
