recordingDate: 1575469982
description: 'Continuous integration and deployment is the working tool for a sales force in 22 different countries. A talk about how we outgrew detailed specifications and rigid structures, and replaced them with transparency and a better common understanding of what we are trying to do accomplish, and the tools we are using. Most importantly; what we have learned about reducing friction.'
