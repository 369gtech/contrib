description: "In most of the world, the lock market is pretty unremarkable. However, there is a whole other world of lock designs that are sold exclusively to the Chinese domestic market. This presentation will discuss a variety of topics regarding Chinese mechanical lock designs, from the unique dynamics of the market that fostered these designs, to flaws present in these designs, as well as how we can use some of these principles present in these locks for use in other situations.\n\nLucas Zhao (UrbanHawk) is a 19-year-old lockpicker (albeit a mediocre one) with a special interest in Chinese locks, and an avid collector of locks from all over the world. He has been dissecting and researching locks since he was 10 years of age, and has a fairly comprehensive knowledge of all things related to locks. He loves to talk endlessly about his lock interests to anyone who will listen, much to the annoyance of his friends, who now avoid actively avoid him. He currently attends Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, OH as an undergraduate student.\n\nTwitter: @TheUrbanHawk"
