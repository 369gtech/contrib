description: "To kick off this 20-city Oracle Code tour on March 1, Oracle President of Product Development Thomas Kurian offered Oracle’s three-point vision for developers during his keynote at the sold-out event in San Francisco. The vision, according to Kurian:\n\nOracle platform as a service provides APIs or a GUI for developers to create a software-defined virtual data center that can be up and running in the cloud within minutes, by instantiating compute, storage, and network elements. And developers can bring their own IP address ranges to the cloud to extend their applications and data centers seamlessly to the cloud.\nOracle is providing a complete development platform to automate the software supply chain, allowing developers to focus on their code while the platform administers itself (from installation, patching, and configuration to backing up and encrypting data) using software and machine learning. “We provision the stack, scale it, back it up, encrypt it—we do all those functions,” Kurian said.\nFinally, developers can bring their modules of code, and Oracle’s platform as a service takes care of scaling the code and meeting required SLAs without developers having to worry about scaling the underlying infrastructure. “Infrastructure as a service over time becomes invisible because you do not have to worry about the infrastructure your code is being deployed and scaled upon,” Kurian said. “You should be able to deploy every minute or every hour.”"
