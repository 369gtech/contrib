Yet what about when languages appear similar? What then?\n\nIn this talk, we will compare Go and Elixir. These languages have similar principles but make core tradeoffs that affect when one might use them. We will specifically compare their concurrency paradigms to see what we might use when.\n\nRead the full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/anna-neyzberg/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - ANNA NEYZBERG\nFounding ElixirBridge\n\nAnna is a San Francisco native who has done a lot of work in the ruby community in SF and currently sits on the board of RailsBridge.
