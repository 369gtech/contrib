description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nScaling Kubernetes Networking Beyond 100k Endpoints - Rob Scott & Minhan Xia, Google \n\nAs Kubernetes continues to grow, scalability is increasingly important. One of the key bottlenecks that emerged as clusters got larger was related to network endpoints. They became quite slow at scale, and had limitations preventing them from growing beyond approximately 5,000 endpoints per Service.  In this talk, Rob will show how the scalability of network endpoints has been dramatically increased in Kubernetes. He’ll cover the design and implementation of EndpointSlices, along with the impact they’ve had. He’ll walk through the process of profiling key components in the Kubernetes codebase to identify areas that could be optimized. Finally, he’ll show how all this work has improved Kubernetes network scalability, including real world performance metrics from large clusters with over 100,000 endpoints.\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zeta"
