title: 'Building a Scalable News Feed/Inbox System with MongoDB and Java'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433518948
description: "Many user-facing applications present some kind of news feed/inbox system. You can think of Facebook, Twitter, or Gmail as different types of inboxes where the user can see data of interest, sorted by time, popularity, or other parameter. A scalable inbox is a difficult problem to solve: for millions of users, varied data from many sources must be sorted and presented within milliseconds. Different strategies can be used: scatter-gather, fan-out writes, and so on. This session presents an actual application developed by 10gen in Java, using MongoDB. This application is open source and is intended to show the reference implementation of several strategies to tackle this common challenge. The presentation also introduces many MongoDB concepts.\n\n\nAuthor:\nantoine girbal\nAntoine works on MongoDB core apps and the Java driver. He previously spent many years in the CDN industry, at Panther CDN then CDNetworks, designing and developing one of the largest and fastest Content Delivery and Application Acceleration Network. Prior work include the development of a new network protocol in Linux kernel to multiplex several interfaces, used in wireless devices. Antoine received a MS degree in Computer Science from Stevens Institute (Hoboken), and a BS in Computer Science from Epita (Paris France).\nView more trainings by antoine girbal at https://www.parleys.com/author/antoine-girbal\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
