description: "Kube Your Enthusiasm — Bringing the `CF Push` Experience to Kubernetes Operators (Project Eirini) - Julz Friedman & Julian Skupnjak, IBM\n\nIs container scheduling commoditised yet?\n\nThe Eirini project (now an “official” incubator project in the Runtime PMC) is bringing pluggable container scheduling to the Cloud Foundry Application Runtime. In other words: the `cf push` developer experience we all love, with your choice of container orchestrator - including Kubernetes - under the covers. \n\nThis session will introduce the Eirini project, talk through the reasons behind it, and tell you what it means for your developers (not much) and your operators (for many of them, quite a lot!). \n\nWe’re also going to demo getting up and running with Eirini on Kubernetes using a single Helm chart. This way you - and your Kubernetes-loving friends and colleagues! - can try out the `cf push` developer experience, going from code to first-class Deployments, Pods and Services in your existing Kubernetes cluster, all in a single command!\n\nhttps://cfseu18.sched.com/event/FRy8/kube-your-enthusiasm-bringing-the-cf-push-experience-to-kubernetes-operators-project-eirini-julz-friedman-julian-skupnjak-ibm"
