description: "Google Tech Talks\r\nJanuary, 31 2008\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nBeing creative and successful in business and your personal lives requires that you be responsive and flexible as you move beyond your comfort zones. \r\n\r\nThough it may seem paradoxical, all real change and creativity begins by facing and understanding the reality of your current situation. \r\n\r\nLearning to see and respond with greater clarity is where the path toward change and growth begins. \r\n\r\nWhat is that you are really doing? What are you doing that is extraneous? How can you bring more ease to and at the same time enliven your work and personal activities?\r\n\r\nLearn how slowing down and looking deeply can lead to greater business success and personal satisfaction. Learn key practices that can help you: \r\n\r\nBe flexible and responsive in the midst of change\r\nAct with calm in the midst of intense activity\r\nRelax in the midst of exertion\r\nGain clarity and insight in the midst of difficulty and competing demands\r\nIncrease creativity and problem-solving skills\r\nImprove listening and communication skills\r\nImprove focus and concentration\r\nIncrease work satisfaction\r\nLead and build teams\r\n\r\nSpeaker: Marc Lesser\r\nI integrate best practices from business strategy and leadership development with mindfulness practices to help individuals and teams develop greater flexibility and responsiveness in their work and lives, leading to more creativity, productivity, and financial security. My focus is on deep and lasting authenticity and leadership.  I am the founder and former CEO of a publishing company and a long-term Zen teacher.
