title: 'Hands-On Lab using Oracle Machine Learning AutoML UI on Autonomous Database'
language: English
recordingDate: 1622583784
description: "In this Hands on Lab, we experienced Oracle Machine Learning AutoML UI on Oracle Autonomous Database.\n\nAutoML UI provides the features of OML Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) for algorithm selection, adaptive sampling, feature selection and hyperparameter tuning.\n\nAutoML UI allows for an automatic creation of a OML4Py Notebook with content for the best tuned model and all hyperparameters chosen by AutoML for the model desired.\n\nAutoML UI also deploys Models to OML Services with one click, which creates REST APIs for the native in-database OML models and makes them ready to score in real-time.\n\nSign up for this tour of OML AutoML UI, and we will distribute credentials for you to do the Live exercises using the environment during the Session.\n\nVideo Highlights:\n00:33 Goals for the HOL Session\n01:20 Expectations for the HOL Session\n02:10 Agenda\n03:35 Accessing the Live Labs Instance\n09:55 Introduction to OML AutoML UI\n15:38 Performance considerations for OML AutoML UI\n17:38 OML expected Workflow\n19:36 Preparing the Live Labs environment\n21:30 Labs overview\n22:47 Lab 1 - Access OML Notebooks and create your first model using OML AutoML UI\n40:38 Lab 1 - Q&A\n43:30 Lab 2 - Create an auto-generated OML Notebook from your first model\n49:55 Lab 2 - Bonus Rounds - additional Prediction and Probabilities in OML4Py\n54:37 Lab 3 - Deploy and AutoML UI model to REST API on OML Services\n59:08 Lab 4 - Create a second Experiment with more models and Recall model metric\n1:06:43 Lab 5 - Run AutoML using OML4Py as a comparison\n1:14:59 Lab 6 - Bonus Section: Use Postman to access OML Services REST APIs to score the OML AutoML UI model deployments\n1:16:38 Where to go from here?\n1:17:37 Q&A"
