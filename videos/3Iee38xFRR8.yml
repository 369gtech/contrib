description: "JSLA Thursday June 28, 2012 7pm - Igor Minar @IgorMinar\nWhat if you could write modern web apps with dramatically fewer lines of code and improve its readability and expressiveness at the same time? No, there’s no new language to learn. Just familiar old HTML and JavaScript. As a matter of fact, there’s some stuff for you to un-learn.\n\nAngularJS is a client-side JavaScript web development framework where we believe we’ve done something special. We’ve approached the problem let’s say differently from the way any other JavaScript tool has before. Instead of asking what kind of functions we could provide to make writing apps smoother, we asked “what if the browser worked differently in a way that eliminates code and gives structure to apps?”\n\nThis talk will take the audience on a tour of what the web platform of the future will look like and how the AngularJS framework can provide many of the powerful capabilities to existing browsers and bridge the path to web components, model driven views and other platform features that are currently being spec-ed."
