description: "This video was recorded at virtual Code BEAM V America conference, which took place on 10-12th March 2021 - https://codesync.global/conferences/code-beam-v-america-2021/\n\nMore great virtual tech conferences - https://codesync.global​ \n\n---\n\nHistory of philosophy of Erlang with its creators\nby Bjarne Däcker, Mike Williams, Robert Virding, \nhost: Garrett Smith \n\nABSTRACT\nGarrett Smith will host a fireside chat with Erlang co-inventors Mike Williams and Robert Virding, and the co-founder and former head of the Ericsson Computer Science Lab Bjarne Dacker. In his fireside, Garrett will be exploring the Erlang rationale, understanding how to drive innovation aimed at solving specific problems, and moving the results from a research institution to a commercial entity. As with previous fireside chats with Erlang-co inventors, expect lots of nuggets, anecdotes and stories explaining how, 30 years on, Erlang is still leading the way in the space of concurrency, distributed programming, resilience and scale. \n---\n\nSPEAKER - Bjarne Däcker\nFormer manager of the Computer Science Laboratory at Ericsson\nBjarne Däcker worked 36 years at Ericsson, first as programmer and systems designer and the last 18 years as manager of the Computer Science Laboratory. http://www.cs-lab.org/\n\nBjarne Däcker holds a licentiate of technology from the Royal Institute of Technology and an honorary doctorate from Linköping university. He was chairman of the steering committee for the Swedish national program for Computer Science research for five years. Bjarne has also been Swedish representative on the committee for EU’s IT prize. He is a member of the Swedish Royal Academy of the Engineering Sciences.As a pensioner, Bjarne Däcker has taken up university studies and has a B.A. in Archaeology.\n\nSPEAKER - Mike Williams\nErlang co-inventor\nAfter leaving school in Wales, Milke worked as a school teacher in Malawi. He wasn’t a very good teacher, so he returned to Cambridge where he completed an engineering degree. He moved to Stockholm (with his Swedish wife) where he got a job working for Ericsson, the telecommunications giant. He had many jobs at Ericsson, starting as a hardware developer making him one of the few people who to design and implemented a computer from basic chips! Having developed a computer, the next stage was to program it, so he slipped into software development, eventually co-founding the Ericsson Computer Science laboratory. His principle achievement as co-inventor of Erlang was the implementation of the first Erlang virtual machine and the error handling constructs in Erlang's concurrency model. From applied research, he slipped into management of both small and large business units which developed and maintained software, both in Erlang and other technologies. Building and managing good teams for software development is, perhaps, the most important aspect for any non trivial development. It is what he is going to speak about.\n\nSPEAKER - Robert Virding\nCo-Creator of Erlang\nRobert Virding is Principal Language Expert at Erlang Solutions Ltd. While at Ericsson AB, Robert was one of the original members of the Ericsson Computer Science Lab, and co-inventor of the Erlang language. He took part in the original system design and contributed much of the original libraries, as well as to the current compiler. While at the lab he also did a lot of work on the implementation of logic and functional languages and on garbage collection. He has also worked as an entrepreneur and was one of the co-founders of one of the first Erlang startups (Bluetail). Robert also worked a number of years at the Swedish Defence Materiel Administration (FMV) Modelling and Simulations Group. He co-authored the first book (Prentice-Hall) on Erlang, and is regularly invited to teach and present throughout the world.\n---\n\nCode BEAM V America\nWebsite: https://codesync.global/conferences/code-beam-v-america-2021/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/CodeBEAMio"
