description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nSponsored Session: AppDynamics - Path to Kubernetes Observability - Jeffrey Holmes, AppDynamics\n\nBy accessing this sponsored session, the third party sponsor will receive some of your registration data. This data includes your First Name, Last Name, Title, Company, Address, Email, Standard Demographics Questions (I.e. Company Size, Job Function, Industry), and details about the sponsored content you interacted with.

This is an on-demand session and will be available for the duration of the event.    Achieving observability for services, including those running in the cloud, is no small undertaking. Using cloud-native services brings many monitoring challenges. Developers have unique observability requirements to capture data from multiple metric sources from containers, deployment methods. AppDynamics has made significant improvements to automate agent deployment for Kubernetes and non-containerized VM/bare-metal applications to simplify the potentially complex operational and monitoring challenges. Our APM agents offer a full set of features around tracing, dynamic instrumentation, and AI/ML-based root cause analysis. The all-new AppDynamics Kubernetes Cluster agent supports the ability to capture log snippets and associate with container events. Automatically instrument APM for Java, Node.js, and .NET core applications. Learn how the AppDynamics platform can help you focus on application, infrastructure, and cloud insights that directly impact your business the most. Learn more about how to gain full observability of Kubernetes from Jeff Holmes, our resident Kubernetes expert. \n\nhttps://sched.co/fezT"
