description: "There often seems to be a disconnect between the cutting-edge activities of Java innovators and the trailing implementations of the  laggards  found in a more security-focused environment. How do we facilitate quicker adoption? How can we help security managers during migration? What are the related security issues and government accreditation processes? What are the common Java libraries, frameworks, and geospatial packages in these environments? This panel discussion introduces you to software developers from organizations, such as NATO and Northrop Grumman, involved in mission-critical operations. The discussion is focused on the needs of these communities, and you will see demos of related applications used in the field.\n\n\nAuthors:\nGeertjan Wielenga\nGeertjan Wielenga is a NetBeans product manager working at Oracle, focused on Java development and HTML5 development with NetBeans IDE and the NetBeans Platform.
