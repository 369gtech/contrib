description: "Sponsored by: Framer X, thanks! The easiest and most advanced design tool. Everything interactive and unlimited. Designer AND developers can use Framer. Every component can be shared (and is React). https://framer.com/\n\nLet's over-engineer our CSS animation with a physically accurate gravity simulation to get that nice acceleration and bounce. We build a simulation, and let the simulation generate the CSS animation keyframes, which we bind to the dropping SVG.\n\nSee the last episode where we very much failed in doing this. At least it was entertaining. \n▶️ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smBP4muoLYA\n\n🗿 MILESTONES\n⏯ 1:29 Recap - last time we tried to animate without transforms 😮\n⏯ 2:32 Let's over-engineer this with a physics simulation 👹\n⏯ 10:17 Taking the physics 📈 into CSS\n⏯ 15:00 Converting a Y translation simulation into a Scale transformation \n⏯ 18:20 Getting into when moving the SVG's ⊹ positioning\n\nTry out the Observable notebook yourself\n🗒 https://beta.observablehq.com/@chhib/simulating-bouncing-ball-to-generate-realistic-physics-cs\n\nBurak Kanber's physics modeling post with gravity and drag\n📉 https://burakkanber.com/blog/modeling-physics-javascript-gravity-and-drag/\n\nHenrik Joreteg's create-keyframe-animation module to generate the CSS keyframes\n📽 https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-keyframe-animation\n\nHow to transform something within an SVG using matrices\n⊹ https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20601904/svg-change-x-y-0-0-top-left-to-the-center-of-my-image\n\nDevTips is a weekly show for YOU who want to be inspired 👍 and learn 🖖 about programming.
