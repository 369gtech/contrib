description: "National Academy of Engineering\n2011 U.S. Frontiers of Engineering Symposium\nSeptember 19-21, 2011\nGoogle, Inc.\nMountain View, California\n\nOpportunities and Challenges for Multi-Scale Modeling of Sustainable Buildings\nSeptember 20, 2011 \nPresented by Dr. Jelena Srebric, Pennsylvania State University.\n\nABSTRACT: Google hosted 100 attendees of the 2011 Nat'l Academy of Engineering's U.S. Frontiers of Engineering symposium (FOE) at our Mountain View office and Dinah's Garden Hotel in Palo Alto. The symposium is an annual three-day meeting that brings together 100 of the nation's outstanding young engineers (ages 30-45) from industry, academia, and government to discuss pioneering technical and leading-edge research in various engineering fields and industry sectors.\n\nAbout the speaker: Dr. Jelena Srebric is a Professor of the Department of Architectural Engineering at Pennsylvania State University. In her talk she provides a couple of successful examples of how simulation models supported the development of sustainable building concepts and products. She also discusses several recent attempts to study community-level sustainability that outline trends for future developments of multi-scale building modeling."
