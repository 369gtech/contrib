description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nMeasuring and Optimizing Kubeflow Clusters at Lyft - Konstantin Gizdarski, Lyft & Richard Liu, Google \n\nMachine learning workloads are often resource-intensive operations. As companies adopt more of these workloads, tracking resource consumption and optimizing spending becomes more challenging.    \n\nAt Lyft, we developed a system which scrapes metrics from Kubernetes clusters and persists them in data warehouses. We then built a pipeline that transforms snapshots into cluster utilization metrics along the dimensions of CPU, memory, and GPU. Finally we join these metrics into our cost and usage dataset, so teams can budget resources accordingly and reduce spending.    In this talk, we will give an overview of Infraspend - our infrastructure for tracking Kubernetes usage. Attendees will learn how the data we collected helped Lyft reduce spending for Kubeflow clusters. The audience will also gain insights into how Kubernetes clusters can be optimized without performance or stability compromises.  \n\nhttps://sched.co/UabJ"
