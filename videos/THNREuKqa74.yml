Our team, “Safety Matters,” chose to tackle the “Millennials on the move” challenge, and try to answer the question: How can Data Save Lives on the Roads.\nIn this talk, Dafna will present a methodological way to go from simple raw data to actionable wisdom. A methodology that can be used for any data set, in any domain.\n\n\nDafna is a Senior RT Embedded Software Engineer. Loves technology and loves sharing it with others! \n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.
