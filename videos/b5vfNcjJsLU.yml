description: "RubyConf 2019 - Injecting Dependencies for Fun and Profit by Chris Hoffman\n\nDoes your codebase not seem as flexible as it used to? Are you missing that bounce in its step? Is your test suite no longer full of vigor? Get Dependency Injection! Dependency Injection soothes testing pains, improves your domain model, and makes your code more maintainable. Pay no mind to the naysayers; Dependency Injection isn’t just for architecture astronauts--it’s truly a technique for the common developer. So step right up! Discover the potential dangers of Globals, learn how to use Dependency Injection to avoid them, and see if it could be a boon to your project!\n\n#confreaks #rubyconf2019"
