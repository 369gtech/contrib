description: "Talk\nRecently I had my PhD thesis rejected. As a failure, I am uniquely positioned to recognize failure. While I am unwaveringly enthusiastic about machine learning, I aim to share my insights into failed machine learning modelling from real-world examples in science and industry. This talk is for you if you have an introductory understanding of machine learning and would like to avoid common pitfalls.\n\nSpeaker\nJesper is a recovering geophysicist with a knack for coding, machine learning, and data science. During their PhD, Jesper focused on deep learning applied to geophysical data. During this time they finished 10 peer-reviewed papers in workshops, conferences, and journals. Being ever so distractable they also reaching top 81 worldwide in the Kaggle notebooks division and worked as a consultant teaching Python and machine learning in a few places. Recently they finished a book chapter, which is under review, titled “70 Years of Machine Learning in Geoscience in Review”. They were invited to rewrite the O’Reilly teaching material for Tensorflow 2 and have just published a data science with Python video course.\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
