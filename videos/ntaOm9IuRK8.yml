description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io\n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nManaging Edge Nodes With “KubeEdge” - Yulin Sun & Li Xing, Huawei\n\nWith the fast movement in the IOT, AI industry, companies are exploring ways to push computation and intelligence to the edge.   Edge cloud computing raises a number of unique challenges such as network connectivity, network performance and compute node capacity. Current Kubernetes platform is designed for typical data center environment and might not meet the edge scenarios completely. This presentation will review the challenges along with Kubernetes limitations. It also reviews “KubeEdge” design proposal for addressing Kubernetes limitations. “KubeEdge” is an extension of Kubernetes platform for Edge Cloud environment. It supports features such as offline self-governor pod execution, low memory edge compute node, edge service access, registration and discovery (edge-to-datacenter-cloud and edge-to-edge).  The presentation will walk-through all of the above using a user case study.\n\nTo learn more click here: https://sched.co/FuLq"
