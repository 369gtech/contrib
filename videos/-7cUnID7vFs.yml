title: '"When Jargon Becomes Gibberish" - Casey Schaufler (LCA 2020)'
recordingDate: 1579223321
description: "Casey Schaufler\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/19/\n\nYou've most likely been there: you're a half hour into an important technical meeting and you realize that of the last dozen words you've heard you only recognized two, and neither would seem to have any bearing on the topic at hand. You look around and see that everyone but the presenter appears to be mentally grasping for some key understanding what's being said. Your carefully gathered notes say \"SDL PRS review SS2 Smokey Lagoon PKR BKM\". Somehow, the jargon you've relied on for precise and detailed technical communication as devolved into incomprehensible gibberish.\r\n\r\nCasey Schaufler, who's been working in operating systems development for the past 40 years, explains the reasons technical documents and presentations so often become impossible to decipher.  There's much more to it than the unguarded and unexplained use of acronyms, abbreviations and code words. The impact of language background on the use of technical terms is explored. How cultural differences between individuals and organizations can interfere with technical communications, and how that differs from general communication is discussed. What can go wrong when technical documentation is mistranslated into plain language, resulting in words with completely different meaning also gets much deserved attention. Casey will provide examples, some humorous, some maddening and some otherwise which demonstrate the problems we face. In the end, hopefully useful and pragmatic approaches for avoiding the worst gibberish production are presented.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
