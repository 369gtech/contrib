description: "Google TechTalks\nFebruary 23, 2006\n\nRuss B. Altman\n\nProf. Altman is the director of the Center for Biomedical Computation at Stanford University and is director of the biomedical informatics training program. He is also the principal investigator of a project, PharmGKB, which is an online database of genetic and phenotype information from people who have participated in research studies at various medical centers participating in the PGRN. ABSTRACT\nPharmacogenomics is the study of how variation in human genes leads to variation in drug response. One of the major promises of the genome project was to improve medical outcomes for patients by using knowledge of their genetic background. The PharmGKB..."
