description: "Charlotte Dunlap - Principal Analyst, GlobalData (previously Current Analysis)\nSerdar Yegulalp - Senior Writer, InfoWorld\nDonnie Berkholz - Research Director, 451 Research\nSean Kerner - editor, eweek/internetnews\n\nBring your questions and join a panel of top media and analysts covering containers for what is expected to be a truly informative and interesting perspective on Docker, the container ecosystem, and best (and worst) practices when talking containers. You will hear about the present and future of Docker from the perspective of those who have seen many a technology wave, and have heard from hundreds of companies building on, with, or for Docker. The session will also talk about the evolving community, the role of open source, container standards, and what we should prepare for in 2017."
