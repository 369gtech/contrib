description: "C++ is a powerful language when used by a seasoned developer. It is being used everywhere from operating systems and compilers to cross platform mobile apps development. But this power comes with a cost - C++ programming is not simple nor easy – with memory leaks, stack overflows and strange exceptions, a software developer needs all of the power he can use.\nBy harnessing the power of unit tests a software developer can find defects quickly, avoid regression and speed up development time.\n\nIn this talk I’ll show how to use the right unit testing tools and practices available that will help you get your C++ code under control and even test legacy code which no one ever want to touch.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences \nhttps://ndctechtown.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
