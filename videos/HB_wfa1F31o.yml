language: English
recordingDate: 1635778184
description: 'Frida is an open source dynamic instrumentation toolkit making it easy to observe and manipulate software across platforms and architectures. The instrumentation happens at the machine code level, so no source code is needed, and the user-defined instrumentation can be live-reloaded. In this session we''re going to explore some brand new features released in Frida 15.'
