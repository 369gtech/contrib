description: "Keeping Your DevOps Transformation from Crushing Your Ops Capacity\n\nDamon Edwards, Co-Founder, Rundeck \n\nDuring the early rise of DevOps, Operations was promised a better future with less interrupts, less conflict, and more time to focus on what matters. After all, in the popular unicorn success stories we’d hear, that was always the case. However, for many large-scale enterprises things haven’t gone as smoothly.\n\nThese enterprises have found themselves in a situation where 1-2 years into their DevOps transformation, Dev is flourishing and Ops is struggling. Operations support costs are trending higher and the operational support load, work interrupts, and context switching is getting worse. Operations is already stretched thin and there is a fear that continued DevOps acceleration could push labor capacity beyond the breaking point. \n\nSince it is not all enterprises that are suffering from this DevOps transformation caused Operations capacity crunch, what is the difference? Why are some Operations organizations flourishing and others fearing for the future? This talk will focus on the successful design patterns that the high-performing, large scale operations organizations have applied to reduce the operational burden and support costs across their entire organization. \n\nSpecifically, we’ll look at how these high-performing enterprise Operations organizations apply DevOps principles to improve the post-deployment lifecycle, their successful process and tooling design patterns, and how their Developers are playing a key role in reducing the difficulty and cost of operations activity for everyone.\n\nDOES17 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
