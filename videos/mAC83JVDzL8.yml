recordingDate: 1557110999
description: "\"Speaker: Shauna Gordon-McKeon\n\nIn July of 2018, Guido van Rossum stepped down as “Benevolent Dictator for Life” of Python.  In December, Python core developers voted on a new governance structure to guide Python going forward.  This talk explores what’s changing and how it may impact the Python community.\n\nBased on analysis of the relevant PEPs and other documentation, and strengthened via a series of interviews with core developers and other community leaders, we’ll cover Python governance past, present and future.  Particular care will be taken to explain why the core developers chose the governance model they did, what the new system entails, and how community members can participate in it.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2019 and https://github.com/PyCon/2019-slides\""
