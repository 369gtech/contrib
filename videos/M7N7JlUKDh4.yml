description: "Setting up a Kubernetes service has become relatively easy, whether on-premise or in public cloud services. However, giving secure access to developers can be a painful process involving cluster certificates, access management systems, complex identity management, networking setup, and firewalls.\n\nCluster admins want a much simpler, more automated solution that makes it easy to provide cluster access while continuing to leverage their existing RBAC to developers and their teams -- quickly, consistently, automatically, and securely, for multiple clusters, running behind different identity provider platforms and network setups.\n\nJoin us to learn how you can easily share Kubernetes clusters securely through Lens, the worldâ€™s most popular Kubernetes IDE. Lens, an open source free technology, works with any CNCF certified k8s distro. Lens empowers developers and operators to easily monitor real-time events, debug and deploy applications within their Kubernetes clusters effortlessly.\n\nIIn this demo-focused Webinar, Team Lens will showcase how to share a Kubernetes cluster securely through Lens Spaces - a cloud-based enhancement brought to Lens.\n\nIn this demo rich webinar, we will discuss how to:\n\n- Securely share a Kubernetes cluster via Lens Spaces\n\n- Access Cloud Native resource through your Catalog\n\n- Build workflows via the Hotbar"
