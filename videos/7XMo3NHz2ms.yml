title: 'Hitting the Enterprise Sweet Spot – A Real-World View of PKS Deployment and Successful Use Cases'
language: English
recordingDate: 1538633525
description: "The unfortunate reality today is that the vast majority of enterprise workloads have not derived any benefit from running in Cloud. With the default approach to cloud migrations consisting of little more than lift-and-shift (or more cynically, drop and run) only a small subset of existing apps have ever been modernized for cloud. With typical enterprise app portfolios consisting of hundreds of custom apps is it any surprise that few solutions receive a Cloud-Native makeover?\n\nThe arrival of PKS can transform the viability of enterprise application portfolios and presents a more readily acceptable cloud pathway for traditional IT shops. Based on our experience migrating hundreds of large enterprises to Cloud, we have a unique view on real-world trends and have deployed PKS in to complex multi-cloud environments.\n\nIn this session we will discover the real world use cases that drive PKS adoption, we will show where it presents a better solution for certain workloads and share real data on cloud migration trends.\n\nAt the end of this session you will know how to drive successful PKS adoption within your organisation, identify the perfect application characteristics that make a solution a great match for PKS, and also know when to select PKS over other Kubernetes-based environments.\n\nSpeakers:\nAlan Flower\nVP, Global Head – Cloud Native Labs & Advisory Services HCL CTO, HCL"
