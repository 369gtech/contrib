description: "Held on June 12 2018\n\nOracle GoldenGate and Oracle Active Data Guard allow for distribution of application workloads across replicated databases, but when applications are spread across geodistributed databases, it is a challenge to efficiently use all the databases for best performance and availability. In this AskTom Office hours session, hear from Oracle Product Development experts about how the Global Data Services feature of Oracle Database provides region-based workload routing, load balancing, and service failover across replicas while enabling a seamless distributed private data cloud for your IT. Learn how you can load-balance read/write workloads in active/active Oracle GoldenGate and load-balance read-only workloads across Oracle Active Data Guard reader farms, among numerous other use cases.\n\nAskTOM Office Hours offers free, monthly training and tips on how to make the most of Oracle Database, from Oracle product managers, developers and evangelists.\n\nhttps://asktom.oracle.com/\n\nOracle Developers portal: https://developer.oracle.com/\nSign up for an Oracle Cloud trial: https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/tryit\n\n\nmusic: bensound.com"
