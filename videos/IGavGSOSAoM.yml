description: "Google Tech Talk\nAugust 16, 2013\n(more info below)\nPresented by Ivan Janicijevic\n\nABSTRACT\n\nAre you ready to take the red pill?\n\nMobile has changed the way humans interact with computers. This is great, but as engineers we're faced with an ever growing matrix of environments our code runs on. The days of considering only a handful of browsers and screen resolutions are not coming back. How can engineers cope with the Matrix? We'll cover how Google is fighting this testing problem on workstations, in the cloud and in your head...\n\n\"I'm trying to free your mind, Neo. But I can only show you the door. You're the one that has to walk through it.\"\n\nAbout the speaker:\nIvan Janicijevic is a Senior Software Engineer in test and is passionate about building android development and test infrastructure. Having joined Google in 2006, Ivan worked on the Google Checkout team, developing automation infrastructure. He then helped the Google Wallet Android engineering team by building internal development infrastructure, build / release systems, and moved them from zero automated test coverage to having hundreds of tests verifying every code submission. Then, Ivan worked on making state-of-the-art development, test, and release infrastructure available to all Android application developers at Google. Today, Ivan is working on mobile infrastructure for ads projects in NYC."
