title: 'YOW! 2013 Jim Webber - A Little Graph Theory for the Busy Developer'
recordingDate: 1513952426
description: "In this talk weâ€™ll explore powerful analytic techniques for graph data. Firstly weâ€™ll discover some of the innate properties of (social) graphs from fields like anthropology and sociology. By understanding the forces and tensions within the graph structure and applying some graph theory, weâ€™ll be able to predict how the graph will evolve over time. To test just how powerful and accurate graph theory is, weâ€™ll also be able to (retrospectively) predict World War 1 based on a social graph and a few simple mechanical rules.Then weâ€™ll see how graph matching can be used to extract online business intelligence (for powerful retail recommendations). In turn weâ€™ll apply these powerful techniques to modelling domains in Neo4j (a graph database) and show how Neo4j can be used to drive business intelligence. Donâ€™t worry, there wonâ€™t be much maths ðŸ™‚\n\nDr. Jim Webber is Chief Scientist with Neo Technology the company behind the popular open source graph database Neo4j, where he where he works on R&D for highly scalable graph databases and writes open source software. Jim has written two books on integration (Developing Enterprise Web Services â€“ An Architectâ€™s Guide) and distributed systems (REST in Practice) and his latest book is Graph Databases which focusses on the Neo4j database. His blog is located at http://jimwebber.org and he tweets often @jimwebber.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
