title: '#HITB2021AMS D1T2 - Attacking Fast Charging Electric Vehicles - Wu HuiYu and YuXiang Li'
language: English
recordingDate: 1623117805
description: "Electric vehicles represented by Tesla are changing the way people travel. How to safely and quickly charge electric vehicles is a problem that manufacturers of electric vehicles and charging piles need to solve. We conducted an in-depth analysis of the security of the DC fast charging communication protocol, and found many interesting findings.\n\nThis talk is mainly divided into three parts. First, we will introduce the current global mainstream fast charging standards and communication protocols; Then, we will share how to build a X-in-the-Middle attack environment.\n\nWe have written a security test tool called “XCharger”, and it can be used to capture, modification, replay, and fuzzing the data packets in the communication process. We will share how to use our tool to analyze the private charging pile agreement of a well-known electric vehicle manufacturer, and to exploit the protocol vulnerability of DC fast charging pile to achieve free charging, and to change the charging voltage and current limits.\n\n=== \n\nWu HuiYu is a senior security researcher of Tencent Blade Team. Now his job is mainly focusing on AIoT security research. He is also a bug hunter, winner of GeekPwn 2015 & 2020, and speaker of BlackHat USA, DEFCON, HITB and POC.\n\n--- \n\nYuxiang Li is a senior security researcher at the Tencent Blade Team, specialized in the study of mobile security, IoT security, and browser security. He has reported multiple vulnerabilities in Android and Chrome and has received acknowledgments from many companies such as Google. He was a speaker of BlackHat USA / DEF CON / HITB AMS."
