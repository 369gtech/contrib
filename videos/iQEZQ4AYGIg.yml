description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2019 by Brian Plummer, friendlyrobot.nyc.\n\nMore info: http://androidmakers.fr/schedule/?sessionId=TGV-6847\n\nIs your team not reviewing code? You should be! Does it feel like you could be getting more out of code reviews? Absolutely! Code reviews are severely underutilized.  Let me show you some approaches to get more value from code reviews for you and your team.  \n\nI will emphasize code review best practices starting with why you should be performing code reviews.  Some teams don't perform reviews and this is really hurting them in the long run. I will attempt to sell the review process and explain why it is fundamental to our roles as developers.  \n\nTeams that are performing reviews may feel burdened by doing so and see it as chore. This also is not ideal and I will dig a little deeper and discuss why we feel this way sometimes. What are the strategies to overcome this feeling? Is it possible to enjoy code review?\n\nAre there shortcuts to work more efficiently at reviewing code? Absolutely! Can some things be automated? What can't? Let me show you some great approaches to making the review process streamlined and efficient.\n\nAlex Karp Production"
