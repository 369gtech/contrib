description: "DNA is one of the most efficient forms of data storage we know of. As our capacity to produce and capture data continues to grow, DNA offers a way for us to handle our storage needs. This talk aims to introduce attendees to the algorithms being developed to read and write data efficiently to DNA, innovations around how researchers are reducing costs and increasing speed of DNA production, and the potential of DNA to help us manage our data storage needs.\n\nRuthie Nachmany"
