description: "Slides - https://speakerdeck.com/chie8842/distributed-processing-in-python\n\nThere are several ways and libraries for distributed processing using Python. Each of these is developed under different concepts and has different features. we need to understand these features for efficient usage of computer resources. In this session, I will discuss how to be good to choose and use these distributed processing tools.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
