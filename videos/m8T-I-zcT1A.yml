description: "The virtual DOM was a fantastic innovation. It brought about a much more productive way of writing web applications by allowing us to write our views in a declarative manner.\n\nThis big benefit has little to do with performance of the initial render. Instead, it is the process of updating the DOM to reflect changes in your state has become much faster.\n\nThis process of bringing the DOM in sync with the state is often referred to as DOM reconciliation.\n\nEVENT:\n\nØredev 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nSindre Osen Aarsaether\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nØredev Conference Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video."
