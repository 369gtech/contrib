description: "Companies are beginning to understand that great design incites an emotional connection. This doesn’t occur at the enterprise level, but in the hearts of each individual user. Changing a 100+ year old company to be design-led isn’t a walk in the park.\n\nIBM Design Thinking was developed to unite IBM and deliver solutions that delight their users individually, and deliver increasing value for every additional IBM touchpoint they experience.\n\nHear how Adam has brought design thinking to the enterprise at a scale never attempted before. He’ll share how IBM Design Thinking works and how it has been changing the way that IBM works from the inside out and the outside in.\n\nAdam Cutler\nDesign Studio Practices Director, IBM Design\nhttps://twitter.com/adam_cutler\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
