description: "Further information: https://berlinbuzzwords.de/17/session/containerizing-distributed-pipes\n\nIn this talk I will present how we enable distributed, Unix style programming using Docker and Apache Kafka. We will show how we can take the famous Unix Pipe Pattern and apply it to a Distributed Computing System. We will demonstrate the development of simple applications with the focus on \"\"Do One Thing and Do It Well.\"\" Afterwards we demonstrate how we make these two programs work to together using Apache Kafka. By encapsulating our applications in containers we will also show how that enables us to go from the limited resources of a development machine to cluster of computers in a data center without changing our applications or containers.\n\nSpeaker:\nHagen TÃ¶nnies"
