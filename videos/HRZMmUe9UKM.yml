recordingDate: 1612094216
description: "Ingrid Mason, DR JASON ENSOR, Liz Stokes\n\nhttps://lca2021.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/91/\n\nIn 2020 a regional chapter of AI4LAM (AI for Libraries, Archives and Museums) [1] was launched for Australia and New Zealand.  This is a grassroots initiative coordinated by volunteers to draw together people passionate about digital cultural heritage collections and digital humanities research with interests in data, technology and computation and many questions about where/when/what/how/why AI is going to or can be a part of work practice.  \r\n\r\nNew practices e.g., automation, analytics, or augmentation, need different technical expertise, disciplinary knowledge and cultural experience to be brought together.  A little spark of magic flares when creative and technical minds and gentle hearts come together to ask questions, solve problems and reflect together.   \r\n\r\nThe welcome mat is out and the open source community in Australia and New Zealand are invited to join in, share expertise and learn, and work on projects.  Come to this talk to find out what's happening and why you might like to join us.                 \r\n\r\n[1] https://sites.google.com/view/ai4lam/home\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
