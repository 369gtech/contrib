description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2018\n—\nDo you want to make a lot of money? You'll see some examples of free browser and server based WebSocket programs which have earned their respective individual authors tens of millions of dollars in no time at all. Perhaps after seeing this talk in person, you'll write the next massively successful WebSocket app!\n\nThe WebSocket protocol powers the interactive web by enabling two-way messaging between the browser and the web server. The Boost.Beast library implements this protocol on top of the industry standard Boost.Asio library which models the Networking Technical Specification proposed for the ISO C++ Standard.\n\nThis presentation introduces Networking TS concepts and algorithms, how to read their requirements, and how to use them in your programs. We will build from scratch a multi-user chat server in C++11 using Beast, and the corresponding browser-based chat client in HTML and JavaScript.  No prior knowledge or understanding of Beast or Asio is required, the talk is suited for everyone.\n\nAccess the source code and slides for this talk at https://github.com/vinniefalco/CppCon2018\n— \nVinnie Falco\nPresident, The C++ Alliance\nI'm the author of BearShare, DSPFilters, and most importantly Boost.Beast - a C++ header only library that offers implementations for HTTP and WebSockets, located here: https://github.com/boostorg/beast/\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
