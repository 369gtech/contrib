description: "Benchmarking Cloud Native Storage - Josh Berkus, Red Hat \n\nYou can run your stateful apps on Kubernetes. You can even run your databases on Kubernetes. But what are you giving up in performance? Is it worth it, or should you stick to the hosting you know? For the past several months, we've been benchmarking various forms of Kubernetes storage, including host storage, network storage, cloud storage and cloud-native storage systems like Rook. Let us share with you the results of running PostgreSQL, CockroachDB and filesystem benchmarks so that you can make the best possible tradeoffs. We'll even show you how to do your own, to test your own platform. You will leave this talk with a much better idea of the quantitative tradeoffs between performance, reliability, data retention, and manageability. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPcq"
