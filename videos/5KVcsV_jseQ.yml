description: "RubyConf 2018 - Graphics and Simulations (and Games), Oh My! by Ryan Davis\n\nQuick and easy visualization is an important teaching tool and a wonderful way to see your ideas in action. Unfortunately, it is neither quick nor easy for rubyists to get from idea to visualization. You have to have a ton of extra stuff installed. You need to know game mechanics/math. You need to learn a whole other way of programming. It isn't something that is easy for a beginning programmer to pick up. This talk describes an alternative graphics and simulation library with a very clean API making it incredibly easy for newbs and experimenters to go from idea to visual simulation. Pew pew pew!"
