description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTOpia February 2021. #GOTOcon #GOTOpia\nhttp://gotopia.eu\n\nDaniel Bryant - Director of Developer Relations at Ambassador Labs\n\nORIGINAL TALK TITLE\nCloud Native Development Without the Toil: An Overview of Practices and Tooling\n\nABSTRACT\nAt GOTO Amsterdam in 2019 I presented how to create an effective cloud native developer workflow (https://youtu.be/V-oc2GH7iZs). Two years later and many new developer technologies have come and gone, but I still hear daily from cloud developers about the pain and friction associated with building, debugging, and deploying to the cloud.\nIn this talk I'll share my latest learning on how to bring the fun and productivity back into delivering Kubernetes-based software.\n\nJoin this talk to:\n• Learn why the core tenets of continuous delivery -- speed and safety -- must be considered in all parts of the cloud native SDLC\n• Explore how cloud native coding benefits from thinking separately about the inner development loop, continuous integration, continuous deployment, observability, and analysis\n• Understand how cloud native best practices and tooling fit together. • Learn about artifact syncing (e.g. Skaffold), dev environment bridging (e.g. Telepresence), GitOps (e.g. Argo), and observability-focused monitoring (e.g. Prometheus, Jaeger)\n• Explore the importance of cultivating an effective cloud platform and associated team of experts\n• Walk away with an overview of tools that can help you develop and debug effectively [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n00:26 tl;dr\n02:30 Why we're all here: Happy users\n03:09 Continuous delivery of value\n04:34 2 modern software trends for speed & safety\n04:43 Trend 1: Microservices\n05:40 Trend 2: Kubernetes\n07:33 The Kubernetes migration journey(s)\n10:52 Safety requires multiple strategies\n11:53 Safety requires the cloud\n13:26 Safety needs to be part of your workflow\n18:44 Patterns, practices & tooling\n18:53 Pattern: Artifact syncing\n20:25 Skaffold: \"Source to k8s\" CLI tool\n21:57 Pattern: Dev environment bridging/extension\n22:41 Telepresence: Local-to-remote bridge\n24:41 Pattern: GitOps\n26:48 Argo CD: GitOps for k8s\n28:10 GitOps in a nutshell\n28:54 Argo rollouts: k8s progressive delivery controller\n30:49 Putting it all together: Safety & speed\n32:23 What about the platform & the people?\n32:28 Workflow: Full cycle development\n33:37 Conclusion\n34:26 Outro\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotopia.eu/february-2021/sessions/1685/cloud-native-development-without-the-toil-an-overview-of-practices-and-tooling\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#CloudNative #Cloud #Kubernetes #k8s #DevOps #ContinuousDelivery #CD #Testing #GitOps #Microservices #Safety #Speed #Skaffold\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
