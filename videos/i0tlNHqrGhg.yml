title: 'Hands-On Lab using Oracle Machine Learning Services on Autonomous Database'
language: English
recordingDate: 1621616149
description: "In this Hands on Lab users experienced the use of Oracle Machine Learning Services on Oracle Autonomous Database through several Labs.\n\nOML Services extends OML functionality to support model deployment and model lifecycle management for both in-database OML models and third-party Open Neural Networks Exchange (ONNX) machine learning models via REST APIs.  \n\nThe REST API for Oracle Machine Learning Services provides REST API endpoints hosted on Oracle Autonomous Database. These endpoints enable the storage of machine learning models along with its metadata, and the creation of scoring endpoints for the model.  \n\nThese third-party classification or regression models can be built using tools that support the ONNX format, which includes packages like Scikit-learn and TensorFlow, among several others.\n\nIn addition, OML Services supports proprietary cognitive text capabilities, with capabilities for topic discovery, keywords, summary, sentiment, and feature extraction. The initial languages supported include English, Spanish, and French (based on a Wikipedia knowledgebase using embeddings).\n\nOML Services cognitive image functionality, supported through the ONNX format third-party model deployment feature, supports scoring using images or tensors.\n\n02:18 Agenda\n02:58 Accessing the Live Labs\n06:39 Introduction to Oracle Machine Learning Services\n10:03 Labs Overview\n10:58 Lab 1: Installation and configuration Postman for REST API\n13:42 Launch Postman\n14:26 Download and Import sample Postman collections for OML Services\n17:08 Checking readiness of environments\n18:23 Launching OML Workshop\n20:08 Configure Postman environment for the Live Labs OML Service server\n23:18 Lab 2: Getting the Token for Authorization of OML Services REST requests \n31:32 Lab 3: Registering and Scoring with Oracle Machine Learning models\n31:43 Lab 3.3 Store OML model\n33:08 Lab 3.3 Download ZIP file and load sample model into Postman\n37:13 Lab 3.8 Create REST endpoint for OML model\n40:04 Lab 3.13 Scoring OML model (single and mini-batch)\n44:34 Lab 3.18 Scoring OML model (with Prediction Details)\n45:58 OML models resiliency to input data errors\n47:56 Lab3: Bonus round: Registering a model to OML Services from OML AutoML UI\n53:43 Creating an OML AutoML UI experiment\n57:04 Registering the OML AutoML UI model into OML Services as REST endpoints\n1:00:18 Lab 3.11 List all models now showing the model registered from OML AutoML UI\n1:00:50 Lab 3.13 Scoring the model built with AutoML UI\n1:01:30 Lab 4: Registering and Scoring with ML models in ONNX format\n1:01:39 Lab 4.3 Store ONNX model\n1:03:31 Lab 4.8 Create REST endpoint for ONNX ML model \n1:03:51 Lab 4.13 Score ONNX ML model (single and mini-batch)\n1:05:59 Lab 5: Registering and Scoring with Image Classification models in ONNX format\n1:06:10 Lab 5.3 Store ONNX Image model\n1:07:20 Lab 5.8 Create REST endpoint for ONNX Image model \n1:07:58 Lab 5.13 Score ONNX Image model (single image and topN option)\n1:11:09 Lab 6: Using OML Services Cognitive Text REST APIs\n1:11:54 Lab 6.2 Cognitive text - English\n1:15:49 Lab 6.8 Cognitive Text - Spanish\n1:16:03 Lab 6.15 Cognitive text - French\n1:17:09 Where to go from here?\n1:18:15 Q&A"
