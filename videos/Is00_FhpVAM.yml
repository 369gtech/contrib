description: "The Web has a superpower—it's a frictionless and federated experience, whether for search results, news articles, ride sharing, or spreadsheets. With modern, evergreen browsers, your users can accept site prompts to install web experiences to their device's home screen or desktop.\n\nThis talk is for designers of enterprise & consumer web apps who want to understand the options for installed web experiences from browsers and the Play Store. We’ll cover when, where & how to promote web install—and, once installed, best practices for UX & measuring success in installed web apps.\n\nEVENT:\n\nChrome Dev Summit 2019\n\nSPEAKERS:\n\nPJ McLachlan, Sam Thorogood, Mukund Laddha\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nATTRIBUTION CREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hp_dQvQyYEI"
