description: "Sebastian Daschner, Developer, Sebastian Daschner - IT-Beratung\n\nMost of today’s enterprise applications are based on a CRUD data model that is simple and straightforward to implement. Another concept of how to model applications is command-query responsibility segregation (CQRS), which enables interesting solutions and use cases, especially with the rising demands of scalability. This session covers the concept and benefits of CQRS; which other buzzwords—such as eventual consistency, event-driven architectures, and event sourcing—it is related to; and how to realize a CQRS application. It also answers questions about whether this concept can be realized with Java EE technology. Most of the time is devoted to examining the “devil is in the details” aspects of both approaches."
