title: 'James M  Snell - Adding streams to Node.js...again | August 2021'
language: Spanish
recordingDate: 1632783424
description: 'One of the single most popular feature requests for the Node.js platform is the implementation of the standardized Fetch API, and while that API itself looks simple on the surface, the underlying implementation is much more complicated. Within the project we''ve been working on all of the necessary bits including an implementation of the WHATWG Streams API. Here I''ll be talking about the long road to having Web streams within Node.js, how they work, how they were implemented, and what they''re going to be used for.'
