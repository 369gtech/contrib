description: 'Once in a generation, a book comes along that transforms the business landscape. Company strategy typically has been planned by corporate chiefs in annual meetings, and then dictated to managers to carry out. In The New How, Nilofer Merchant shows corporate directors, executives, and managers that the best way to create a winning strategy is to include employees at all levels, helping to create strategy they not only believe in, but are also equipped to implement.'
