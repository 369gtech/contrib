description: "Change might be easy once and difficult another time. Change is smooth in certain areas of life, but seems to be impossible in others. It can be long-lasting, or short-lived, when everything goes back to the usual track, no matter how hard we try.\n\nWhat explains all these differences? Where are the hidden elements of our change processes which, when revealed, could help us to go through the changes we desire - the way we desire? Using the unique ORGANOCO change support method, this session opens some new doors. You will learn here surprising and useful perspectives on how changes work in the human systems, on personal and team-levels too.\n- Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/stretch\n\nStretch Leadership and Management Conference\nstretchcon.com"
