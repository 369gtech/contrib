title: 'Database In-Memory Pushing Down into Scans'
language: English
recordingDate: 1604355662
description: 'AskTOM Office Hours offers free, open Q&A sessions with Oracle Database experts. This session will explore how Database In-Memory is able to perform function-based aggregations, filter predicates and single table group bys during the scan of the data. This is very different from the way the row store works and is another example of how Database In-Memory achieves orders of magnitude performance gains for analytic queries. Join Andy Rivenes (@TheInMemoryGuy) and Database In-Memory developer Allison Holloway for some examples and discussion of how this works and how to tell if you''re getting benefits.'
