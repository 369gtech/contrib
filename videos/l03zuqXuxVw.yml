description: "RubyConf 2018 - It's Down! Simulating Incidents in Production by Kelsey Pederson\n\nWho loves getting paged at 3am? No one.\n\nIn responding to incidents -- either at 3am or the middle of the day -- we want to feel prepared and practiced in resolving production issues. In this talk, you'll learn how to practice incident response by simulating outages in production. We'll draw from learnings from our simulations at Stitch Fix, like technical implementation strategies, key metrics to watch, and writing runbooks. You'll walk away from this talk with the superhero ability help your team simulate incidents in production.\n\nBe prepared for your next incident!"
