Adding new capabilities requires more and more processing power. When it gets impossible to keep everything on just ten servers, we have to scale the cluster to a hundred. When a hundred gets too tight, we expand it to 1,000. What’s next? 10,000? And how is it possible, considering current scalability limits of a single Erlang cluster?\n\nThis talk will guide you along the way we took to improve Erlang scalability, remove bottlenecks and increase efficiency of our Erlang-based applications.\n\nRead the full abstract: http://codesync.global/speaker/maxim-fedorov/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - MAXIM FEDOROV\nSoftware Engineer at WhatsApp\n\nMaxim Fedorov is a software engineer at WhatsApp, the largest messaging app. Maxim’s work is focused on performance and scalability of the server side.\n\nBefore WhatsApp, Maxim has been developing low-latency TCP/IP applications at NetAlliance (Sydney, Australia), designing Kaspersky Enterprise Security Endpoint (Moscow, Russia), improving Parallels Virtual Automation, called Odin now, at Parallels (former SWsoft), and developing network security software before.\n\nMaxim earned a Master’s Degree in Computer Science.\n\nMore on Maxim Fedorov: http://codesync.global/speaker/maxim-fedorov/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE MESH LDN 18\nCode Mesh LDN is powered by Code Sync. Code Mesh LDN 18 was sponsored by WhatsApp, Toyota Connected, Erlang Solutions, TEAMango, and aeternity. \n\nCODE SYNC \nWebsite: www.codesync.global\nTwitter: www.twitter.com/CodeMeshIO\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/CodeSyncGlobal\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/code-sync/\nMail: info at codesync.global\n\n#Scalability #WhatsApp #Erlang #Cluster #CodeMesh"
