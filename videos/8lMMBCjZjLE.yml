recordingDate: 1563355739
description: "This talk was recorded at CukenFest London 2019. For more information, visit our website - http://cukenfest.cucumber.io\n\nSascha has been working for more than 2 years in a project with microservices and Cucumber. Sascha explains what microservices are and outlines the benefits and the downsides of them more broadly. Before wrapping up with a look at the impact of using microservices on testing, especially when using cucumber.\n \nSascha will demonstrate how you can continuously test and release your services isolated from each other and how to make sure, that all these independent services are still working together."
