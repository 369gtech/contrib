description: "Recording brought to you by American Express. https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs\nAs Android developers, often we work with a backend service. Often in our team there is an iOS project or a #JavaScript project, with similar functionality, that is being developed by our teammate developers next door. How fun would it be to write Kotlin code once and share it with all platforms? It will save us so much time and effort of implementation and testing! Please meet Kotlin Multiplatform! It is experimental, and yet very powerful and awesome.\n\nThis session will focus on creating a full-stack Kotlin project that fits Android app and a backend Kotlin component. You’ll learn how to share code between the components to build more efficient and robust applications. And your teammate next door will thank you as well.\n\nResources:\nKotlinConf website: https://jb.gg/fyaze5\nKotlinConf on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlinconf\n\nKotlin website: https://jb.gg/pxrsn6\nKotlin blog: https://jb.gg/7uc7ow\nKotlin on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlin\n\n#KotlinConf19 #Kotlin #JetBrains\n\nAbout the Presenter:\nBritt is a Developer Advocate at Nexmo, mainly focusing on the Android technology and communities.
