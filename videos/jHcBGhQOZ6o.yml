recordingDate: 1541257469
description: 'With Kubernetes becoming the de facto (vs. OpenShift, EKS, PKS, GCE, etc.) abstraction for cloud providers, we need to get ready and step up our game to make sure that we are designing with these environments in mind. This presentation will cover the challenges, lessons learned and conclusions from a Java Open Source project while adopting these technologies. This session is not an introduction to Kubernetes, quite the opposite, it will highlight why Kubernetes is great, but not a magic silver bullet that will solve all your problems. You need to be ready to make some hard choices and learn fast.'
