title: 'Rob Ashton - End-to-end Purescript with Erlang/OTP'
language: English
recordingDate: 1580211001
description: 'Purescript is a great sensibly-typed language which has been created for front-end development work with JavaScript.  It also now has a compiler back-end to Erlang, which means we can start to write applications that are Purescript all the way down.  In this session we will show you how any of this works, demonstrating some of the open source libraries we have released to make working with OTP easier, how we can share the code and models between the front-end and the back-end and how this benefits us when building systems that we can trust to be safe with the compiler with the safety net of OTP at run-time.'
