description: "From Colossus, ENIAC and valve memory to quantum cryptography, biological algorithms and the singularity, there’s one thing that never changes. Methodologies and languages may come and go, but “best practice” has always been a guarantee of quality. Great systems that work first time, delivered on time, every time - and all thanks to the engineering miracle of “best practice”.\nJoin Mark Rendle and Dylan Beattie as we take you on a journey through the amazing history - and future - of software engineering. We’ll be showing off the best ideas, patterns and techniques from a century of best practice and software excellence.\n\nAfter all, trends may come and go, but truly great engineering never goes out of fashion."
