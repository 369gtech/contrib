description: "PyData Berlin 2018\n\nWith nonlinear models it is difficult to find a balance between predictive power and interpretability. How does feature A affect the output y? How will the model extrapolate? Generalized Additive Models are flexible and interpretable, with great implementations in R, but few options in the Python universe. pyGAM is a new open source library that offers to fill this gap.\n\nSlides: https://github.com/dswah/PyData-Berlin-2018-pyGAM/blob/master/PyData_pyGAM_slides.pdf\n---\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
