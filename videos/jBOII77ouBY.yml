recordingDate: 1508669553
description: "https://media.ccc.de/c/asg2017/ASG2017-109-kube-spawn_testing_multi-node_kubernetes_clusters_on_linux_systems\n\n\n\nkube-spawn is a tool to easily start a local, multi-node Kubernetes cluster on a Linux machine. While it was originally meant to be used mainly by developers of Kubernetes, it has been turned into a tool that is great for just trying Kubernetes out. In this talk, I will give a general introduction to kube-spawn and cover integration issues.\n\n\n\nDongsu Park"
