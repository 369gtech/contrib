description: "At if(we), we’re committed to improving all aspects of our tech stack. This includes our client-side JavaScript, which consists of hundreds of thousands of lines of code across thousands of files.\n\nAs JavaScript projects grow, they tend to become difficult to manage if you’re not careful. We found ourselves running into common problems including code that was difficult to reuse or test, and code that broke when introduced in new pages.\n\nAs we explored the problems in more detail, we found the root cause was most often due to ineffective dependency management. For example, script A relies on script B that relies on script C, and somehow the dependency chain would break on some pages because script C didn’t get included properly.\n\nTo help solve this problem, we identified five traits of well-managed JavaScript to help guide us as we built new features and libraries.\n\nThis Ignite talk will walk through the five traits, including examples of the types of problems they help avoid."
