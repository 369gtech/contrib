description: "Let's discuss the math behind back-propagation. We'll go over the 3 terms from Calculus you need to understand it (derivatives, partial derivatives, and the chain rule and implement it programmatically.\n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/how_to_do_math_for_deep_learning\n\nPlease Subscribe! And like. And comment. That's what keeps me going.\n\nI've used this code in a previous video. I had to keep the code as simple as possible in order to add on these mathematical explanations and keep it at around 5 minutes.\n\nMore Learning resources:\nhttps://mihaiv.wordpress.com/2010/02/08/backpropagation-algorithm/\nhttp://outlace.com/Computational-Graph/\nhttp://briandolhansky.com/blog/2013/9/27/artificial-neural-networks-backpropagation-part-4\nhttps://jeremykun.com/2012/12/09/neural-networks-and-backpropagation/\nhttps://mattmazur.com/2015/03/17/a-step-by-step-backpropagation-example/\n\nJoin us in the Wizards Slack channel:\nhttp://wizards.herokuapp.com/\n\nAnd please support me on Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/user?u=3191693\n\nForgot to add my patron shoutout at the end so special thanks to Patrons Tim Jiang, HG Oh, Hoang, Advait Shinde, Vijay Daniel & Umesh Rangasamy\nFollow me:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/sirajraval\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/sirajology Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/sirajraval/ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/sirajraval/"
