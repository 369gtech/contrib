description: "In this webcast, Dani Nordin, author of the Drupal for Designers series, will walk you through the process of working with clients through the Drupal design process. You will learn:\n\n    What to say (and not to) when discussing Drupal with clients;\n    What information you need to put together a strong proposal;\n    Strategies for leading clients through the Drupal design and implementation process.\n\nAbout Dani Nordin:\n\nDani Nordin is an independent user experience designer and strategist who specializes in smart, human-friendly design for progressive brands. She discovered design purely by accident as a Theatre student at Rhode Island College in 1995, and has been doing some combination of design, public speaking and writing ever since.\n\nDani is a regular feature at Boston's Drupal meetup, and is a regular speaker at Boston's Design for Drupal Camp. In 2011, she was one of several contributors to The Definitive Guide to Drupal 7, published by Apress; Drupal for Designers is her second book. You can check out some of her work at tzk-design.com. She also blogs almost regularly at daninordin.com. Dani lives in Watertown, MA with her husband Nick and Persephone, a 14-pound giant ball of black furry love cat. Both are infinite sources of comedic gold."
