description: "In this talk, I’ll talk about GraphQL, a data query language created by Facebook as an alternative to the widely used REST. I’ll list the key differences between the twos and pros and cons of GraphQL over a “traditional” REST API. \n\nI’ll tell why GraphQL has been created, what problems does it solve and how to create GraphQL APIs with Python with an additional follow up on how to use it with Django, one of the most popular web framework. If we have enough time I’ll touch on advanced topics like authentication, caching, security and real-time. \n\nTakeaway: the objective of the talk is to have an introduction on GraphQL, understand why and when to use it and, finally, how to use it Python.\n\nEVENT:\n\nDjangoCon Europe 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nPatrick Arminio\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ix_DSdxgoK0"
