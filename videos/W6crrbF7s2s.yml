title: 'Clojure spec Screencast: Testing'
language: English
recordingDate: 1469634654
description: "Clojure spec defines specifications for both data and functions. In addition to validity checking, specs can generate random samples of the data they specify. This capability enables an alternative to unit testing known as generative, or property-based, testing.\n\nThe \"check\" function automatically generates a large number of example inputs to a function and checks that the invocation of the function satisfies its specification. A complementary function \"instrument\" verifies that calls to a function satisfy the function's specification. In this screencast, Stuart Halloway demonstrates how to use both \"check\" and \"instrument\" to automatically leverage specs to better test your code."
