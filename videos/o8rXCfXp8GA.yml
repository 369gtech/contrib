description: "Like the Winter in some famous TV show, CDI 2.0 has been Coming for nearly 2 years. But now CDI 2.0 is Here (like the same Winter) and all the new stuff it brings will deeply change your Java EE, MicroProfile and Java SE experience. In this session I will review the major features introduced in CDI 2.0 and I'll demonstrate how it can be used in various environment like Java EE 7 application server, MicroProfile platform or even Java SE. If you still think that CDI is a simple Dependency Injection solution bound to Java EE or think that there's only one platform to bootstrap advanced service on Java SE, come and see that the CDI \"Winter\" can compete with \"Spring\".\n\nAntoine Sabot-Durand is an IT consultant since 1996, Java developer since 2000 and Senior software Engineer at Red Hat since 2013, Antoine is CDI spec lead and in charge of CDI eco-system development and advocacy. He's also tech lead on Agorava, a CDI framework helping social media consuming. Before that he worked as consultant and architect for a lot of customer in Bank, Insurance, public transport or Automotive. Antoine often fly from his paris home to meet the community by speaking at Devoxx, Java One, or various Jugs. Heâ€™s also known to be a serial twitter on this topics. You can follow him on @antoine_sd. When not writing specification, coding, twitting or giving talk, Antoine likes spending time with his wife and 3 children.\n\n[LUB-6226]"
