title: 'On Laplacian Eigenmaps for Dimensionality Reduction - Juan Orduz'
language: English
recordingDate: 1533145452
description: "PyData Berlin 2018 \n\nThe aim of this talk is to describe the non-linear dimensionality reduction algorithm based on spectral techniques introduced in \\cite{BN2003}. This approach has its foundation on the spectral analysis of graph Laplacian. The motivation of the construction comes from the role of the continuous limit, the Laplace-Beltrami operator, in providing an optimal embedding for manifolds.\n\nSlides: https://juanitorduz.github.io/documents/orduz_pydata2018.pdf\n---\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
