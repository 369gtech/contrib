description: "🔥 Deep Learning Training - TensorFlow Certification https://www.edureka.co/ai-deep-learning-with-tensorflow\nThis Edureka video on \"COVID Detection Using Deep Learning \" will provide you with a comprehensive and detailed knowledge of Image classification and how it can be implemented using a Convolutional Neural Network. In this video, you will be working on image processing with Python and also will learn about the convolutional neural network. Finally, we will build an end-to-end model to process and identify the Covid X-Ray images with CNN.\nThese are the following topics that are covered in this video:\n00:00:00 Introduction\n00:00:47 Why CNN?\n00:04:55 What is CNN?\n00:07:00 Image Processing Using CNN\n00:11:00 CNN For Covid Detection \n\n🔹Check our complete Deep Learning With TensorFlow playlist here: https://goo.gl/cck4hE \n🔹Check our complete Deep Learning With TensorFlow Blog Series: http://bit.ly/2sqmP4s \n\n🔴Please do subscribe to our channel and hit the bell icon to never miss an update from us in the future: https://goo.gl/6ohpTV\n\n---------Edureka Online Training and Certification-----------\n\n🔵 Data Science Online Training: https://bit.ly/2NCT239\n🟣 Python Online Training: https://bit.ly/2CQYGN7\n🔵 AWS Online Training: https://bit.ly/2ZnbW3s\n🟣 RPA Online Training: https://bit.ly/2Zd0ac0\n🔵 DevOps Online Training: https://bit.ly/2BPwXf0\n🟣 Big Data Online Training: https://bit.ly/3g8zksu\n🔵 Java Online Training: https://bit.ly/31rxJcY\n\n-----------Edureka Masters Programs-----------\n\n🟣Machine Learning Engineer Masters Program: https://bit.ly/388NXJi\n🔵DevOps Engineer Masters Program: https://bit.ly/2B9tZCp\n🟣Cloud Architect Masters Program:  https://bit.ly/3i9z0eJ\n🔵Data Scientist Masters Program:  https://bit.ly/2YHaolS\n🟣Big Data Architect Masters Program:  https://bit.ly/31qrOVv\n🔵Business Intelligence Masters Program: https://bit.ly/2BPLtn2\n\n--------------Edureka PGP Courses---------------\n\n🔵Artificial and Machine Learning PGP: https://bit.ly/2Ziy7b1\n🟣CyberSecurity PGP: https://bit.ly/3eHvI0h\n🔵Digital Marketing PGP: https://bit.ly/38cqdnz\n🟣Big Data Engineering PGP: https://bit.ly/3eTSyBC\n🔵Data Science PGP: https://bit.ly/3dIeYV9\n🟣Cloud Computing PGP: https://bit.ly/2B9tHLP\n-------\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/edurekain\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/edureka\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/edureka_learning/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/edurekaIN/   \nSlideShare: https://www.slideshare.net/EdurekaIN   \nCastbox: https://castbox.fm/networks/505?country=in\nMeetup:  https://www.meetup.com/edureka/\n\n#Edureka  #EdurekaDeepLearning #COVID19Detection #PneumoniaPrediction  #DeepLearningTutorial  #EdurekaTraining #Python\n\n----------------------------\n\nHow it Works?\n1. This is a 5 Week Instructor led Online Course,40 hours of assignment and 20 hours of project work\n2. We have a 24x7 One-on-One LIVE Technical Support to help you with any problems you might face or any clarifications you may require during the course.\n3. At the end of the training you will be working on a real time project for which we will provide you a Grade and a Verifiable Certificate!\n\nAbout the Course :\nEdureka's Deep learning with Tensorflow course will help you to learn the basic concepts of TensorFlow, the main functions, operations and the execution pipeline. Starting with a simple “Hello Word” example, throughout the course you will be able to see how TensorFlow can be used in curve fitting, regression, classification and minimization of error functions. This concept is then explored in the Deep Learning world. You will evaluate the common, and not so common, deep neural networks and see how these can be exploited in the real world with complex raw data using TensorFlow. In addition, you will learn how to apply TensorFlow for backpropagation to tune the weights and biases while the Neural Networks are being trained. Finally, the course covers different types of Deep Architectures, such as Convolutional Networks, Recurrent Networks and Autoencoders.  Delve into neural networks, implement Deep Learning algorithms, and explore layers of data abstraction with the help of this Deep Learning with TensorFlow course.  \n\nWhy Learn Deep Learning With TensorFlow?\nTensorFlow is one of the best libraries to implement Deep Learning. TensorFlow is a software library for numerical computation of mathematical expressions, using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) that flow between them. It was created by Google and tailored for Machine Learning. In fact, it is being widely used to develop solutions with Deep Learning. \n\nGot a question on the topic?
