title: 'Taming WebSocket with Scarlet - Zhixuan Lai'
recordingDate: 1574090076
description: 'Despite being a well-established standard for bidirectional persistent connection between client and server, WebSocket is complicated to set up on Android. When Tinder migrated to WebSocket for its realtime chat experience, they developed Scarlet: an extensible Kotlin library inspired by Retrofit that eliminates the boilerplate code required to handle data serialization and specify when to connect and retry. After this talk, youâ€™ll be able to configure Scarlet using many of its plugins and integrate any WebSocket API in 10 minutes.'
