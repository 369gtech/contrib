description: "Speaker: Dr Karthik Muthuswamy\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we continue our journey of using TensorFlow to build an ML solution for text data. We build our application for analysing text and reporting its sentiment.\_ We'll discuss the theory behind building a sentiment analyser and write our own sentiment analyser using TensorFlow and Google's Cloud NLP API. We will also discuss other capabilities of Google's Cloud NLP API and show how to leverage the API to extend our ML application for other tasks such as identifying people, places and syntax of a sentence to derive insights from unstructured text.\_ \r\n\r\nSpeaker Bio:\r\n\r\nDr Karthik Muthuswamy is a Google Developer Expert in Machine Learning. \r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/GCPUGSG/events/239103206/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/6NMI/"
