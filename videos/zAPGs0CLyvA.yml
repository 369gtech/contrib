description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM STO 19 http://bit.ly/2W2vgDC\n\nGet involved in Code Sync's next conference http://bit.ly/2Mcm4aS\n\n---\n\nTHINK IN ERLANG!\nby Viktória Fördős\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\n#ThinkInErlang \nSimple solutions\nProblem-solving method\n\nTALK LEVEL: Beginner\n\nABSTRACT\nHave you ever felt that a solution is too complicated?\n\nIn this talk, you are going to learn a universal recipe that you can use every day to provide simple solutions to complex problems. We start with the philosophy of Erlang and learn its key messages. Then we study how these core thoughts are baked into Erlang/OTP, and why they help. Then we are going to see how Cisco NSO engineers created a patented algorithm to solve a complex problem: orchestrating network services. Yes, using the same recipe!\n\nRead the full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/viktoria-foerdos/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - VIKTÓRIA FÖRDŐS\nErlanger @ Cisco NSO Core\n\nViktória first came in contact with Erlang in 2010 when she joined the RefactorErl project.  Has been active in R&D, and of course in Erlang, ever since. She was contributing to FP7 EU projects (PharaPhrase, RELEASE, SYNCFREE), co-authored papers in the ACM SIGPLAN Erlang Workshop, in ‘Proceedings of Trends in Functional Programming’ (TFP), in ‘Lecture Notes in Computer Science’ (LNCS), in Computer Languages Systems & Structures (COMLAN), in ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems, and in IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems. She was Member of Program Committee for the ACM Erlang Workshop between 2016 and 2018. She is Co-chair for the ACM Erlang Workshop 2019.\n She joined Cisco Systems in 2019. She is an NSO core engineer, she solves (network orchestration) problems in Erlang everyday.\n\nMore on Viktória Fördős: https://codesync.global/speaker/viktoria-foerdos/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM STO 19\nCode BEAM STO is powered by Code Sync.
