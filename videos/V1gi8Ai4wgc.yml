language: English
recordingDate: 1639242017
description: "Web services development, no matter JSON or SOAP, is today easy like adding an annotation to a method. For API development you don’t need much more than OAS (Swagger). But how to create complex yet simple interfaces and provide consistent access to a wide variety of many APIs, e.g. microservices? How to create a friendly system for both developers and consumers (web, mobile, fridge ...)? What is the way to avoid duplications of cross-cutting services concerns like security or network support? Discover the possibilities, strengths and drawbacks of open source solutions and learn how to implement API Gateway for monolith, microservices or IoT.
