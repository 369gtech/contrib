description: "One-shot learning! In this last weekly video of the course, i'll explain how memory augmented neural networks can help achieve one-shot classification for a small labeled image dataset. We'll also go over the architecture of it's inspiration (the neural turing machine).\n\nCode for this video (with challenge):\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/How-to-Learn-from-Little-Data\n\nPlease subscribe!
