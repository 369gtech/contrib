description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nIntegrating Fluent Bit Into a PaaS- Bojan Djurkovic & Dhruv Kela, DigitalOcean\n\nAt DigitalOcean App Platform we use Fluent Bit for log processing of internal components and for customer-facing functionality. This session will review how we collect internal logs from dozens of Kubernetes clusters into a centralized logging system utilizing a custom plugin. We will also describe how we dynamically configure Fluent Bit for customer applications' log processing. This presented several operational, scalability, and security considerations. Orchestrating Fluent Bit in a security-restricted environment proved challenging. We also need detailed observability into applications' logging pipeline health and metrics. Different implementation approaches and potential future improvements will be discussed."
