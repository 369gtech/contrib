title: 'RSocket Messaging with Spring'
language: English
recordingDate: 1571234620
description: "RSocket is a protocol that enables high-performance message passing over a multiplexed connection using a pluggable byte stream transport such as TCP, WebSockets, UDP, or other. The passing of messages follows Reactive Streams semantics (i.e., respecting demand signals), and there are libraries in multiple languages, including Java built on Project Reactor. This means the back pressure from your reactive chain of components within the JVM can now extend across the network boundary to remote peers. \n\nThis session covers the upcoming RSocket support in the Spring Framework, Spring Boot, and Spring Security. It's intended as an introduction to RSocket from a Spring application perspective and will include a succinct overview of the RSocket protocol essentials necessary to follow the rest of the session.\n\nRossen Stoyanchev: Spring Framework Engineer, Pivotal\nBrian Clozel: Spring Team member, Pivotal\nRob Winch: Spring Security Lead, Pivotal\n\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2019\nSlides:  https://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/rsocket-messaging-with-spring"
