description: "Speaker: Gabe Hollombe (AWS)\n\nRapid mobile API development with GraphQL and Amazon AppSync\nFacebook has been using GraphQL internally since 2012 and since its public release in 2015, GraphQL has won the hearts of developers at many companies including Facebook, GitHub, Pinterest, Shopify, and Twitter. Developers love GraphQL because it provides a clean separation of concerns between how their apps request and mutate data and how those queries and commands are fulfilled.\n\nAmazon AppSync is a new servivce from AWS that makes it easy to automatically update the data in web and mobile applications in real time, and to handle offline data changes too! AppSync uses GraphQL to make it easy for developers to work with their data in the cloud.\n\nThis talk assumes that attendees have some experience building web APIs (no GraphQL experience is required). All code samples will be in JavaScript.\n\nGabe Hollombe is a Technical Evangelist for AWS. He’s an experienced full-stack developer, comfortable building client-side single-page apps or back-end APIs and services. With a voracious thirst for knowledge and a passion for sharing what he’s learned, Gabe is a friendly and compelling speaker.\n\nGabe’s favorite movie is The Princess Bride, sushi is his desert island food, and he enjoys playing D&D with his friends. He’s also the creator of the fun and addictive bee-themed puzzle game called PollenNation!, available for free for iOS and Android."
