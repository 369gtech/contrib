title: 'SignalR Deep Dive: Building Servers - David Fowler & Damian Edwards'
language: English
recordingDate: 1581588270
description: "You’ve likely already seen that SignalR supports multiple client types, including .NET, JavaScript, and Java. But what about the server side? Could we build a SignalR server in something other than .NET? Go perhaps, or Node.js? If so, what would you learn? Why would you do it? How would you even begin?\n\nIn this session, David and Damian from the ASP.NET team will explore what goes into building a SignalR server that can speak to any SignalR client. You’ll come away with a better understanding of exactly how SignalR works, and perhaps even ideas on how to extend SignalR further for your needs.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks, courses, and conferences in the following links:\nhttps://ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
