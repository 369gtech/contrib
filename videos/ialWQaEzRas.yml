description: "Evolution of the Google Data Protocol: New Features for Building more Efficient Applications - Sven Mawson\r\n\r\nFor those who are attending Google I/O 2009(http://code.google.com/io/), these video are an opportunity to hear from some of the speakers in advance. The speakers introduce their topic and provide a preview of one or more topics that will be covered in their talks.\r\n\r\nRecently, Google Data APIs have implemented new technologies in order to make applications and communications with Google Data APIs more efficient. We'll present these new technologies, including ETags, Partial Get and Update, and a new compact JSON format, and show how you can use them to improve your applications. We'll demonstrate these features by showing an example built on top of the Google Photos (Picasa Web Album) API."
