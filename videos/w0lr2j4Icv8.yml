description: "Upcoming JS Conference:\nJS Fest 2020 - 3-4th of April, Kiev, Ukraine\nDetails and tickets: http://bit.ly/364jtpv\n\n\nThe talk from JS Fest conference in Kyiv, Ukraine.\nPresentation: https://bit.ly/2WV17mv\nFb: https://www.facebook.com/JSFestua/\nWebsite: http://jsfest.com.ua/\n\nGeneric web layouts have become somewhat of a misnomer in conversations circling around web design these days. As creatives, we're bored and slightly annoyed by how predictable and uninspired most web experiences have become. How do we break out of predictable and boring designs without breaking the usability and functionality of our experiences? \nIn this talk, Vitaly Friedman will shed some light into a strategy of how to bring personality back to web design, and how we can make our experiences more humane while also having a higher ROI. Beware: you might not be able to unlearn what you'll learn in this session. Bonus: you'll see some slightly dirty examples of things being done out there, so bring along some pragmatism to this talk."
