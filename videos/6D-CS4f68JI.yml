description: "This video was recorded at Scala Days Copenhagen 2017\nFollow us on Twitter @ScalaDays or visit our website for more information http://scaladays.org \n\nAbstract:\nVert.x is a polyglott toolkit to build reactive applications on the JVM. It is based on a simple yet powerful threading concept and provides very easy cluster managed. \nI will introduce the brand new Scala-stack that has just been added to the core framework and opens all its capabilities to the Scala-world. The main topics of this talk will be:\n- a walkthrough for the current stack and available modules\n- bootstrapping an SBT-Vert.x-project with the provided project blueprint\n- running, testing and deploying of Vert.x-microservices\n- how Scala enhances the Vert.x programming experience\n- a full demo of an elastic Vert.x-cluster \n\nExpect a lot of code and room for discussions."
