title: '"Web Apps in Clojure and ClojureScript with Pedestal" by Brenton Ashworth'
language: English
recordingDate: 1614358187
description: "This talk will introduce the Pedestal application library as a way to build rich collaborative applications in Clojure and ClojureScript.\n\nPedestal applies many of the best ideas from Clojure to client application development, allowing developers to create complex applications without having to write complex code. Pedestal applications are a composition of pure functions and dataflow, run by an engine which handles the complexities of managing state. You will leave this talk knowing when and how to use Pedestal and hopefully thinking a bit differently about how to build applications.\n\nBrenton Ashworth\nCognitect\n@brentonashworth\n\nBrenton Ashworth is a developer at Cognitect (formerly Relevance, Inc). He was involved in the development of ClojureScript, building some of its first tools, as well as working on the first ClojureScript application, TwitterBuzz. Since then, he has worked on ClojureScript One, Pedestal and many other applications which leverage Clojure from the database to the UI.\n\n\nRecorded at Strange Loop conference (https://thestrangeloop.com) in St. Louis, MO, Oct 2013."
