description: "Ближайшая конференция:\nHolyJS 2019 Piter — 24-25 мая 2019, Санкт-Петербург\nПодробности и билеты: http://bit.ly/2P4jIYM\n\nMichel является автором MobX и детально изучает проблему state management. Он поделится с нами свежим взглядом на эту столь непростую проблему.\n\nMany battles have been fought over what is the best way to do state management. A gazillion of strategies and libraries are out there. So... it is time to take one step back.\n\nWhy is state management relevant in the first place? What problems does it solve? For example, many debates are about mutability or immutability. But Michel thinks that the more fundamental question to ask is: identities or values?\n\nWith these concepts in mind, we will take a look at several libraries and frameworks and recognize the patterns. We will look at the advantages and disadvantages of different approaches. Finally, Michel will show that those concepts are highly interchangeable with a PoC that will blow your mind. Michel's goal is to enable you to reason about state on a far more fundamental level, resulting in better system design and earlier recognition of bugs."
