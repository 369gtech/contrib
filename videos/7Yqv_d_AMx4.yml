title: 'Sam Scott - Building a programming language  | March 2021'
language: Spanish
recordingDate: 1621052435
description: "We built our own programming language, Polar: hear why and what we learned along the way.\n\nAt the beginning of 2020, we set out to build a system to help developers add authorization to their apps. Part of this includes modeling authorization logic, like who's allowed to do what. We tried a handful of approaches, and ultimately landed on building our own programming language to represent these patterns called, Polar, which is based on Prolog but looks more like Javascript and Python. In this talk, Sam Scott will share how we built Polar and client libraries for 5 languages – including Node.JS using WASM – our growing pains, and what you should know if ever you decide to scratch the language itch too."
