title: 'DEF CON 29 Blockchain Village - Shinchul Park, Seungjoo Kim - Blockchain as a Threat Modeling Tool'
language: English
recordingDate: 1631046469
description: "Threat modelling is a risk-based approach to designing secure systems. It is based on identifying threats in order to develop mitigations to them. Threat modeling is a “team sport,” because it requires the knowledge and skill set of a diverse team where all inputs can be viewed as equal in value. As the enabler of mass collaboration, blockchain is the framework that pieces everything together at a larger scale. \n\nIn this talk, we propose the first platform that combines blockchain with threat modeling. To this end, we first present a system model that combines a blockchain-based collective intelligence system with threat modeling, and then explain the role of the model, the scheme of the tool, and the operation procedure."
