title: 'What is Explainable Artificial Intelligence? - Senka Krivic'
recordingDate: 1621341072
description: "The effectiveness of AI algorithms has led to their success and the vast possibility of applications. However, their usage limitation is the machine’s current inability to explain their decisions and actions to human users. Explainable AI is an emerging field that aims to provide methods and processes that allow human users to comprehend and trust their outcome.\n\nSenka Krivic\nSenka Krivić is a Research Associate at King’s College London. She received bachelor's and master's degrees in Control and Electronics at the University of Sarajevo and PhD degree in Computer Science at the University of Innsbruck.\n\nSenka's research covers topics at the intersection of robotics, artificial intelligence, machine learning, planning and explainable AI with the main focus on enabling a robust operation of autonomous systems in real-world environments under uncertainty and in interaction with humans. She has several publications in international peer-reviewed journals and conferences, such as Autonomous Robots, JAIR, IJCAI, IROS, CASE, ESANN, etc.\n\nhttps://senka2112.github.io/senka.krivic/\n\n___________________________\nFoo Café is a meeting place for people with an interest in software development and IT. \nHere, user groups and partner companies find the perfect atmosphere for sharing knowledge and develop competence. \nFoo Café is open for everyone and is free to attend.
