description: "Autopsy of a MySQL Automation Disaster\n\nJean-François Gagné, MessageBird\n\nYou deployed automation, enabled automatic database master failover and tested it many times: great, you can now sleep at night without being paged by a failing server. However, when you wake up in the morning, things might not have gone the way you expect. This talk will be about such a surprise.\n\nOnce upon a time, a failure brought down a MySQL master database. Automation kicked in and fixed things. However, a fancy failure, combined with human errors, an edge-case recovery, and a lack of oversight in tooling and scripting lead to a split-brain and data corruption.

I cover what could have avoided the split-brain and what could have made data reconciliation easier.\n\nView the full SREcon19 Europe/Middle East/Africa Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon19emea/program \n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
