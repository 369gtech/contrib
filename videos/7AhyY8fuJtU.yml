title: 'JSR 353: JSON Processing API in Action'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433517028
description: "JSON is a lightweight data exchange format used increasingly in RESTful Web services by highly visible Websites (Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, and the like). The format is easy for humans and machines to read and write. JSON is quickly becoming the primary choice for developers for consuming and creating Web services. JSR 353: Java API for JSON Processing intends to create a standard Java API for JSON so that the applications that use the API are smaller and portable. The goal of the API is to produce/consume JSON text in a streaming fashion and also to build a Java object model for JSON text. This session describes the API and its usage in different applications.\n\n\nAuthor:\nJitendra Kotamraju\nundefined\nView more trainings by Jitendra Kotamraju at https://www.parleys.com/author/jitendra-kotamraju\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
