title: 'Webinar: The Open-Source Observability Playbook'
language: English
recordingDate: 1597263834
description: "Observability within distributed systems is essential to understanding how your application is performing and establishing application reliability. In this talk, we will discuss the rise of microservices in the cloud, the pillars of observability (metrics, logs and traces), and open source tools for tracing such as OpenTelemetry, as well as OpenTracing and OpenCensus. The goal is to understand the tools themselves, as well as discuss best practices in using them. Using the right tools and best practices can accelerate application development, ensure that applications perform as expected, and reduce user impacts.\n\nPresenter:\n\nHen Peretz, Head of Solutions Engineering @Epsagon"
