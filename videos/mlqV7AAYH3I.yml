description: "From the 2014 Velocity Conference in New York City, the Developer Evangelist at Librato discusses their alerting system, combating alert fatigue, and more.\n\nAbout David Josephson (Librato):\nDavid Josephsen is the “Developer Evangelist” at librato.com. His continuing mission: To help engineers world-wide close the feedback loop. He is also a sometime book-authoring blogger and purveyor of awkward conference talks.\n\nHe has never (not even once) used non-local goto. He speaks shell, Go, C, Python, Perl and a little bit of Spanish (in that order), and apologizes in advance for that thing he said (not the first thing, the other one. That first thing he totally meant to say and he refuses to redact it).\n\nWatch more from the 2014 Velocity New York Conference: http://goo.gl/kmrqJF\nFind out more about Velocity: http://velocityconf.com/\n\nDon't miss an upload!
