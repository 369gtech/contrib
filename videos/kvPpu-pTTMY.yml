description: "By Roy Clarkson\n\nThis session will provide an introductory overview of Android's architecture, the layout of an Android project, the use of various Maven plugins and tools for enabling dependency management in your Android project. When building Android apps, you can use a third party library, like Spring Android, that provides an abstraction for consuming RESTful services within your native Android app. Spring Android also supports the use of Spring Social on Android, and we will discuss how Spring Social can help you connect your apps to OAuth protected services like Facebook and Twitter."
