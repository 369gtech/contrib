description: "Paketo Buildpacks, From Source Code to Application Images - Daniel Thornton, VMWare \n\nFor more info: https://www.cloudfoundry.org/ \n\nAs CF for Kubernetes continues to grow, the process for pushing source code to production will still be as simple as running 'cf push'. But, the build path that your application travels from source to running container has changed. The buildpacks responsible for adding the dependencies an application needs have been completely reimagined.\n\nBuilding on top of the experience building and maintaining Cloud Foundry Buildpacks comes the Paketo Project. It aims to resolve the technical and organizational issues that affected the old CloudFoundry Buildpacks.\n\nThis talk will address how Paketo Buildpacks reshape the buildpack experience to be modular, extensible and approachable."
