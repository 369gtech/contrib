title: 'Getting Started with GitHub Actions - Mickey Gousset - NDC London 2021'
language: English
recordingDate: 1623753090
description: 'GitHub Actions enable you to create custom software development lifecycle workflows directly in your GitHub repository. You can create tasks, called "actions", and combine them to create custom workflows to build, test, package, release and/or deploy any code project on GitHub. In this session you will learn the ins and outs of GitHub Actions, and walk away with workflows and ideas that you can start using in your own repos immediately.'
