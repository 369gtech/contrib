recordingDate: 1380114018
description: "CSSconf.eu - http://cssconf.eu - Berlin, September 13, 2013\n\nSlides: tba\n\nTalk description: \"Transforms are incredibly powerful and immensely helpful when we want to create any kind of polygon starting from humble rectangles. Or when we want to take these polygonal shapes and assemble them into polyhedra. Or even when we want to create various 3D surfaces starting from nothing more than a curvy border. Understanding the mathematical reasoning behind these transforms allows you to achieve wonderful and visually stunning effects.\"\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
