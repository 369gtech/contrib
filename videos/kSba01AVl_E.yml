description: "Think about almost everything you use an Activity for. Now replace the word Activity with Fragment. That's right, in a single activity app you start using fragments for almost everything. From UI to navigation, this is all better from a Fragment. In this talk Remco will be using real world examples on how single-activity will help you have a more reusable, maintainable and cleaner codebase.\n\nAt IO 2018, Google published more architecture guidelines as well as a new navigation library. These both push for a Fragment-heavy, single-activity approach. We had the opportunity to apply this pattern in some of our apps. In one we decided to take a leap of faith and completely go single activity. We converted all our activities, at that point, to fragments and have not regretted this decision for a second.\n\nThis talk will be covering navigation patterns, handling certain UI elements and system features like window insets, supporting Instant apps, analytics, and more.\n\nhttps://it.droidcon.com/2019/it\nhttps://twitter.com/droidconit\nhttps://www.facebook.com/droidconIt"
