description: "pratik patel, CTO, TripLingo\n\nThe use of JavaScript on the command line and server has exploded over the past couple of years. Node.js has become popular with development shops, from startups to big corporations. Given its asynchronous nature, JavaScript provides the ability to scale dramatically. Besides the ability to drive your server-side applications, there are several tools that help with all aspects of browser development: testing, packaging, and deployment.
