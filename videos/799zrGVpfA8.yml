description: "Hey my good friends, in this CSS tutorial for beginners we're going to dive head-first into the font-size property. The font-size property in CSS, believe it or not, controls how large the font displays in a browser. \n\nWe can control font size either via absolute or relative measurements, and we'll cover both types in this video. Absolute font sizes are immutable (unless overridden later in the CSS), whereas relative font sizes are determined largely by the base font size they inherit.\n\nFor my video on CSS inheritance, check out  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMpaebQ3n6A&index=11&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gQeDH6xYhmO-db2mhoTSrT\n\nAnyway, peace out, keep coding & have fun :).\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO CHANNEL - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n========== CSS for Beginners Playlist ==========\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gQeDH6xYhmO-db2mhoTSrT\n========== HTML Basics Course ==========\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9ibZ2TSBaGGNrgh4ZgYE6Cc\n\n========== The Net Ninja ============\n\nFor more front-end development tutorials & to black-belt your coding skills, head over to - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg or http://thenetninja.co.uk\n\n========== Social Links ==========\n\nTwitter - @TheNetNinja - https://twitter.com/thenetninjauk"
