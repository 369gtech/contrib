recordingDate: 1630943995
description: "From a very young age, we learn that if smart people work hard and grow up in a reasonably nurturing environment, success would come eventually. But over time, we realized that’s not necessarily the case. A very few people we know who are intelligent and have a strong work ethic have gone on to do notable things. The vast majority of people we know are doing OK. Unfortunately, there are even those who drift along, unsure about what to do.\n\nThere are a lot of factors when it comes to success, whether it means having a fulfilling career, having great relationships, or staying healthy. Being smart and working hard are definitely part of it. But there’s more at play than just these two factors.\n\nThis video presents seven reasons why you might not be finding success even if you’re smart and hardworking."
