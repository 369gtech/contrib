description: "In lab 200, you will assume the role of Derek and create a Kubernetes cluster. We will leverage Terraform to configure and provision our cluster. Terraform is a open source tool that greatly simplifies managing infrastructure for any Cloud provider. Once created you will deploy your product catalog microservice and user interface through a Wercker Pipeline. You'll also create both internal and external facing services in Kubernetes to expose some of your application's microservices to the internet.\n\nHands on Lab Material & Code\nhttps://go.oracle.com/container-native-development\n\nOverview: Container Native Application Development\nhttps://youtu.be/9n8JMlvjFiw\n\nLab 100 Deep Dive: Container Native Application Development\nhttps://youtu.be/PCAm4FvL-Fw\n\nLab 200 Deep Dive: Container Native Application Development\nhttps://youtu.be/50GKxGqj7dU\n\nLab 300 Deep Dive: Container Native Application Development\nhttps://youtu.be/23wI7wrv8RU\n\nLab 400 Deep Dive: Container Native Application Development\nhttps://youtu.be/6YvuQo-vS_U\n\nLab 500 Deep Dive: Container Native Application Development\nhttps://youtu.be/ecx53tAwegk"
