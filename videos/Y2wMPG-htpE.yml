language: English
recordingDate: 1571239323
description: "In the Java world, it's been a couple years since Spring Framework 5 and Spring Boot 2 have published their new Reactive Programming features based on Project Reactor. During this period, the team has collected feedback, benchmarks, and other developer experiences.\n\nThis session is an invitation to navigate that valuable information together. Our goal? Building a decision-making template to assist you if/when you're thinking about Reactive architectures for your next system. We'll examine:\n-why you should care\n-what the tradeoffs are and what's being done to address them\n-what benefits we should expect for various common modern use cases\n-what the future holds for cloud-native systems and beyond\n\nSpeakers: Violeta Georgieva, Principal Software Engineer, Pivotal; Stephane Maldini, Reactive Engineering, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2019\nSlideShare: https://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/the-value-of-reactive-systems"
