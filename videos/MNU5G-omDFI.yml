description: "Lightning Talk presented by Michael Behrendt, Senior Technical Staff Member, Cloud & Smarter Infrastructure CTO Office, IBM\n\nTo accomplish high degrees of resiliency & scale and minimize latency, it is required to deploy Cloud Foundry across multiple geographically distributed data centers. That implies a number of architectural considerations, such as:\n\n- How to expose a single point of entry for deploying an application into such a globally distributed environment\n- How to allow the developer to explicitly select a data center for deploying an app\n- How to make it as easy as possible for the developer to expose an app via a single URL, even if it's deployed in more than one data center"
