title: 'Deconstructing Deep Learning by Mark West'
recordingDate: 1581886629
description: "Attend this session for a mathematics and jargon free introduction to Deep Learning and Artificial Neural Networks! The talk is split into three sections as follows:\n\nI’ll start by outlining the general principles and theory behind Deep Learning.\n\nNext up I’ll explain the inner workings of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and show how these can be utilised for Image Processing.\n\nFinally I’ll give insight into how Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) can be used for Natural Language Processing.\n\nI’ll also share links and instructions for playing around with implementations of the above Artificial Neural Networks using Keras, TensorFlow and Google Colab.\n\nMark West\nBouvet\n\nRecorded at Jfokus 2020 in Stockholm 4th of february\nhttp://www.jfokus.se"
