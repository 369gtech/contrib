description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2012\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nStephen Fink - Research Staff Member at the IBM T. J. Watson Research Center\n\nABSTRACT\nFuture chips will feature heterogeneous architectures with multicores, graphics processors (GPUs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and various fixed function accelerators. This talk will present an overview of the IBM Liquid Metal project, which aims to bring the power of these heterogenous systems to mainstream programmers.\n\nWe have developed a programming language called Lime, with first-class language constructs that unify several parallel programming paradigms. The Liquid Metal toolchain compiles Lime applications to run on a number of platforms, and the runtime transparently manages scheduling, communication, and task migration.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
