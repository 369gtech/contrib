recordingDate: 1331864878
description: "Relying simply on old school SEO metrics like PageRank and link popularity just doesn't cut it anymore, and red herring stats like keyword density lead you astray. You want to win the Google game but you're not sure what to measureâ€”or how. Which SEO metrics do you choose to judge progress towards your goals?\n\nIt's time to find out what to measure and what to ignore! Rather than relying on old-school SEO metrics such as PageRank, rankings, and link popularity, or meaningless metrics such as \"keyword density\" or KEI (Keyword Effectiveness Index), you should be considering SEO metrics such as brand-to-nonbrand ratio, index-to-crawl ratio, search traffic per page, visitors per keyword, and many others. In this webcast, we'll explore the full range of useful SEO metrics and how to leverage them for SEO success.\n\n-How to identify and remedy weaknesses in your SEO to prevent bleeding away PageRank, traffic, and sales\n-How to prioritize your efforts, allocate resources, and budget effectively\n-Which tools to use to get the job done\n-How to capitalize on long tail SEO opportunities\n\nAbout Stephan Spencer:\n\nStephan Spencer is author of Google Power Search and co-author of The Art of SEO.
