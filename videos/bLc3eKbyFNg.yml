title: 'James Hughes - The Twelve Factor App Methodology'
language: English
recordingDate: 1443200543
description: 'The 12 factor app is a methodology (their words not mine, sorry) for building web apps in such a way that they can be deployed, scaled and configured easily. Think it of some battle tested advice that can make the process of delivering software a bit less painful. In this talk I''ll go over the the twelve points that make up the methodology (there''s that word again) and show you what problems each one attempts to avoid. I''ll also try and drag up some of my repressed memories of terrible deployments and architectural decisions just to show you how bad things can be.'
