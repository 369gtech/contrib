description: "An introduction about the world of Drone Racing, an exciting new sport. How does it work? How do you build a racing drone yourself? Experienced drone racing pilots will talk you through it all. Be aware, you will find yourself spending a lot of money after you are hooked to this amazing sport.\n\nAfter this session a live demo will be given in the cinema hallway. At 19h30 they'll move to a close parking lot (next to the Kinepolis venue) for a faster and more spacious demonstration."
