description: "Keynote: Getting Started in the Kubernetes Community - Lucas Käldström, CNCF Ambassador, Independent & Nikhita Raghunath, Software Engineer, Loodse  \n\nKubernetes is its community. Kubernetes is where it is today only because of the people behind it. The foundation of this thriving community lies on the Kubernetes Community Values. In this talk, we will take a look at what they are, why they are so important and how they shaped our growing ecosystem. By first focusing on the core values, we’ll give the audience an idea of *what* it means to be involved and *why* they should contribute. After that, we will talk about *how* they can get started with contributing, move up the contributor ladder and become a regular contributor who serves the project. Lastly, we’ll look at some stories about how the existing contributors got started with their journey. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MRdg"
