description: 'Grooscript is a library that converts groovy code to javascript (http://grooscript.org). Is a new tool that you can introduce in your web projects. I''ll present it, the good parts and their limitations.Later, we will use it in a spring boot or grails 3 project. We will use domain classes in the server and the client. We will inspect a dynamic single page application created in groovy, all parts tested with Spock. Ast''s, dsl''s and traits will be used, grooscript will convert to js, and will run in the browser. We will use websockets to speed up development reloading pages on the fly. Finally, I''ll show node.js support.Javascript is the new wave, and sure you have to use any js tool. With grooscript, you can use js libs in a groovy way, very funny experience.'
