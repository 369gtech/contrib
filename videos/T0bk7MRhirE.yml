title: 'Data Ownership (Swapp Protocol & Zero-Knowledge Proofs)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1620424017
description: "SWAPP is a decentralized, fairly launched, ETH-paired utility token used to both facilitate yield farming on the Swapp DeFi platform as well as serve as the form of rewards within the Swapp smartphone app (on ios and android soon). The real-world application of Swapp comes in the form of users installing the smartphone app and authorizing their existing social media (and other) accounts to share data. This creates a unique scenario whereby the tech giant middlemen are removed from that part of the equation and 100% of the data monetization revenue is passed back to users in the form of SWAPP tokens. This model feels similar to that of Brave Browser and how they reward users with BAT tokens for simply surfing the web, but with Swapp user need to just “Install, Authorize, and EARN!”. In this short video, I'll explain how swapp protocol aims to help users monetize their data, as advertisers currently send profits directly to platforms. Then we'll discuss how a technique called 'zero knowledge proof's on Ethereum improves transaction throughput substantially.\n\nSwapp Protocol:\nhttps://swapp.ee/\n\nSwapp DeFi Platform:\nhttps://dapp.swapp.ee/\n\nTwitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/swappfi\n\nNote* in the video i say its possible to reserve swap tokens using various tokens, but as of right now we can only deposit ETH for swapp tokens\n\nZero Knowledge Proof Example:\nhttps://github.com/raphaelrrcoelho/zk-snarks/blob/master/zk-snarks.py\n\nThis video was sponsored by Swapp Protocol \nSubscribe for more educational videos!"
