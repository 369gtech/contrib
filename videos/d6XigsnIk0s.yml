title: 'Tech Mesh 2012 - Deterministic Parallel Programming with Haskell - Duncan Coutts'
language: English
recordingDate: 1377161307
description: "You want to make your code run faster, so you think about changing it to run in parallel to use multiple cores. But most approaches to parallelism also force you to rewrite your program using explicit concurrency which means you'll always worry about race conditions, deadlocks and other concurrency bugs. Deterministic parallelism frees you from concurrency bugs and gives a strong guarantee that your program remains deterministic, so it will give the same result no matter the number of cores or the scheduling being used.\n\nHaskell offers a variety of libraries for deterministic parallelism that enable concise high-level parallel programs. In this talk we will look at the idea of parallelism without concurrency and give an overview of the paradigms that Haskell offers in this area. \n\n\n\n\n\nLiked the song?
