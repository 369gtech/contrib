description: "Full title: Jens Fredrik Skogstrom: What we learned by running a large custom Bayesian forecasting model in production | PyData NYC 2019\n\nAt Kolonial.no we built and implemented our own custom Bayesian forecasting model in PyMC3 - and learned a lot in the process. In this talk, we share our thoughts on when to do what we did, and more important, when not to do it. We also share how we stumbled into numerous pitfalls on the way but managed to climb out again.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
