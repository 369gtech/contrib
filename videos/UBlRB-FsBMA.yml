description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nSimplifying Windows runtime and deployment in Kubernetes - Muzz Imam, Microsoft & Michael Michael, VMware \n\nThe leaders of SIG-Windows will provide an update on the efforts to bring Windows to Kubernetes. This session will concentrate on presenting new features and capabilities as well as focus on advanced capabilities like Kubeadm support, ContainerD integration, and Cluster API for Windows. At the end, we will open the floor for Q&A with customers and members of the SIG-Windows community. Some familiarity with Windows on Kubernetes is required for the deep dive part since we will have an in-depth discussion on key features that are in the pipeline for Windows, explain their implementation and have a discussion on trade-offs with the community.\n\nhttps://sched.co/ZeyK"
