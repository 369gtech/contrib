language: English
recordingDate: 1624264689
description: "Large amounts of data and rapidly changing requirements demand a new approach to add business intelligence into your web applications. Agility matters. You no longer want to write and maintain any custom front-end code while still providing rich analytics to your customers.\n\nIn this session, we are going to discuss BI services such as Microsoft Power BI, Amazon QuickSight, and Tableau, and experience they provide to you and your users. We will explore how you can create interactive dashboards to dig deeper into your data and get better insights. We will investigate embedding scenarios when you want to present your charts and diagrams to your customers and talk about authorization and security. As cost is one of the important aspects for the business, we will also cover cost aspects of various solutions."
