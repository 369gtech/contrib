recordingDate: 1415008950
description: "The Nordic Playlist is a new way to discover the most exciting sounds in the Nordic region. Every week, a trusted artist or tastemaker compiles a 10-track playlist consisting of two of their favourite tunes from each of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden which users can then stream on Deezer, Spotify or WiMP. Users can also access recommended new artists, the Nordic Top 10 chart, and last but by no means least, specially created DJ mixes from the regionâ€™s most prominent music makers. \n\nEditor Francine Gorman will present the concept and functions of the Nordic Playlist, and then invite participants to join a discussion about the use of curation on websites, the benefits of such services for artists and best practices when it comes to promoting music through streaming services.\n\nRead more:\nhttps://www.berlin-music-week.de/de/konferenz/program/program-uebersicht/conference/partner/panel/82/\n\nAbout Francine Gorman:\nhttps://www.berlin-music-week.de/de/konferenz/program/speakers/francine-gorman/"
