description: "Speaker: Daniele Polencic - Instructor, Learnk8s\n\nWhen you deploy an application in Kubernetes, your code ends up running on one or more worker nodes. A node may be a physical machine or VM such as AWS EC2 or Google Compute Engine and having several of them means you can run and scale your application across instances efficiently. When there is an incoming request, the cluster routes the traffic to one of the nodes using a network proxy. But what happens when network proxy crashes? Does the cluster still work? Can Kubernetes recover from the failure?\nIn this talk, you'll learn how the traffic is distributed within a Kubernetes cluster and what happens when the network proxy is misbehaving.\n\nAbout the Speaker\n\nDaniele is a technical consultant and instructor based in London and Singapore. Daniele is a certified Kubernetes administrator by the Linux Foundation. In the last decade, Daniele trained developers for companies in the e-commerce, finance and public sector.\n\nSlides: http://bit.ly/2UiIAmp\n\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/Singapore-Kubernetes-User-Group/events/259921744/\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\nRecorded by: Michael Cheng\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/oM5e/"
