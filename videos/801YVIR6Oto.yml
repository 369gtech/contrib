They usually pick a statically configured default interface, such as WiFi, which they prefer over LTE when both are available, but this is not necessarily the choice that provides the best performance to the application. Socket Intents is a research prototype that addresses the problem of finding policies of which network interface to pick for what kind of traffic or application. It provides several networking APIs through which an application can specify its \"Intents\", i.e., what it knows or assumes about its own traffic. The prototype then decides which of the available network interfaces to use.\n\n\n\nTheresa Enghardt"
